 STAMPER-KURN GROUP DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
 
 THIS MURI PROJECT WILL SUPPORT ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AND ONE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER WORKING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR DAN STAMPER-KURN. THE PROJECT PERSONNEL WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH ON QUANTUM ENHANCED METROLOGY REALIZED WITH ENSEMBLES OF ULTRACOLD ATOMS TRAPPED WITHIN AND INTERROGATED VIA A HIGH FINESSE OPTICAL RESONATOR. THIS WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MURI RESEARCH TEAM. SPECIFIC WORK TO BE CONDUCTED AND YEARLY OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
 YEAR 1: DISSIPATIVE PREPARATION OF ENTANGLED STATE OF SPIN ENSEMBLE IN THE RESOLVED- SIDEBAND REGIME.
 
 YEAR 2: DISSIPATIVE PREPARATION OF ENTANGLED STATES OF MECHANICAL MOTION IN THE UNRESOLVED SIDEBAND REGIME, AND DEMONSTRATION OF QUANTUM ENHANCED METROLOGY OF MAGNETIC FIELD AND OF FORCES USING DISSIPATIVELY PREPARED SQUEEZED STATES.
 
 YEAR 3: DEMONSTRATION OF BACKACTION EVADING FORCE SENSING USING THE ATOMIC MOTION OF SEVERAL ATOMIC ENSEMBLES WITHIN AN OPTICAL SUPERLATTICE.
 
 YEAR 4: GENERATION OF TWO-MODE SQUEEZING WITHIN AN ARRAY OF ATOMIC ENSEMBLES, DEMONSTRATED FOR BOTH SPIN AND MECHANICAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM.
 
 YEAR 5: DEMONSTRATION OF QUANTUM ENHANCED MAGNETIC-FIELD DIFFERENCE SENSING THROUGH USE OF TWO-MODE SQUEEZING OF SPIN ENSEMBLES.
 
 YAO GROUP DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
 THIS MURI PROJECT WILL SUPPORT ONE GRADUATE STUDENT WORKING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR NORMAN YAO, WHO WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH ON USING DIPOLAR INTERACTIONS TO REALIZE SPIN SQUEEZING IN A CENTRAL SPIN MODEL AS WELL AS A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR WHO WILL FOCUS ON EXPLORING NEW TECHNIQUES FOR ENHANCED METROLOGY BASED ON MANY-BODY CRITICAL POINTS. THIS
 
  
 
 WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MURI RESEARCH TEAM. SPECIFIC WORK TO BE CONDUCTED AND YEARLY MILESTONES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 YEAR 1: WE WILL DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO UTILIZE A COMBINATION OF DRIVING AND DIPOLAR INTERACTIONS TO REALIZE SPIN SQUEEZING. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT GROUND STATES OF CERTAIN LONG-RANGE INTERACTING SPIN MODELS CAN HARBOR METROLOGICALLY USEFUL ENTANGLEMENT AS MEASURED BY THE QUANTUM FISHER INFORMATION.
 YEAR 2: USING A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CENTRAL SPIN MODEL BASED UPON NV CENTERS AND P1 CENTERS IN DIAMOND, WE WILL EXPLORE THE DYNAMICS OF ENTANGLEMENT AND ATTEMPT TO MEASURE THE EMERGENT DIFFUSION CONSTANT IN A DISORDERED DIPOLAR SPIN ENSEMBLE.
 YEAR 3: USING SPECIALLY FABRICATED SAMPLES FROM OUR MURI TEAM MEMBER (PROF. JAYICH), WE WILL EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALIZATION IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE OF DIPOLAR SPINS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO GENERALIZE TRANSITION EDGE SENSING FOR USE IN A RYDBERG TWEEZER ARRAY.
 YEAR 4: WE WILL DEMONSTRATE CONTROL OF DISORDER, HAMILTONIAN INTERACTIONS, AND SPIN DENSITY IN AN NV-P1 SYSTEM BY USING A COMBINATION OF PULSED DRIVING PROTOCOLS AND EXTERNAL FIELD TUNING. WE WILL PERFORM EXTENSIVE NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION TO FIND A SUITABLE PARAMETER REGIME FOR REALIZING DIPOLAR SPIN SQUEEZING.
 YEAR 5: BUILDING UPON THE TOOLS DEVELOPED IN YEARS 3-4, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE SPIN SQUEEZING IN A CENTRAL SPIN NV MODEL. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE PULSED DRIVING PROTOCOLS TO DEMONSTRATE AC MAGNETOMETRY IN OUR COUPLED NV-P1 SYSTEM WHICH EXHIBITS AN ENHANCED SENSING BANDWIDTH WITH NO LOSS IN SENSITIVITY.

 THIS GLARING TECHNOLOGY GAP OF HIGH PRIORITY TO DOD, WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A NOVEL SEMISYNTHETIC HYALURONIC ACID-BASED (HYA) HYDROGEL, CALLED VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢.
 IN THIS PROPOSAL, PROF. HEALYÂ  S LAB AT THE UC BERKELEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AIM 1, TO COMPLETE
 THE GMP MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SCALE-UP FOR VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ USE IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND AN
 FDA-REGULATED CLINICAL TRIAL. THE FIRST PILOT NON-GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (GMP)
 MANUFACTURED BATCH WILL BE PRODUCED IN GMP-LIKE CONDITIONS (AKA, GMP LITE); THIS WILL BE
 COMPLETED IN BOTH GEL AND SPONGE FORM FACTORS, STERILIZED, AND VALIDATED PHYSIOCHEMICALLY AND
 BIOLOGICALLY. PROFESSOR HEALY HAS IDENTIFIED A SITE FOR THIS WORK. ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR FOOD &
 DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) SUBMISSION WILL BE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED. ACCELERATED AND NORMAL
 STABILITY TESTING PROTOCOLS WILL BE DEVELOPED, INITIATED, AND MONITORED WITH VALIDATED METHODS. FOR
 LATE-STAGE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL USE, CGMP MATERIALS WILL BE PRODUCED AND ANALYZED UNDER GOOD
 LABORATORY PRACTICE (GLP) REGULATIONS. THE DELIVERABLE OF THIS AIM WILL BE SCALABLE GMP
 MANUFACTURING OF VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ FOR CLINICAL TRIALS. WE FULLY EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT AND VALIDATE THE
 GMP MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ AND MAKE IT READILY AVAILABLE FOR THE PROPOSED
 PRECLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES BY Q3/4 OF YEAR 1. NONETHELESS, THE GMP MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES WILL
 NEED TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE 3-YEAR COURSE OF THE PROPOSED WORK TO ENSURE READY AVAILABILITY
 FOR ALL REQUIRED PRECLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PLANNED TO SCALE-UP THE
 VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ SPONGE FORM FACTOR MANUFACTURING FOR USE IN REGULATED HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES
 FOLLOWING FDA GUIDANCE AND ULTIMATELY CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL.
 PROF. HEALYÂ  S LAB WILL PREPARE AND PROVIDE TWO FORMS OF HYA BIOMATERIALS TO PROF. CHRIST (A
 LYOPHILIZED SPONGE AND GEL). THESE WILL BE IMPLANTED IN A MURINE VML MODEL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
 VIRGINIA AND COMPARED WITH THE ALREADY TESTED HYA HYDROGEL FORMULATION. A LYOPHILIZED SPONGE
 FORM WOULD BE EASIER TO STERILIZE, EASIER TO IMPLANT, AND TAKE LESS OPERATING ROOM TIME FOR CLINICIANS
 TO APPLY THAN AN IN SITU FORMING GEL SOLUTION. THUS, THIS STUDY IS CRITICAL TO MOVING THE PROJECT
 CLOSER TO THE CLINIC IN A SHORTER TIME.
 THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS.
 SHOULD ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS RESULT FROM THIS WORK THEY WILL HAVE BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY
 APPLICATIONS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W81XWH2220013_2100/,2024-03-12 12:03:13+00

 OBJECTIVE: EXTRACT TASK-ENVIRONMENT-BODY (TEB) REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STRATEGY SUITE ANIMALS
 USE TO MAP AND MANEUVER WITHIN THEIR UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS BY USING NEUROMECHANICALLY
 INSTRUMENTED ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH RODENTS RESPOND TO A HIGHLY CHALLENGING, COMPLEX,
 EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULABLE TERRAIN-SENSORIUM.

 DIVERSITY OF LENGTH AND TIME SCALES OVER WHICH FIT SPECIES PURSUE SURVIVAL TASKS. ANIMAL
 MORPHOLOGIES SUPPORT THESE EMBODIED PROBLEM-SOLVING CAPABILITIES THROUGH HIERARCHICAL
 INFORMATION PROCESSING AUGMENTED BY STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED SENSING AND
 ACTUATION, MATERIAL PROPERTIES, AND PHYSICAL DYNAMICS. NO ENGINEERED SYSTEM HAS EVER COME CLOSE
 TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NONLINEARITY, INNOVATIVE MEMORY USE, AND SEEMING INFINITE DIMENSIONAL
 LEARNING, ADAPTATION, DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION THAT UNDERLIES SUCH EMBODIED AUTONOMY.
 WE PROPOSE A NARROW, BUT INTEGRATED FOCUS, ON KEY RANGES ALONG THIS NEWLY ACCESSIBLE,
 SWEEPING SPECTRUM OF ANIMAL LEARNING, WHEN INFORMED BY OUR TOPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRACING
 THE NATURE OF AND CONSTRAINTS ON ENERGY AND INFORMATION FLOWS, HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO BREAK OPEN
 NEW FOUNDATIONS OF MACHINE AUTONOMY. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE NEUROMECHANICS OF
 INTACT, FREE-RUNNING SPECIES (SQUIRRELS) IN ARTIFICIAL FORAGING ENVIRONMENTS WHOSE NAVIGATION
 THROUGH EXTREME MOTOR CHALLENGES (DENSELY OBSTRUCTED OR SEVERELY CRATERED PATHWAYS  THE SORT OF
 UNSTRUCTURED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CONFOUND CONTEMPORARY ROBOTICS). WE WILL
 STUDY THE HOW NOVEL AGILE MANEUVERS (E.G., SUDDEN PARKOUR GAP-CROSSING INNOVATIONS) ARISE
 ACROSS BODY TYPES (DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES IN THE SAME SPECIES) AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORIES
 (DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS WITH SIMILAR HABITAT). IN TURN, WE WILL STUDY THE HOW ANIMALS VARIED
 MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES INTERACT WITH THEIR
 NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGIES.
 WE WILL STUDY JUVENILE FOX SQUIRRELS FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, AS IN OTHER MAMMALS, TREE
 SQUIRRELS MUST DEVELOP THEIR MOTOR SKILLS IN THE COMPLEX (AND RISKY) 3D ENVIRONMENT OF THE TREE
 CANOPY. PERHAPS FOR THIS REASON, TREE SQUIRREL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SLOWER THAN
 THAT SEEN IN GROUND SQUIRRELS, SUCH AS CHIPMUNKS, WHO MOVE PRIMARILY IN 2D; TREE SQUIRRELS ALSO
 HAVE RELATIVELY LARGER BRAINS THAN GROUND SQUIRREL.
 YEAR 1-3. OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON THE FORM OF INNOVATION IN
 FOX SQUIRRELS, COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT MOTOR TASKS IN GROUPS WITH
 DIFFERENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WILL UTILIZE THREE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE
 HYBRIDS OF KNOWN INNATE MOTOR PATTERNS (LEAPING, NUT OPENING, CACHE BURYING). BECAUSE THE
 INNATE COMPONENTS OF THESE BEHAVIORS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED, WE CAN PRECISELY IDENTIFY THE NOVEL,
 LEARNED COMPONENTS. SECOND, THESE THREE BEHAVIORS OCCUR AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES AND HENCE

 USE TO MAP AND MANEUVER WITHIN THEIR UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS BY USING NEUROMECHANICALLY
 INSTRUMENTED ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH RODENTS RESPOND TO A HIGHLY CHALLENGING, COMPLEX,
 EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULABLE TERRAIN-SENSORIUM.
 APPROACH: FORAGING, AN ANIMALS KEY COGNITIVE NEUROMECHANICAL BEHAVIORAL SUITE, ILLUSTRATES THE
 DIVERSITY OF LENGTH AND TIME SCALES OVER WHICH FIT SPECIES PURSUE SURVIVAL TASKS. ANIMAL
 MORPHOLOGIES SUPPORT THESE EMBODIED PROBLEM-SOLVING CAPABILITIES THROUGH HIERARCHICAL
 INFORMATION PROCESSING AUGMENTED BY STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED SENSING AND
 ACTUATION, MATERIAL PROPERTIES, AND PHYSICAL DYNAMICS. NO ENGINEERED SYSTEM HAS EVER COME CLOSE
 TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NONLINEARITY, INNOVATIVE MEMORY USE, AND SEEMING INFINITE DIMENSIONAL
 LEARNING, ADAPTATION, DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION THAT UNDERLIES SUCH EMBODIED AUTONOMY.

 SWEEPING SPECTRUM OF ANIMAL LEARNING, WHEN INFORMED BY OUR TOPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRACING
 THE NATURE OF AND CONSTRAINTS ON ENERGY AND INFORMATION FLOWS, HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO BREAK OPEN
 NEW FOUNDATIONS OF MACHINE AUTONOMY. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE NEUROMECHANICS OF
 INTACT, FREE-RUNNING SPECIES (SQUIRRELS) IN ARTIFICIAL FORAGING ENVIRONMENTS WHOSE NAVIGATION
 THROUGH EXTREME MOTOR CHALLENGES (DENSELY OBSTRUCTED OR SEVERELY CRATERED PATHWAYS  THE SORT OF
 UNSTRUCTURED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CONFOUND CONTEMPORARY ROBOTICS). WE WILL
 STUDY THE HOW NOVEL AGILE MANEUVERS (E.G., SUDDEN PARKOUR GAP-CROSSING INNOVATIONS) ARISE
 ACROSS BODY TYPES (DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES IN THE SAME SPECIES) AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORIES
 (DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS WITH SIMILAR HABITAT). IN TURN, WE WILL STUDY THE HOW ANIMALS VARIED
 MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES INTERACT WITH THEIR
 NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGIES.
 WE WILL STUDY JUVENILE FOX SQUIRRELS FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, AS IN OTHER MAMMALS, TREE
 SQUIRRELS MUST DEVELOP THEIR MOTOR SKILLS IN THE COMPLEX (AND RISKY) 3D ENVIRONMENT OF THE TREE
 CANOPY. PERHAPS FOR THIS REASON, TREE SQUIRREL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SLOWER THAN
 THAT SEEN IN GROUND SQUIRRELS, SUCH AS CHIPMUNKS, WHO MOVE PRIMARILY IN 2D; TREE SQUIRRELS ALSO
 HAVE RELATIVELY LARGER BRAINS THAN GROUND SQUIRREL.

 FOX SQUIRRELS, COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT MOTOR TASKS IN GROUPS WITH
 DIFFERENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WILL UTILIZE THREE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE
 HYBRIDS OF KNOWN INNATE MOTOR PATTERNS (LEAPING, NUT OPENING, CACHE BURYING). BECAUSE THE

THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ANY
 DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS. SHOULD ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS RESULT FROM THIS WORK, THEY WILL HAVE BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY APPLICATIONS.
 RA 1.1: HIERARCHICAL AND COMPOSABLE PERCEPTION AND LEARNING
 THIS TASK WILL FOCUS ON DESIGNING LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT ARE MODULAR AND COMPOSABLE. WE WILL DEVELOP ANALYTIC MODULES THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO A LEARNING SYSTEM VIA A MODULAR FRAMEWORK, FORCING THE LEARNED MODULES TO ADAPT TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ANALYTIC MODULES AND THEREBY ENSURING GOOD PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THESE MODULES WOULD BE COMPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH MISSION PARAMETERS ON DEMAND, AND WOULD COOPERATE BOTH WITH OTHER MODULES WITHIN A SINGLE VEHICLE, AND ACROSS DIFFERENT VEHICLES IN SWARMS AND HUMAN-ROBOT TEAMS. OUR APPROACH WILL INCORPORATE HETEROGENEOUS AND DYNAMICALLY
 RECONFIGURABLE STRUCTURE AND BOTH LEARNED MODULES AND DIFFERENTIABLE ANALYTIC MODULES SUCH AS MOTION PLANNERS, EFFECTIVELY HYBRIDIZING LEARNING AND MODEL-BASED DECISION MAKING ON SCALES RANGING FROM
 REACTIVE CONTROL TO MISSION-LENGTH PLANNING.
 RA 3.2 DATA RESILIENT MACHINE LEARNING
 THIS TASK WILL FOCUS ON A RIGOROUS FUSION OF PROBABILISTIC GENERATIVE MODELS WITH DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND OTHER DISCRIMINATIVE MODELS. THE EXPRESSIVE POWER OF DISCRIMINATIVE MODELS COMBINED WITH PROBABILISTIC
 PRIORS FROM GENERATIVE MODELS WILL ALLOW THE SWARM TO RELY ON LEARNED MODELS IN UNEXPECTED OR EVEN ADVERSARIAL CONDITIONS WITHOUT EXHIBITING SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED PERFORMANCE OR UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR. WE
 WILL BUILD LEARNING SYSTEMS THAT ARE RESILIENT AND ROBUST TO OUT-OF-DOMAIN INPUTS, ADVERSARIAL PERTURBATION, AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES OVER TIME IN NONSTATIONARY SETTINGS. WE CAN CATEGORIZE UNEXPECTED PERTURBATIONS
 INTO THREE CATEGORIES: (1) OUT-OF-DOMAIN INPUTS THAT WERE NOT SEEN DURING TRAINING; (2) ADVERSARIAL INPUTS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO CONFUSE OR DEGRADE THE LEARNING SYSTEM; (3) SYSTEMATIC CHANGES IN THE
 ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRE EXPLICIT ADAPTATION (AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLE DISTURBANCE REJECTION). WE WILL ADDRESS (1) THROUGH THE USE OF PROBABILISTIC MODELS THAT ESTIMATE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE LEARNED MODEL.

THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ANY
 DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS. SHOULD ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS RESULT FROM THIS WORK, THEY WILL HAVE BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY APPLICATIONS.
 RA 1.1: HIERARCHICAL AND COMPOSABLE PERCEPTION AND LEARNING
 THIS TASK WILL FOCUS ON DESIGNING LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT ARE MODULAR AND COMPOSABLE. WE WILL DEVELOP ANALYTIC MODULES THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO A LEARNING SYSTEM VIA A MODULAR FRAMEWORK, FORCING THE LEARNED MODULES TO ADAPT TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ANALYTIC MODULES AND THEREBY ENSURING GOOD PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THESE MODULES WOULD BE COMPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH MISSION PARAMETERS ON DEMAND, AND WOULD COOPERATE BOTH WITH OTHER MODULES WITHIN A SINGLE VEHICLE, AND ACROSS DIFFERENT VEHICLES IN SWARMS AND HUMAN-ROBOT TEAMS. OUR APPROACH WILL INCORPORATE HETEROGENEOUS AND DYNAMICALLY
 RECONFIGURABLE STRUCTURE AND BOTH LEARNED MODULES AND DIFFERENTIABLE ANALYTIC MODULES SUCH AS MOTION PLANNERS, EFFECTIVELY HYBRIDIZING LEARNING AND MODEL-BASED DECISION MAKING ON SCALES RANGING FROM
 REACTIVE CONTROL TO MISSION-LENGTH PLANNING.
 RA 3.2 DATA RESILIENT MACHINE LEARNING
 THIS TASK WILL FOCUS ON A RIGOROUS FUSION OF PROBABILISTIC GENERATIVE MODELS WITH DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND OTHER DISCRIMINATIVE MODELS. THE EXPRESSIVE POWER OF DISCRIMINATIVE MODELS COMBINED WITH PROBABILISTIC
 PRIORS FROM GENERATIVE MODELS WILL ALLOW THE SWARM TO RELY ON LEARNED MODELS IN UNEXPECTED OR EVEN ADVERSARIAL CONDITIONS WITHOUT EXHIBITING SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED PERFORMANCE OR UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR. WE
 WILL BUILD LEARNING SYSTEMS THAT ARE RESILIENT AND ROBUST TO OUT-OF-DOMAIN INPUTS, ADVERSARIAL PERTURBATION, AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES OVER TIME IN NONSTATIONARY SETTINGS. WE CAN CATEGORIZE UNEXPECTED PERTURBATIONS
 INTO THREE CATEGORIES: (1) OUT-OF-DOMAIN INPUTS THAT WERE NOT SEEN DURING TRAINING; (2) ADVERSARIAL INPUTS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO CONFUSE OR DEGRADE THE LEARNING SYSTEM; (3) SYSTEMATIC CHANGES IN THE
 ENVIRONMENT THAT REQUIRE EXPLICIT ADAPTATION (AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLE DISTURBANCE REJECTION). WE WILL ADDRESS (1) THROUGH THE USE OF PROBABILISTIC MODELS THAT ESTIMATE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE LEARNED MODEL.
 WE WILL ADDRESS (2) THROUGH ADVERSARIAL TRAINING, INCLUDING NOVEL ADVERSARIAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TECHNIQUES. TO ADDRESS (3), WE WILL DEVELOP FAST ADAPTATION TECHNIQUES FOR AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR BASED
 ON META-LEARNING.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W911NF1720181_2100/,2023-07-28 14:55:53+00

 TIMELINE: TOTAL: 30 MONTHS, ANIMAL STUDIES BEGIN 18 MONTHS
 SUBTASKS:
 1.IN PREPARATION FOR THE ANIMAL STUDIES IN AIM 1, WE WILL DEVELOP THE NECESSARY SOFTWARE TO PROCESS NEW SENSOR MEASUREMENTS (NIRS, ETCO2, VF WAVEFORM)
 2.CURRENTLY ONLY INCREMENTAL LINEAR REGRESSION, ECHO STATE NEURAL STATE NEURAL NETWORKS, AND INCREMENTAL SPARSE GAUSSIAN PROCESSES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ONLINE. NEW ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND MULTI-HORIZON QUANTILE NETWORKS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN OUR EXPERIMENTAL SETUP SO THAT PREDICTION CAN OCCUR DURING EACH ANIMAL STUDY.
 3.NEW DATA MUST BE INTEGRATED AND CURATED INTO THE EXISTING HISTORICAL DATASET. GIVEN THE REALITIES OF SENSOR AND HARDWARE FAILURES IN REAL WORLD EXPERIMENTS, AS WELL AS LACK OF SPECIFIC SENSOR DATA IN HISTORICAL DATA, IMPLEMENTATION OF METHODS TO DEAL WITH MISSING/INCOMPLETE DATASETS WILL BE NECESSARY.
 4.AFTER EACH WEEK OF EXPERIMENTS, PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS CAN BE RETRAINED, ADJUSTED, AND TUNED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (1 YEAR)
 AIM 2: PAIR CONTROL AND PREDICTION
 TIMELINE: MONTH 8 TO MONTH 48, ANIMAL STUDIES START MONTH 32
 SUBTASKS:
 GIVEN THE BASELINE INTEGRAL LQR CONTROL WE HAVE NOW, THERE ARE A FEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXPLORATION. 
 1.ADDITIONAL MODELS ARE NONLINEAR REPRESENTATIONS OF CPR DYNAMICS MUST BE LINEARIZED TO BE APPLIED WITH THE INTEGRAL LQR CONTROLLER. THIS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN SOFTWARE, ADDITIONALLY, THE LQR REPRESENTATION MUST BE COMPUTABLE IN AN ONLINE FASHION, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT APERIODIC IMPLEMENTATION.
 2.HUMAN OPERATION OF THE MACHINE CONTROLLED CPR COMES IN THE FORM OF CHOOSING THE TARGET CPP AND CONTROLLER WEIGHTS Q AND R. THE DYNAMICS OF CPP DECOMPENSATION AND CAN BE LEARNED ONLINE. Q AND R CAN BE CHOSEN BASED ON PERFORMANCE MARGINS OF THE CONTROLLER.
 3.THE MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL SCHEME CAN TAKE FORM MULTIPLE VARIATIONS, PARTICULARLY IF THE COST FUNCTION DESIGN IS NON-SMOOTH. WE SHOULD ATTEMPT CONVEX OPTIMIZATION BASED MPC, MPC-DDP, AND MPPI AS THE CONTROLLER. THE CHOICE OF MPC CONTROL DEPENDS HIGHLY ON THE MODEL PERFORMANCE IN AIM 1.
 4.ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CONTROL INCLUDE APPLYING AN ADAPTIVE CONTROL SCHEME COUPLED WITH AN MPC CONTROLLER. IN THIS CASE, THE REFERENCE MODEL IS GIVEN BY OUR PREDICTIVE MODEL, AND THE MPC CONTROLLER OUTPUTS A POLICY WHICH IS ADAPTED IN REAL TIME BY THE ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER TO FORCE THE TRUE MODEL AND REFERENCE MODEL TO MATCH.
 5.IN THE CASE OF UTILIZING A PREDICTION FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES UNCERTAINTY (SPARSE SPECTRUM GAUSSIAN PROCESSES, NEURAL NETWORKS APPROXIMATING BAYES NETS WITH DROPOUT, QUANTILE REGRESSION), IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO UTILIZE CONTROL SCHEMES THAT ARE AWARE OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL, AND CAN TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.
 6.UNCERTAINTY AWARE CONTROL SPANS BOTH DETERMINISTIC INTERPRETATIONS (CONTROL BARRIER FUNCTIONS, CONTROL CONTRACTION METRICS) AND PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATIONS (CVAR BASED OPTIMIZATION, CHANCE CONSTRAINED CONTROLLERS, BELIEF SPACE CONTROLLERS)
 AIM 3: INVESTIGATE NON-INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENTS AS A SURROGATE FOR INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT
 TIMELINE: MONTH 18 TO MONTH 60
 THIS IS SOLVING AN ESTIMATION PROBLEM WITH AN UNKNOWN MEASUREMENT MODEL TO OUR INVASIVELY MEASURED STATES, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY UNMODELED LATENT STATES.
 1.NON-INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT SUCH AS VF WAVEFORMS RESPIRATIONS HAVE SIGNALS THAT ARE UNCORRELATED WITH HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. IN THE CASE OF VF, THE PHYSICAL COMPRESSIONS OF THE CHEST WILL CAUSE A SIGNAL OF EQUAL FREQUENCY TO APPEAR INTO THE VF WAVEFORM. FOR ETCO2, THE NATURAL RESPIRATIONS OF THE ANIMAL LIMIT THE FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT, AND THE MEASUREMENT OFTEN HAS A PHASE LAG BETWEEN MEASUREMENT AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. SIMILAR ISSUES ARE PRESENT FOR METABOLIC MARKERS, LEADING TO A NECESSARY INVESTIGATION OF EXISTING METHODS OF DATA FILTERING, AND TIME DELAYED MEASUREMENT MODELS.

 1.IN PREPARATION FOR THE ANIMAL STUDIES IN AIM 1, WE WILL DEVELOP THE NECESSARY SOFTWARE TO PROCESS NEW SENSOR MEASUREMENTS (NIRS, ETCO2, VF WAVEFORM)
 2.CURRENTLY ONLY INCREMENTAL LINEAR REGRESSION, ECHO STATE NEURAL STATE NEURAL NETWORKS, AND INCREMENTAL SPARSE GAUSSIAN PROCESSES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ONLINE. NEW ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND MULTI-HORIZON QUANTILE NETWORKS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN OUR EXPERIMENTAL SETUP SO THAT PREDICTION CAN OCCUR DURING EACH ANIMAL STUDY.
 3.NEW DATA MUST BE INTEGRATED AND CURATED INTO THE EXISTING HISTORICAL DATASET. GIVEN THE REALITIES OF SENSOR AND HARDWARE FAILURES IN REAL WORLD EXPERIMENTS, AS WELL AS LACK OF SPECIFIC SENSOR DATA IN HISTORICAL DATA, IMPLEMENTATION OF METHODS TO DEAL WITH MISSING/INCOMPLETE DATASETS WILL BE NECESSARY.
 4.AFTER EACH WEEK OF EXPERIMENTS, PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS CAN BE RETRAINED, ADJUSTED, AND TUNED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (1 YEAR)
 AIM 2: PAIR CONTROL AND PREDICTION
 TIMELINE: MONTH 8 TO MONTH 48, ANIMAL STUDIES START MONTH 32
 SUBTASKS:
 GIVEN THE BASELINE INTEGRAL LQR CONTROL WE HAVE NOW, THERE ARE A FEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXPLORATION. 
 1.ADDITIONAL MODELS ARE NONLINEAR REPRESENTATIONS OF CPR DYNAMICS MUST BE LINEARIZED TO BE APPLIED WITH THE INTEGRAL LQR CONTROLLER. THIS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN SOFTWARE, ADDITIONALLY, THE LQR REPRESENTATION MUST BE COMPUTABLE IN AN ONLINE FASHION, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT APERIODIC IMPLEMENTATION.
 2.HUMAN OPERATION OF THE MACHINE CONTROLLED CPR COMES IN THE FORM OF CHOOSING THE TARGET CPP AND CONTROLLER WEIGHTS Q AND R. THE DYNAMICS OF CPP DECOMPENSATION AND CAN BE LEARNED ONLINE. Q AND R CAN BE CHOSEN BASED ON PERFORMANCE MARGINS OF THE CONTROLLER.
 3.THE MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL SCHEME CAN TAKE FORM MULTIPLE VARIATIONS, PARTICULARLY IF THE COST FUNCTION DESIGN IS NON-SMOOTH. WE SHOULD ATTEMPT CONVEX OPTIMIZATION BASED MPC, MPC-DDP, AND MPPI AS THE CONTROLLER. THE CHOICE OF MPC CONTROL DEPENDS HIGHLY ON THE MODEL PERFORMANCE IN AIM 1.
 4.ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO CONTROL INCLUDE APPLYING AN ADAPTIVE CONTROL SCHEME COUPLED WITH AN MPC CONTROLLER. IN THIS CASE, THE REFERENCE MODEL IS GIVEN BY OUR PREDICTIVE MODEL, AND THE MPC CONTROLLER OUTPUTS A POLICY WHICH IS ADAPTED IN REAL TIME BY THE ADAPTIVE CONTROLLER TO FORCE THE TRUE MODEL AND REFERENCE MODEL TO MATCH.
 5.IN THE CASE OF UTILIZING A PREDICTION FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES UNCERTAINTY (SPARSE SPECTRUM GAUSSIAN PROCESSES, NEURAL NETWORKS APPROXIMATING BAYES NETS WITH DROPOUT, QUANTILE REGRESSION), IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO UTILIZE CONTROL SCHEMES THAT ARE AWARE OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL, AND CAN TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT.
 6.UNCERTAINTY AWARE CONTROL SPANS BOTH DETERMINISTIC INTERPRETATIONS (CONTROL BARRIER FUNCTIONS, CONTROL CONTRACTION METRICS) AND PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATIONS (CVAR BASED OPTIMIZATION, CHANCE CONSTRAINED CONTROLLERS, BELIEF SPACE CONTROLLERS)
 AIM 3: INVESTIGATE NON-INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENTS AS A SURROGATE FOR INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT
 TIMELINE: MONTH 18 TO MONTH 60
 THIS IS SOLVING AN ESTIMATION PROBLEM WITH AN UNKNOWN MEASUREMENT MODEL TO OUR INVASIVELY MEASURED STATES, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY UNMODELED LATENT STATES.
 1.NON-INVASIVE FORMS OF MEASUREMENT SUCH AS VF WAVEFORMS RESPIRATIONS HAVE SIGNALS THAT ARE UNCORRELATED WITH HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. IN THE CASE OF VF, THE PHYSICAL COMPRESSIONS OF THE CHEST WILL CAUSE A SIGNAL OF EQUAL FREQUENCY TO APPEAR INTO THE VF WAVEFORM. FOR ETCO2, THE NATURAL RESPIRATIONS OF THE ANIMAL LIMIT THE FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT, AND THE MEASUREMENT OFTEN HAS A PHASE LAG BETWEEN MEASUREMENT AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. SIMILAR ISSUES ARE PRESENT FOR METABOLIC MARKERS, LEADING TO A NECESSARY INVESTIGATION OF EXISTING METHODS OF DATA FILTERING, AND TIME DELAYED MEASUREMENT MODELS.

THE PROPOSED WORK WILL SUPPORT ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AND THE NANOFABRICATION FEES FOR QUANTUM ELECTROMECHANICAL DEVICE DEVELOPMENT. THE UC BERKELEY RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON CO-DESIGNING ELECTROMAGNETIC AND PHONONIC CIRCUITS TO REALIZE COMPACT (MICROMETER-SCALE) SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH COHERENCE. ACHIEVING BOTH OF THESE SIMULTANEOUSLY HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING CHALLENGE AND IS NEEDED FOR SCALING QUANTUM PROCESSORS. OUR APPROACH WILL USE PHONONIC ENGINEERING TO BREAK EXISTING TRADEOFFS IN SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSORS. WE WILL ALSO COLLABORATE WITH THE TEAM MEMBERS ON DEVELOPING NEW MATERIALS AND DEVICE PLATFORMS FOR HIGHLY COHERENT ELECTROMECHANICAL QUANTUM CIRCUITS AND HIGH-COOPERATIVITY SPINPHONON INTERFACES.
 
 CURRENT SUPERCONDUCTING CIRCUITS USE LARGE-FOOTPRINT CAPACITORS TO MINIMIZE SURFACE PARTICIPATION THAT LEADS TO HIGH LOSSES DUE TO TWO-LEVEL DEFECTS IN MATERIALS. THIS LOSS MECHANISM LEADS TO DISSIPATION VIA PHONON EMISSION TO THE BULK OF THE SUBSTRATE, AND LIMITS QUANTUM PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE. USING COMPACT QUBIT DESIGNS (SUCH AS SMALL GAP PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITORS) CAN REDUCE QUBIT DIMENSIONS FOR IMPROVED SCALING, BUT ALSO RESULTS IN INCREASED LOSSES DUE TO PHONON RADIATION. TO BREAK THIS LONG-STANDING TRADEOFF IN SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS, WE WILL CO-DESIGN ELECTROMAGNETIC AND PHONONIC BATHS OF THE QUBITS. WE WILL DEVELOP MICROMETER SCALE SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS ON PHONONIC METAMATERIALS WHERE PHONON RADIATION IS FORBIDDEN. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL ENGINEER SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS BASED ON THIN-FILM PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITORS THAT ARE FABRICATED ON PHONONIC BANDGAP MATERIALS. THE FABRICATION PROCESS WILL BUILD ON OUR RECENTLY DEVELOPED PROCESS FOR MAKING (LARGE, PLANAR) QUBITS ON PHONONIC METAMATERIALS. THE INITIAL WORK WILL FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING HOW CONTROLLING THE PHONON DENSITY OF STATES USING METAMATERIALS IMPROVES
 TWO-LEVEL SYSTEM DEFECT AND SUPERCONDUCTING QUBIT LIFETIMES. WE WILL USE QUANTUM LOGIC SPECTROSCOPY FOR CHARACTERIZATING THE QUBIT-DEFECT SYSTEM ON PHONONIC METAMATERIALS. WE WILL THEN USE THESE RESULTS TO DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZE PHONON ENGINEERED SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS WITH MICROMETER FOOTPRINT. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED IN A DILUTION REFRIGERATOR SYSTEM AND USING MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPED AT PI SIPAHIGILÂ  S LAB.
 
 MILESTONES FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK UC BERKELEY WILL INCLUDE: (1) PROCESS DEVELOPMENT FOR COMPACT, PARALLEL PLATE SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS ON GHZ PHONONIC METAMATERIALS, (2) QUANTUM LOGIC SPECTROSCOPY OF PHONON-ENGINEERED MATERIAL DEFECTS WITH ENHANCED T1 TIMES, MATERIAL AND PROCESS OPTIMIZATION, (3) COMPACT SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS WITH LONG LIFETIMES VIA PHONON ENGINEERING, (4) QUBIT DEVICE SCALING, UNDERSTAND FOOTPRINT-LIFETIME-COHERENCE TRADEOFFS, (5) OPTIMIZATION AND DECOUPLING PROTOCOLS FOR ENHANCED COHERENCE IN MICROMETER SCALE SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS VIA PHONONIC ENGINEERING.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_FA95502310333_5700/,2023-09-12 22:25:39+00

 CRITICAL FACTORS NEEDED IN ROBOTIC ACTUATORS. DESPITE THE PRESSING NEED FOR ACTUATORS THAT EXHIBIT ALL
 OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS, SYNTHETIC ACTUATORS DEVELOPED TO DATE TEND TO EXCEL ONLY IN A FEW OF THESE
 CATEGORIES WHILE SEVERELY LACKING IN OTHERS. IN CONTRAST, BIOLOGICAL MUSCLE EXHIBITS ALL OF THESE
 CHARACTERISTICS, AND ANIMALS DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF MUSCLE AS AN ACTUATOR FOR AGILE, NIMBLE, AND
 ADAPTABLE PERFORMANCE. THE EMERGING FIELD OF BIOHYBRID ROBOTICS SHOWS THAT RECENT ADVANCES IN
 TISSUE ENGINEERING CAN BE HARNESSED TO INTEGRATE LIVING MUSCLES IN RELATIVELY SIMPLE DEVICES.
 HOWEVER, SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES REMAIN THAT LIMIT THE SCALABILITY, LONGEVITY, CONTROL, AND
 POWER OF THESE EXISTING BIOACTUATORS. IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES HAVE
 CO-EVOLVED WITHIN THE NEUROMUSCULAR AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEMS. OUR TEAMÂ  S WORK HAS SHOWN
 THAT BIOACTUATOR PERFORMANCE IS IMPROVED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF NEURAL CONTROL CIRCUITRY, AND
 BIOACTUATOR FORCE CAN BE ENHANCED BY ALLOWING MUSCLE SELF-EXERCISE. HOWEVER, BIOHYBRID ACTUATORS
 STUDIES TO DATE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE ACTUATORS IN HIGHLY CONTROLLED LABORATORY
 SETTINGS IN WHICH ACTUATORS ARE CARED FOR DAILY TO REMOVE WASTE PRODUCTS, REPLENISH NUTRIENTS, AND
 TYPICALLY REQUIRE LARGE OFFBOARD SYSTEMS FOR STIMULATION. EVEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, EXISTING
 BIOHYBRID ACTUATORS FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE FORCE AND LONGEVITY CAPABILITIES OF IN SITU MUSCLE IN LIVING
 ORGANISMS. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THAT AN INTEGRATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH EFFORT IS NEEDED TO
 UNDERSTAND BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR INTERFACES, LIFE-SUPPORT, DESIGN, AND LOCAL CONTROL TO MOVE BIOHYBRID
 ACTUATORS BEYOND THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PETRI DISH SCALE. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF 3D
 SYNTHETIC SCAFFOLDS, LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS, ELECTRO-, AND PHOTO-NEUROMUSCULAR INTERFACES, AND LOCAL
 FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS ON BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR PERFORMANCE, ADAPTABILITY, AND LONGEVITY.
 FURTHERMORE, WE WILL VALIDATE OUR UNDERSTANDING BY INTEGRATING GENERAL PRINCIPLES FROM OUR BASIC
 RESEARCH IN BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR FABRICATION, MATURATION, INTERFACES, AND LIFE SUPPORT, WITH
 COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS DESIGN. USING THESE TOOLS, WE WILL TEST OUR UNDERSTANDING BY PREDICTING AND

 STAMPER-KURN GROUP DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
 
 THIS MURI PROJECT WILL SUPPORT ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AND ONE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER WORKING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR DAN STAMPER-KURN. THE PROJECT PERSONNEL WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH ON QUANTUM ENHANCED METROLOGY REALIZED WITH ENSEMBLES OF ULTRACOLD ATOMS TRAPPED WITHIN AND INTERROGATED VIA A HIGH FINESSE OPTICAL RESONATOR. THIS WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MURI RESEARCH TEAM. SPECIFIC WORK TO BE CONDUCTED AND YEARLY OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
 YEAR 1: DISSIPATIVE PREPARATION OF ENTANGLED STATE OF SPIN ENSEMBLE IN THE RESOLVED- SIDEBAND REGIME.
 
 YEAR 2: DISSIPATIVE PREPARATION OF ENTANGLED STATES OF MECHANICAL MOTION IN THE UNRESOLVED SIDEBAND REGIME, AND DEMONSTRATION OF QUANTUM ENHANCED METROLOGY OF MAGNETIC FIELD AND OF FORCES USING DISSIPATIVELY PREPARED SQUEEZED STATES.
 
 YEAR 3: DEMONSTRATION OF BACKACTION EVADING FORCE SENSING USING THE ATOMIC MOTION OF SEVERAL ATOMIC ENSEMBLES WITHIN AN OPTICAL SUPERLATTICE.
 
 YEAR 4: GENERATION OF TWO-MODE SQUEEZING WITHIN AN ARRAY OF ATOMIC ENSEMBLES, DEMONSTRATED FOR BOTH SPIN AND MECHANICAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM.
 
 YEAR 5: DEMONSTRATION OF QUANTUM ENHANCED MAGNETIC-FIELD DIFFERENCE SENSING THROUGH USE OF TWO-MODE SQUEEZING OF SPIN ENSEMBLES.

 THIS MURI PROJECT WILL SUPPORT ONE GRADUATE STUDENT WORKING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR NORMAN YAO, WHO WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH ON USING DIPOLAR INTERACTIONS TO REALIZE SPIN SQUEEZING IN A CENTRAL SPIN MODEL AS WELL AS A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR WHO WILL FOCUS ON EXPLORING NEW TECHNIQUES FOR ENHANCED METROLOGY BASED ON MANY-BODY CRITICAL POINTS. THIS
 
  
 
 WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MURI RESEARCH TEAM. SPECIFIC WORK TO BE CONDUCTED AND YEARLY MILESTONES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 YEAR 1: WE WILL DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO UTILIZE A COMBINATION OF DRIVING AND DIPOLAR INTERACTIONS TO REALIZE SPIN SQUEEZING. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT GROUND STATES OF CERTAIN LONG-RANGE INTERACTING SPIN MODELS CAN HARBOR METROLOGICALLY USEFUL ENTANGLEMENT AS MEASURED BY THE QUANTUM FISHER INFORMATION.
 YEAR 2: USING A THREE-DIMENSIONAL CENTRAL SPIN MODEL BASED UPON NV CENTERS AND P1 CENTERS IN DIAMOND, WE WILL EXPLORE THE DYNAMICS OF ENTANGLEMENT AND ATTEMPT TO MEASURE THE EMERGENT DIFFUSION CONSTANT IN A DISORDERED DIPOLAR SPIN ENSEMBLE.
 YEAR 3: USING SPECIALLY FABRICATED SAMPLES FROM OUR MURI TEAM MEMBER (PROF. JAYICH), WE WILL EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALIZATION IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE OF DIPOLAR SPINS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO GENERALIZE TRANSITION EDGE SENSING FOR USE IN A RYDBERG TWEEZER ARRAY.
 YEAR 4: WE WILL DEMONSTRATE CONTROL OF DISORDER, HAMILTONIAN INTERACTIONS, AND SPIN DENSITY IN AN NV-P1 SYSTEM BY USING A COMBINATION OF PULSED DRIVING PROTOCOLS AND EXTERNAL FIELD TUNING. WE WILL PERFORM EXTENSIVE NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION TO FIND A SUITABLE PARAMETER REGIME FOR REALIZING DIPOLAR SPIN SQUEEZING.
 YEAR 5: BUILDING UPON THE TOOLS DEVELOPED IN YEARS 3-4, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE SPIN SQUEEZING IN A CENTRAL SPIN NV MODEL. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE PULSED DRIVING PROTOCOLS TO DEMONSTRATE AC MAGNETOMETRY IN OUR COUPLED NV-P1 SYSTEM WHICH EXHIBITS AN ENHANCED SENSING BANDWIDTH WITH NO LOSS IN SENSITIVITY.

 MANEUVERS IN UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS. THE RESEARCH AT BERKELEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE
 FOLLOWING MAJOR TASK OF THE PROPOSAL.
 RCA 2: DISCOVER INNOVATION/LEARNING STRATEGIES IN ANIMALS.
 OBJECTIVE: EXTRACT TASK-ENVIRONMENT-BODY (TEB) REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STRATEGY SUITE ANIMALS
 USE TO MAP AND MANEUVER WITHIN THEIR UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS BY USING NEUROMECHANICALLY
 INSTRUMENTED ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH RODENTS RESPOND TO A HIGHLY CHALLENGING, COMPLEX,
 EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULABLE TERRAIN-SENSORIUM.
 APPROACH: FORAGING, AN ANIMALS KEY COGNITIVE NEUROMECHANICAL BEHAVIORAL SUITE, ILLUSTRATES THE
 DIVERSITY OF LENGTH AND TIME SCALES OVER WHICH FIT SPECIES PURSUE SURVIVAL TASKS. ANIMAL
 MORPHOLOGIES SUPPORT THESE EMBODIED PROBLEM-SOLVING CAPABILITIES THROUGH HIERARCHICAL
 INFORMATION PROCESSING AUGMENTED BY STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED SENSING AND
 ACTUATION, MATERIAL PROPERTIES, AND PHYSICAL DYNAMICS. NO ENGINEERED SYSTEM HAS EVER COME CLOSE
 TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NONLINEARITY, INNOVATIVE MEMORY USE, AND SEEMING INFINITE DIMENSIONAL
 LEARNING, ADAPTATION, DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION THAT UNDERLIES SUCH EMBODIED AUTONOMY.
 WE PROPOSE A NARROW, BUT INTEGRATED FOCUS, ON KEY RANGES ALONG THIS NEWLY ACCESSIBLE,
 SWEEPING SPECTRUM OF ANIMAL LEARNING, WHEN INFORMED BY OUR TOPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRACING
 THE NATURE OF AND CONSTRAINTS ON ENERGY AND INFORMATION FLOWS, HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO BREAK OPEN
 NEW FOUNDATIONS OF MACHINE AUTONOMY. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE NEUROMECHANICS OF
 INTACT, FREE-RUNNING SPECIES (SQUIRRELS) IN ARTIFICIAL FORAGING ENVIRONMENTS WHOSE NAVIGATION
 THROUGH EXTREME MOTOR CHALLENGES (DENSELY OBSTRUCTED OR SEVERELY CRATERED PATHWAYS  THE SORT OF
 UNSTRUCTURED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CONFOUND CONTEMPORARY ROBOTICS). WE WILL
 STUDY THE HOW NOVEL AGILE MANEUVERS (E.G., SUDDEN PARKOUR GAP-CROSSING INNOVATIONS) ARISE
 ACROSS BODY TYPES (DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES IN THE SAME SPECIES) AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORIES
 (DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS WITH SIMILAR HABITAT). IN TURN, WE WILL STUDY THE HOW ANIMALS VARIED
 MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES INTERACT WITH THEIR
 NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGIES.
 WE WILL STUDY JUVENILE FOX SQUIRRELS FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, AS IN OTHER MAMMALS, TREE
 SQUIRRELS MUST DEVELOP THEIR MOTOR SKILLS IN THE COMPLEX (AND RISKY) 3D ENVIRONMENT OF THE TREE
 CANOPY. PERHAPS FOR THIS REASON, TREE SQUIRREL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SLOWER THAN
 THAT SEEN IN GROUND SQUIRRELS, SUCH AS CHIPMUNKS, WHO MOVE PRIMARILY IN 2D; TREE SQUIRRELS ALSO
 HAVE RELATIVELY LARGER BRAINS THAN GROUND SQUIRREL.
 YEAR 1-3. OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON THE FORM OF INNOVATION IN
 FOX SQUIRRELS, COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT MOTOR TASKS IN GROUPS WITH
 DIFFERENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WILL UTILIZE THREE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE
 HYBRIDS OF KNOWN INNATE MOTOR PATTERNS (LEAPING, NUT OPENING, CACHE BURYING). BECAUSE THE
 INNATE COMPONENTS OF THESE BEHAVIORS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED, WE CAN PRECISELY IDENTIFY THE NOVEL,
 LEARNED COMPONENTS. SECOND, THESE THREE BEHAVIORS OCCUR AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES AND HENCE
 INVOLVE DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS, FROM THE SMALLEST SCALE MOVEMENTS (NUT OPENING), TO MEDIUM
 SCALE MOVEMENTS (GAP LEAPING) AND FINALLY LARGE SCALE MOVEMENTS (DISTRIBUTING CACHES). TO TEST",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W911NF1810327_2100/,2019-02-11 12:09:42+00

WE WILL INVESTIGATE FORCE MULTIPLICATION SCENARIOS IN WHICH THE SWARM SUPPORTS A TACTICAL SQUAD OF SOLDIERS BY RESPONDING TO A DISASTER OR ATTACK, ENTERING AND SEARCHING SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS OR A TOWN, INCLUDING BUILDINGS OR RUBBLE, SEARCHING THE AREA FOR IEDS AND HUMAN VICTIMS, POSSIBLY SECURING THE AREA. THIS CAN HAPPEN WITHIN A MATTER OF SEVERAL MINUTES EITHER BEFORE THE SQUAD IS ABLE TO GET TO THE SCENE, OR IN COLLABORATION WITH ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE SQUAD. WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER FORCE PROTECTION SCENARIOS IN WHICH THE SWARM FORMS A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE AROUND A SPECIAL FORCES TEAM PROVIDING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND A TACTICAL CLOUD WITHOUT EXTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE (GPS OR SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS) EVEN AS THE TEAM SPREADS OUT ACROSS A FEW CITY BLOCKS, A TOWN, OR A CITY, ANTICIPATING THE NEEDS OF THE HUMAN TEAM MEMBERS, DETECTING, LOCALIZING, AND TRACKING POTENTIAL SOURCES OF THREATS. THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO GET HETEROGENEOUS TEAMS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS TO ALLOW FOR FORCE MULTIPLICATION, THE ABILITY OF A TEAM OF AUTONOMOUS, HETEROGENEOUS MOBILE AGENTS TO GREATLY EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES AND THE REACH OF SOLDIERS, IN YET-TO-BE-IMAGINED WAYS. THEY CAN PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS LEADING TO FORCE PROTECTION, THE FORMATION OF A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE AROUND THE SOLDIERS, AGAINST DYNAMIC THREATS. FINALLY, COLLABORATIVE HETEROGENEOUS HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS CAN ACHIEVE UNPRECEDENTED OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND SUPERIORITY THROUGH FAST, INTELLIGENT AND RESILIENT BEHAVIORS.

 SENSOR MODALITIES ARE BEING EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND US INTELLIGENCE
 AGENCIES. MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOITING DATA FROM THESE NETWORKS HAS YET TO BE REALIZED, FOR
 SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, THE DATA SETS ARE OFTEN TOO LARGE AND COMPLEX TO BE ANALYZED IN REASONABLE
 TIME. SECOND, THE OVERHEAD OF SWITCHING FROM ONE ANALYSIS TASK TO ANOTHER (FOR EXAMPLE, FROM
 TRACKING TO ANOMALY DETECTION) CAN BE HIGH, IN TERMS OF INVOKING DATA TRANSFORMATION AND
 DIFFERENT ALGORITHMIC TOOLS. THIRD, THE PROCESS OF COMBINING AND TUNING MODELS AND ALGORITHMS TO
 ATTACK SUCH COMPLEX ANALYSIS TASKS AS OBJECT TRACKING IS A HIGHLY CHALLENGING ONE. WHILE SOME
 INDIVIDUAL TOOLS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD, MUCH REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED ABOUT THE CHOICE OF
 HEURISTICS AND PARAMETERS THAT ALLOW THESE TOOLS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY, AND ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO
 COMBINE DIFFERENT MODELING AND ALGORITHMIC MODALITIES.
 DATA ANALYSTS FACING THESE ROADBLOCKS MUST USE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND INTUITION TO CHOOSE
 APPROPRIATE MODELS, ALGORITHMS, AND PARAMETERS, BUT THEY MUST DEAL WITH ALGORITHMIC AND
 MODELING ISSUES THAT REQUIRE SKILLS NOT TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DATA ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT,
 END-TO-END ANALYSIS OF DATA SETS OF VARYING TYPE AND QUALITY IS DIFFICULT, TIME CONSUMING, AND
 ERROR-PRONE, EVEN FOR EXPERTS. THE ABUNDANCE OF DATA AND THE INCREASING POWER AND COMPLEXITY OF
 ANALYSIS TOOLS MAY HAVE THE PARADOXICAL EFFECT OF DECREASING THE NUMBER OF ANALYSTS THAT CAN
 DEPLOY THE TOOLS EFFECTIVELY! WE AIM TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION. OUR VISION OF AN IDEAL DATA-ANALYSIS
 SYSTEM IS ONE THAT WOULD TAKE AS INPUT THE DATA SOURCES AND A HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF AN ANALYSIS
 TASK, PRODUCE A WELL-CALIBRATED WORKING MODEL THAT SOLVES EFFICIENTLY ON THE COMPUTATIONAL
 PLATFORM AT HAND, AND OUTPUT THIS MODEL ALONG WITH RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS. THE INTERNAL
 PROCESSING WOULD STITCH TOGETHER MANY SIMPLE, OF THE SHELF TECHNIQUES FOR DATA ANALYSIS,
 AUTOMATICALLY TUNING THE PARAMETERS REQUIRED TO FUSE THE DIFFERENT METHODS. THE OUTPUT WOULD
 INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIMES IN WHICH THE MODEL PERFORMS BEST, A REPORT ON WHICH
 ALGORITHMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVELY FOR THE ANALYSIS TASK, AND GUIDANCE AS TO WHEN CHANGES IN THE DATA
 WOULD REQUIRE RECALIBRATION OF THE MODEL, A SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MODEL, OR A CHANGE IN ALGORITHM.
 OUR PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ADVANCES IN THREE SPECIFIC AREAS. FIRST, WE WILL DEVISE AND IMPLEMENT A
 HIGH-LEVEL DECLARATIVE MODELING LANGUAGE IN WHICH DATA ANALYSTS CAN DESCRIBE ANALYSIS TASKS IN
 SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE TERMS. THE LANGUAGE WILL BE A POWERFUL PLATFORM FOR DESIGNING,
 IMPLEMENTING, AND SELECTING DATA ANALYSIS METHODS. SECOND, WE PROPOSED A BROAD, GENERAL, AND
 PRINCIPLED ALGORITHMIC FRAMEWORK FOR INFORMATION INTEGRATION AND ANALYSIS TASKS. OUR FRAMEWORK
 WILL BUILD ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH MODELING AND ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING MATRIX AND TENSOR
 COMPLETION, REGULARIZATION, AND STOCHASTIC GRADIENT ALGORITHMS. THIRD, WE WILL DEVISE AND
 IMPLEMENT AUTOMATIC TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL PARAMETER SETTINGS IN ALGORITHMS AND
 MODELS. OFTEN, THE QUALITY OF THE ANALYSIS AND EFFICIENCY OF ALGORITHMS DEPEND CRITICALLY ON GOOD
 CHOICES OF PARAMETERS, AN EFFICIENT METHOD FOR DETERMINING SUCH VALUES NEED TO BE MUCH BETTER
 UNDERSTOOD. PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT,
 PROVIDING A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE WORK YET TO BE PERFORMED",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_N000141310129_9700/,2015-04-21 16:27:26+00

THE APPROACH SEEKS TO IDENTIFY SUBSTITUTIONAL SOLUTE SPECIES THAT (I) LEAD TO A THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE HCP SOLID-SOLUTION PHASE WITH A HIGH MELTING POINT, AND (II) MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE THE DESIRABLE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF RE, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR ITS EXCELLENT ROOM-TEMPERATURE DUCTILITY. THE COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AT UC BERKELEY WILL BE LED BY PROF. ASTA AND WILL FOCUS ON ISSUE (II), AND WILL BE PERFORMED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE EFFORT AT BROWN DEVOTED TO TOPIC (I). A JUNIOR RESEARCHER WHO IS CURRENTLY IN RESIDENCE IN THE GROUP OF PROF. ASTA, AND WHO HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO THE MATERIALS SCIENCE PHD PROGRAM FOR FALL 2012, WILL BE SUPPORTED TO PERFORM FIRST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS OF THE COMPOSITION-DEPENDENT ENERGETICS OF TWINS AND STACKING FAULTS IN HCP-BASED RE ALLOYS. THE PURPOSE OF THESE CALCULATIONS WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF CANDIDATE SOLUTE SPECIES ON DEFORMATION MECHANISMS MEDIATED BY DISLOCATION SLIP AND TWINNING. THE CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED FIRST FOR PURE RE AND RANDOM BINARY ALLOYS OF RE WITH DILUTE CONCENTRATIONS OF REFRACTORY-METAL SUBSTITUTIONAL SOLUTE SPECIES (E.G., MO, W, AND NB). AS THE RESEARCH UNDER TOPIC (I) PROGRESSES, WE WILL FOCUS THE EFFORT ON MORE CONCENTRATED ALLOYS, INCLUDING OTHER CANDIDATE SUBSTITUTIONAL SPECIES AND INCORPORATING EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SHORT-RANGE ORDER AS CHARACTERIZED BY THE MONTE-CARLO MODELING UNDERTAKEN AT BROWN. THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFORTS AT BROWN AND UC BERKELEY WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT LED BY PROF. MORRIS AT UC BERKELEY. THE EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT WILL INVOLVE MECHANICAL TESTING OF RE-BASED ALLOY SAMPLES THAT WILL BE PURCHASED BY AN OUTSIDE VENDOR. THE TESTING WILL BE USED TO CONFIRM THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ACCURACY OF THE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND TO ELUCIDATE OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CALCULATIONS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY SCREEN FOR OPTIMAL ALLOY COMPOSITIONS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_N000141210557_1700/,2012-07-25 16:20:47+00

 THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF TWO ELEMENTS:
 1. DEVELOP A FOUR-YEAR PRIORITY STRATEGY TO INVENTORY OAK WOODLANDS AND BISHOP PINE STAND
 2. IMPLEMENT THE SECOND YEAR INVENTORY ON APPROXIMATELY 3000 ACRES OF MIXED OAK
 WOODLANDS AND 168 ACRES OF TANOAK
 THE END PRODUCT WILL BE A REPORT IN WHICH, BASED ON A RANGE OF METRICS, VANDENBERG OAK WOODLANDS WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC CURRENT HEALTH CLASS AND ALSO TO A SPECIFIC RISK RATE CLASS. THIS WILL ALLOW MANAGERS TO: A)- IDENTIFY AREAS ARE OF HIGH VALUE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED, AND; B)- IDENTIFY AREAS THAT ARE AT HIGH RISK (INCLUDING TREES AT RISK OF FAILING) WHERE SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT APPROACHES MAY BE REQUIRED TO PREVENT INJURIES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W9126G1820040_2100/,2018-12-18 17:40:56+00

THE DESIGN CREATES TWO IDENTICAL BROAD BAND ISOLATED ATTOSECOND PULSES BY A PAIR OF GRAZING INCIDENCE SPLIT MIRRORS, ONE TO CREATE THE DELAY BY SLIGHT DISPLACEMENT OF THE TOTAL DISTANCE TRAVELED AND THE SECOND TO COMPENSATE FOR SPATIAL DISPLACEMENT OF THE TWO PULSES. THESE PULSES ARE RECOMBINED AT THE SAMPLE, AND THEN DIVERGE AGAIN ONTO A GRATING AND X-RAY CAMERA. TWO SYNCHRONIZED PULSES WITH DIFFERENT CENTER WAVELENGTHS CAN ALSO BE INCORPORATED WITH SELECTIVE METAL FILTERS OR TWIN HIGH HARMONIC GENERATION SOURCES.  INSERTION OF A KIRKPATRICK  BAEZ MIRROR PAIR PROVIDES FOCUSING TO  1 &#956; M SPATIAL DIMENSIONS.   INITIAL CHARACTERIZATION MEASUREMENTS ARE DESIGNED AROUND RARE GASES TO REALIZE ATTOSECOND-ATTOSECOND PUMP-PROBE DELAYS, USING MULTIPHOTON IONIZATION AND TRANSIENT ABSORPTION.  THE BENCHMARK APPLICATION IS THE INVESTIGATION OF THE HIGHLY CORRELATED MATERIAL, V02 ,  TO ADDRESS THE UNANSWERED QUESTION OF WHETHER INDIRECT STRUCTURAL CHANGES OR DIRECT ELECTRON-ELECTRON CORRELATION EFFECTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSULATOR-TO-METAL TRANSITION.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W31P4Q1310017_2100/,2017-09-20 16:09:00+00
