THE PERFECT PROGRAM WILL LEVERAGE AND INCORPORATE ANTICIPATED INDUSTRY FABRICATION GEOMETRY ADVANCES TO 7 NM. SINCE NO OPERATIONAL HARDWARE IS TO BE BUILT IN THIS PROGRAM, A SIMULATION CAPABILITY WILL BE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE AND DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS. THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROCESSING POWER EFFICIENCIES AND PERFORMANCE, AND IS NOT CONCERNED WITH DEVELOPMENTS THAT FOCUS ON EXASCALE PROCESSING ISSUES.
 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PERFECT PROGRAM, THE EMBEDDED SCALABLE PLATFORMS (ESP) TEAM WILL DEVELOP
 A NEW GENERATION OF PLATFORM ARCHITECTURES THAT YIELD OPTIMAL ENERGY-PERFORMANCE OPERATIONS WHILE
 SUPPORTING A DIVERSITY OF EMBEDDED APPLICATION WORKLOADS. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A SET OF SCALABLE INNOVATIONS IN CIRCUITS, ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE, AND CAD INCLUDING: SCALABLE 3D-STACKED VOLTAGE
 REGULATORS FOR INTEGRATED FINE-GRAIN POWER MANAGEMENT; HIGHLY-RESILIENT NEAR-THRESHOLD-VOLTAGE OPERATION
 THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY MANAGEMENT; SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF PROGRAMMABLE CORES AND SPECIALIZED ACCELERATORS INTO A SCALABLE SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC) ARCHITECTURE ORGANIZED IN A TILE-BASED DESIGN; SCALABLE NETWORK-ON-CHIP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BOTH MESSAGE-PASSING COMMUNICATIONS AND DISTRIBUTED
 POWER CONTROL; STATIC AND DYNAMIC SCHEDULING OF ON-CHIP RESOURCES DRIVEN BY PERFORMANCE PROFILING; AND AN INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT FOR FULL-SYSTEM SIMULATION AND APPLICATION-DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION. LED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND COMPRISING RESEARCHERS FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UC BERKELEY, AND IBM, THE ESP TEAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH INNOVATIONS THROUGH THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO MULTI-CORE SOC PROTOTYPES WHICH WILL BE FABRICATED BY IBM.
 PHASE I. BASIC TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS. (18 MONTHS) IN PHASE I, WE WILL FOCUS ON BASIC TECHNOLOGY
 DEMONSTRATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENABLE THE ESPI PROTOTYPE IN PHASE II.

DEMONSTRATION OF 3D-INTEGRATED SIVRS SUPPORTING AT LEAST 16 POWER DOMAINS WITH AN AVERAGE EFFICIENCY OF AT LEAST 85% AT AN INPUT VOLTAGE OF GREATER THAN 2 V AND AT A MAXIMUM CURRENT OF 10 A PER DOMAIN WITH AN AVERAGE VOLTAGE RIPPLE OF LESS THAN 15 M V AND A RESPONSE TIME OF LESS THAN 5 NS.
 GALLAGHER, SULLIVAN, KNICKERBOCKER, ANDRY (IBM): SHEPARD (COLUMBIA).
 COMPLETION CRITERIA AND DELIVERABLES: FUNCTIONING SIVR HARDWARE.
 APPROACH: ACHIEVING THIS MILESTONE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION OF THE POWER INDUCTOR STRUCTURES AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION D. THE INTERPOSER WILL CONTAIN THE INDUCTORS,CAPACITORS, AND THE POWER TRAIN OF THE BUCK CONVERTER WHILE THE CONTROL CIRCUITRY WILL BE ON THE PROCESSOR LAYER. ALL DESIGN WILL BE
 DONE AT COLUMBIA AND ALL FABRICATION AT IBM.
 MILESTONE 1.1.2. MAPPING OF ARM PROCESSORS TO AN IBM 32-NM (OR 22-NM) SOL CMOS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING MULTIPHASE LATCH-BASED DESIGN AND LOW-COST TIMING-ERROR MONITORS. SEOK, SHEPARD (COLUMBIA).

 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PERFECT PROGRAM, THE EMBEDDED SCALABLE PLATFORMS (ESP) TEAM WILL DEVELOP
 A NEW GENERATION OF PLATFORM ARCHITECTURES THAT YIELD OPTIMAL ENERGY-PERFORMANCE OPERATIONS WHILE
 SUPPORTING A DIVERSITY OF EMBEDDED APPLICATION WORKLOADS. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A SET OF SCALABLE INNOVATIONS IN CIRCUITS, ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE, AND CAD INCLUDING: SCALABLE 3D-STACKED VOLTAGE
 REGULATORS FOR INTEGRATED FINE-GRAIN POWER MANAGEMENT; HIGHLY-RESILIENT NEAR-THRESHOLD-VOLTAGE OPERATION
 THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY MANAGEMENT; SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF PROGRAMMABLE CORES AND SPECIALIZED ACCELERATORS INTO A SCALABLE SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC) ARCHITECTURE ORGANIZED IN A TILE-BASED DESIGN; SCALABLE NETWORK-ON-CHIP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BOTH MESSAGE-PASSING COMMUNICATIONS AND DISTRIBUTED
 POWER CONTROL; STATIC AND DYNAMIC SCHEDULING OF ON-CHIP RESOURCES DRIVEN BY PERFORMANCE PROFILING; AND AN INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT FOR FULL-SYSTEM SIMULATION AND APPLICATION-DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION. LED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND COMPRISING RESEARCHERS FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UC BERKELEY, AND IBM, THE ESP TEAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH INNOVATIONS THROUGH THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO MULTI-CORE SOC PROTOTYPES WHICH WILL BE FABRICATED BY IBM.

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVEL OP DETAILED CHEMICAL-KINETICS BASED, INTEGRATED SOOT MODELS FOR LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION (LES) OF GAS TURBINE ENGINE COMBUSTION.  THE PROPOSAL IS A CONTINUATION OF THE ONGOING COLLABORATIVE WORK UNDER THE SAME SPONSOR.  THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TO BE COV ERED AT UC BERKELEY ARE IN THE AREA OF CHEMICAL MODELING. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE UC BERKELEY TEAM FROM THE PRIOR FUNDING ARE: COMPLETED MD SIMULATIONS OF COLLISIONS OF OXYGENATED PAHS, ESTABLISHED THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY OF KEY OXYGENATED RADICAL  INTERMEDIATES, AND INITIATED INVESTIGATION OF REACTION KINETICS OF SOOT OXIDATION.  THE PROPOSED NEW TASKS TO BE PERFORMED ARE AS FOLLOWS. 1)COMPLETION OF SURFACE OXIDATION MODEL. THE THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE SOOT OXIDATION KINETICS WILL BE COMPLET ED AND A DETAILED RACTION MODEL CREATED DESCRIBING OXIDATIVE DESTRUCTION OF SOOT.  THE INITIAL MODEL WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE PRIMARY OXIDATIVE AGENTS, O2 AND OH.  ADDITIONAL SPECIES WILL BE ADDED (E.G., H2O, HO2, CO2, ETC) DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJE CT. THIS WILL EXTEND MODEL APPLICABILITY TO A BROADER VARIETY OF FUELS AND COMBUSTION ENVIRONMENTS.  ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO EMERGING ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND NOVEL ENERGY-GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES. 2)GENERATION OF THE COMBINED MODEL.  THE DETAILED RE ACTION MODEL OF SOOT OXIDATION, DEVELOPED IN PART 1 ABOVE, WILL BE COMBINED WITH A DETAILED REACTION MODEL OF SOOT PARTICLE GROWTH.  THE INITIAL MODEL WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE ONGOING WORK OF FRENKLACH UNDER THE DOE-BES PROGRAM. THE MODEL WILL BE CONTI NUOUSLY UPDATED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE DOE-BES STUDY AND TO ACCOUNT FOR ADDITIONAL GROWTH SPECIES REQUIRED FOR APPLICATION TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND NOVEL ENERGY-GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 3)DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMPLE KINETIC MODE L.  A SIMPLE KINETIC MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REPRESENT ACCURATELY THE DYNAMICS OF THE COMBINED DETAILED SURFACE MODEL BUT IN A COMPUTATIONALLY ECONOMIC MANNER FOR INCLUSION INTO THE LES FLAME MODELS.  THE DEVELOPMENT WILL INCLUDE PERFORMING A SERI ES OF DETAILED MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS AT THE CONDITIONS CAPTURING THE FLAME ENVIRONMENTS AND PARAMETERIZING THE RESULTS INTO A SIMPLE, ONE-OR TWO-STEP KINETIC MODEL.  THE KINETIC PARAMETERIZATION WILL BE BASED ON TWO PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS: PARAMETERIZ ING AND FITTING THE NUCLEATION RATE AND PARAMETERIZING AND FITTING THE SURFACE GROWTH RATE.  FOR THE NUCLEATION RATE WE WILL START BY EMPLOYING THE PYRENE-COLLISION MODEL WITH AN ADJUSTABLE PARAMETER, CALIBRATED IN A CONSISTENT AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER,  EXPLORING ITS POSSIBLE DEPENDENCIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES (TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE) AND THE INITIAL FUEL.  FOR THE SURFACE GROWTH/OXIDATION RATE WE WILL START WITH THE PAST PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME AND EXPAND IT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF  THE SURFACE PROCESSES DISCOVERED SINCE THEN. 4)VALIDATION OF THE CHEMICAL MODEL.  THE VALIDATION WILL BE PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS.  FIRST, WE WILL VALIDATE THE COMPLETE DETAILED REACTION MODEL, COMPOSED OF THE MAIN-COMBUSTION REACTIONS, SOOT SURFACE GROWTH MECHANISM, AND SOOT SURFACE OXIDATION REACTIONS.  THIS PART OF THE VALIDATION WILL BE BASED ON LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED UTILIZING THE PRIME INFRASTRUCTURE.  IN THE SECOND STEP OF THE VALIDATION WE WILL TEST THE SIMPLE, P ARAMETERIZED KINETIC MODEL AGAINST THE DETAILED MODEL.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_W912HQ11C0035_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2013-05-16 10:54:34+00

THE INITIAL MODEL WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE PRIMARY OXIDATIVE AGENTS, 02 AND OH. ADDITIONAL SPECIES WILL BE ADDED (E.G."" H20, H02, C02, ETC) DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT. THIS WILL EXTEND MODEL APPLICABILITY TO A BROADER VARIETY OF FUELS AND COMBUSTION ENVIRONMENTS. ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO EMERGING ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND NOVEL ENERGY-GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES,
 2)GENERATION OF THE COMBINED MODEL. THE DETAILED REACTION MODEL OF SOOT OXIDATION, DEVELOPED IN PART 1 ABOVE, WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE DETAILED REACTION MODEL OF SOOT PARTICLE GROWTH. THE INITIAL MODEL WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE ONGOING WORK OF FRENKLACH UNDER THE DOE-BES PROGRAM. THE MODEL WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE DOE-BES STUDY AND TO ACCOUNT FOR ADDITIONAL GROWTH SPECIES REQUIRED FOR APPLICATION TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND NOVEL ENERGY-GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
 3) DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMPLE KINETIC MODEL. A SIMPLE KINETIC MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED TO REPRESENT ACCURATELY THE DYNAMICS OF THE COMBINED DETAILED SURFACE MODEL BUT IN A COMPUTATIONALLY ECONOMIC MANNER FOR THE INCLUSION INTO THE LES FLAME MODELS. THE DEVELOPMENT WILL INCLUDE PERFORMING A SERIES OF DETAILED MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS AT THE CONDITIONS CAPTURING THE FLAME ENVIRONMENTS AND PARAMETERIZING THE RESULTS INTO A SIMPLE, ONE- OR TW-STEP KINETIC MODEL. THE KINETIC PARAMETERIZATION WILL BE BASED ON TWO PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS: PARAMETERIZING AND FITTING THE NUCLEATION RATE AND PARAMETERIZING AND FITTING THE SURFACE GROWTH RATE. FOR THE NUCLEATION RATE WE WILL START BY EMPLOYING THE PYRENE-COLLISION MODEL WITH AN ADJUSTABLE PARAMETER, CALIBRATED IN A CONSISTENT AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER, EXPLORING ITS POSSIBLE DEPENDENCIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES (TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE) AND THE INITIAL FUEL. FOR THE SURFACE GROWTH/OXIDATION RATE WE WILL START WITH THE PAST PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME AND EXPAND IT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SURFACE GROWTH/OXIDATION RATE WE WILL START WITH THE PAST PARAMETERIZATION SCHEME AND EXPAND IT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SURFACE PROCESSES DISCOVERED SINCE THEN.
 4) VALIDATION OF THE CHEMICAL MODEL. THE VALIDATION WILL BE PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS, FIRST WE WILL VALIDATE THE COMPLETE DETAILED REACTION MODEL, COMPOSED OF THE MAIN-COMBUSTION REACTIONS, SOOT SURFACE GROWTH MECHANISM, AND SOOT SURFACE OXIDATION REACTIONS. THIS PART OF THE VALIDATION WILL BE BASED ON LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED UTILIZING THE PRIME INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE SECOND STEP OF THE VALIDATION WE WILL TEST THE SIMPLE, PARAMETERIZED KINETIC MODEL AGAINSTED THE DETAILED MODEL.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_W912HQ11C0035_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2011-11-14 12:51:50+00
