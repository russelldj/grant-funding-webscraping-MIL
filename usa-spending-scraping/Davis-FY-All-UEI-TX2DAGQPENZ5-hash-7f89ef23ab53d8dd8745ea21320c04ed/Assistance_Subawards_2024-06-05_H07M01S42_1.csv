 THE LAST DECADE HAS SEEN A LARGE PART OF THE DIGITAL WORLD SHIFTED INTO THE CLOUD AND THE PROLIFERATION OF DATACENTERS. THE TYPICAL DATACENTER SIZE HAS ALSO SOARED: MOST RECENT HYPERSCALE
 DATACENTERS CONTAIN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SERVERS. THESE MANY SERVERS PROCESS DATA, BUT ALSO RECEIVE AND EXCHANGE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION. DATA COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN DATA CENTERS EXCEEDS BY OVER AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DATA TRANSITING OVER THE INTERNET. ALREADY TODAY, A MAJOR STRESS IS PLACED ONTO DIN. DINS, HOWEVER, MIGHT BE YET UNDER HIGHER PRESSURE WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL CLOUD DATA ANALYTICS APPLICATIONS RELYING ON MACHINE AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. THESE TECHNIQUES, USED FOR EXAMPLE IN STREAMING VIDEO OBJECT RECOGNITION, INVOLVE MASSIVELY PARALLEL PROCESSING UNITS (GPU) AND MANYCORE (CPU) PROCESSORS FURTHER PUSHING THE LIMITS ON CURRENT DIN ARCHITECTURES AND MEMORY-TO-CPU/GPU LINKS. IN THIS NEW CONTEXT WHERE COMPUTE INFRASTRUCTURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY LIMITED BY THE
 ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE DATA OVER ANY DISTANCE, IT IS CRUCIAL TO IMPROVE ENERGY AND COST EFFICIENCIES OF COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT AIMS AT DEVELOPING A PLATFORM IN AIM PHOTONICS TO PROVIDE SUCH HIGH COST AND ENERGY EFFICIENT OPTICAL LINKS AND FABRICS, ABLE TO THOROUGHLY CATER FOR FUTURE DATACOM REQUIREMENTS. THIS PROJECT TARGETS INNOVATION IN MANUFACTURING OF INTEGRATED SILICON PHOTONICS DIES FOR ULTRAHIGH SPEED TRANSCEIVERS, THE REALIZATION OF PHOTONIC LINKS SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED WITH CONVENTIONAL COMPUTER CHIPS AS CPU, GPU AND MEMORY MODULES, AND INTEGRATED SILICON PHOTONIC SWITCHES ALLOWING BANDWIDTH TO BE STEERED ON DEMAND AMONG DIVERSE RESOURCES. HIGH CAPACITY, COST AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PHOTONIC INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS REQUIRE DENSE FABRICATION PROCESSES WITH HIGH YIELD, PHOTONIC INTERPOSERS AND INTEGRATION FOR OPTOELECTRONIC INTEGRATION AND PACKAGING, AND AUTOMATED CHARACTERIZATION AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING.

 PERFORMANCE COMPUTING PLATFORMS TO MEET TWO CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) HIGH-SPEED SWITCHING FOR BANDWIDTH-DENSE CHANNELS (TB/S), AND (2) HIGH-RADIX CONNECTIVITY FOR FINE-GRANULARITY END-POINTS
 ACROSS MANY CHANNELS. TWO MAJOR PHOTONIC FUNCTIONALITIES, OR PRIMITIVES, CAN BE USED TO MEET THESE
 REQUIREMENTS: OPTICAL SPATIAL SWITCHING AND WAVELENGTH SELECTIVITY. THIS PROJECT WILL BE A KEY DEMONSTRATOR OF THE POWER AND QUALITY OF PHOTONIC INTEGRATION. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT INTEGRATION OF HUNDREDS OF DEVICES IN THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION AND THOUSANDS IN
 SUBSEQUENT YEARS. AN 8X8 OPTICAL SWITCH WITH THE CAPABILITY OF DROPPING TWO WAVELENGTHS AT EACH CROSSPOINT REQUIRES AT LEAST 128 DEVICES, AND PROBABLY 256 TO ALLOW FOR MONITORING OF THE SWITCH AT
 INTERMEDIATE POINTS. IT WILL PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE EPDA TEAM AS THE SPREAD IN PERFORMANCE OF NOMINALLY IDENTICAL DEVICES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED. THE LARGE NUMBER OF OPTICAL INPUT/OUTPUT (""1/0"") (INITIALLY 8 FIBERS, BUT SOON 128 FIBERS) WILL DRIVE THE OPTICAL PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY. THE INTEGRATION OF
 ELECTRONIC DRIVERS AND MONITORS IS A GOOD TEST OF THE 3D STACKING TECHNOLOGY AND EPDA MODELS FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE. SCALING THIS STRUCTURE TO LARGER SIZES REQUIRES OPTICAL GAIN TO BE INCORPORATED, WHICH IS PLANNED IN LATER YEARS. 
 (2) ""EDWFD"" THE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS WILL PROVIDE THE UNIFIED KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY AND WORKFORCE INTERFACE FOR AIM PHOTONICS. SUCCESS FOR AIM ACADEMY WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH FIVE COORDINATED STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES:
   EDUCATION: CREATION AND DISSEMINATION OF SCALABLE, STACKABLE INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCES THAT PREPARE STUDENTS AND INTEGRATED PHOTONICS TECHNICIANS, ENGINEERS AND RESEARCHERS TO BUILD PRODUCTIVE CAREERS AND A STRONG U.S. INDUSTRY.
   WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT: IDENTIFY SKILLS GAPS AND EMPLOYMENT NEEDS, CREATE ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS TRAINING DEVELOPED TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE INTEGRATED PHOTONICS WORKFORCE DEMANDS.
   ROADMAP: TO COORDINATE AND ARCHIVE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY CREATION AMONG THE AIM PHOTONICS PROJECTS WITH AN INTEGRATED PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP THAT BUILDS A COHERENT COHORT AMONG AIM PHOTONICS AND THE INDUSTRY WORKFORCES; DEFINES THE DIFFICULT TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES; AND CREATES THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY.
   ASSESSMENT: METRICS WILL BE APPLIED TO ASSESS PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES ON THE OBJECTIVES OF CREATING COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN MANUFACTURING BY MAKING THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE DEMAND FOR WORKFORCE SKILLS, BUILDING THE INDUSTRY-ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS, AND PROGRAMS FOR WORKERS TO EXPAND THEIR SKILL SETS FOR THE INTEGRATED PHOTONICS MANUFACTURING SECTOR.
   PROGRAM SUPPORT, MANAGEMENT, AND COORDINATION: CREATE THE PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCES THAT SUPPORT EMERGENCE OF THE AIM PHOTONICS INTEGRATED PHOTONICS MANUFACTURING PLATFORM AND ITS U.S. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS, AND REPRESENT AIM ACADEMY TO AIM PHOTONICS, NATIONAL NETWORK FOR MANUFACTURING INNOVATION (""NNMI"") AND INTEGRATED PHOTONICS MANUFACTURING ("" IPM"" ) COMMUNITY CONSTITUENCIES. LEAD DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION FACTORY FACILITIES. INTERFACE WITH OTHER MANUFACTURING INSTITUTES IN EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE PROGRAMS.
 (3)""HIGH CAPACITY PHOTONIC INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS"" THE PROJECT ADDRESSES TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR DATACENTERS AND MORE BROADLY FOR DATACOM SYSTEMS - HIGH-CAPACITY COMMUNICATIONS AND HIGH EFFICIENCY SWITCHING. THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE
 DEVELOPED UNDER THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE AS A BASIS FOR ARCHITECTURAL EVOLUTION OF DATACOM SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY BY REDUCING THE ENERGY FOOTPRINT OF POWER-HUNGRY ELECTRONICS, BRINGING PHOTONICS CLOSER TO

 AND OTHER CONGENITAL BIRTH DEFECTS IN THEIR INFANTS, THE SO-CALLED CONGENITAL ZIKA
 SYNDROME. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LICENSED VACCINE TO PREVENT ZIKA VIRUS (ZIKV).
 THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AT RISK,
 PARTICULARLY PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR FETUSES. ZIKV INFECTION OF RHESUS MACAQUES HAS
 BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE USEFUL ANIMAL MODEL TO STUDY PATHOGENESIS AND PROVIDE PROOFOF-
 CONCEPT OF ANTIVIRAL INTERVENTIONS.
 THE ADMINISTRATION OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST ZIKA VIRUS DURING PREGNANCY HAS
 THE POTENTIAL TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING THE FETUS AGAINST INFECTION, OR IN REDUCING VIRUS
 REPLICATION IF THE FETUS IS ALREADY INFECTED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF
 THE TRANSPLACENTAL TRANSFER OF SUCH ANTIBODIES LATE IN PREGNANCY. THE PROPOSED STUDIES
 ARE AIMED AT STUDYING THE TRANSPLACENTAL TRANSFER OF SUCH ANTI-ZIKA ANTIBODIES IN THE
 PREGNANT RHESUS MACAQUE MODEL. FOUR PREGNANT ANIMALS WILL BE ADMINISTERED
 ANTIBODIES APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS PRIOR TO C-SECTION. AT TIME OF C-SECTION, MATERNAL
 BLOOD AND CORD BLOOD WILL BE COLLECTED TO DETERMINE ANTIBODY LEVELS IN BOTH
 COMPARTMENTS.
 THE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED AT THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTER.

THIS IS A MULTI-CENTER COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AIMED AT THE KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDING SAFE EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR THE BRAIN IN TROOPS EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE BLAST EVENTS. WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS (UC DAVIS) ON SOME OF THE PARALLEL WORK THAT WE ARE FUNDING WITH THE UNIFORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES (USUHS) INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS FOR MEASURING SMALL WORLD CONNECTIVITY IN ADNI DOD DATASETS.  WHILE USUHS INVESTIGATOR DR. RAPP'S GROUP IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ALGORITHMS IN A MEG SETTING, WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT SMALL WORLD CONNECTIVITY UNDER RESTING STATE CONDITIONS AND ANALYZING OPEN SOURCE DATA (I.E., ADNI-DOD). 
 
 THE DAVIDSON LAB HAS CREATED A PIPELINE TO CREATE GRAPHS FROM FMRI IMAGING OF THE ADNI DOD DATA SET. THIS DATA SET AS OF TODAY CONTAINS 12 PTSD, 10 TBI, 23 CONTROL AND 9 PTSD AND TBI DIAGNOSED VIETNAM VETERANS. EVENTUALLY THIS ONGOING STUDY AIMS TO HAVE 85 OF EACH POPULATION. SEE (HTTP://ADNI.LONI.USC.EDU/STUDY- DESIGN/COLLABORATIVE-STUDIES/DOD-ADNI/) FOR DETAILS.
 PRELIMINARY WORK INDICATES A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GRAPHS OF TWO POPULATIONS (PTSD AND CONTROL) IN TERMS OF PATH LENGTHS AND CLUSTER COEFFICIENTS INDICATING THAT THE PTSD DIAGNOSED PATIENTS HAVE DIFFERENT GRAPH PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GRAPHS NEEDS TO BE MORE CAREFULLY EXPLORED AND EXPANDED TO THE FULL POPULATIONS.
 
 THIS RESEARCH PLANS TO USE ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS IN NEUROIMAGING DATA. IN PARTICULAR, WE PLAN TO EXAMINE LINEAR ALGEBRA FORMULATIONS OF REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SPARSITY AS A FORM OF GUIDANCE FOR INTERPRETABLE RESULTS. RESULTS WILL BE VALIDATED ON NEUROIMAGING DATA FOR WHICH PROFESSOR IAN DAVIDSON HAS THE EXPERTISE AND MOTIVATION NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE PROPOSED RESEARCH. HIS PARTICULAR RESEARCH EXPERTISE IS IN THE AREA OF COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING. PROFESSOR DAVIDSON IS AN NSF CAREER GRANT AWARDEE ON THE AREA OF USING GUIDANCE IN UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND HE HAS SPENT THE PAST FIVE YEARS WORKING ON THIS TOPIC. 
 
 WE PROPOSED TO COMPLETE THE FULL SET OF SMALL WORLD ANALYSIS PERFORMED IN EXISTING STUDIES BUT ALSO EXTEND THIS WORK IN SEVERAL DIMENSIONS TO: I) DIFFERENT GRAPHS AND II) MORE INFORMATIVE MEASURES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_HU00011520024_9700/,2017-03-30 11:40:20+00
