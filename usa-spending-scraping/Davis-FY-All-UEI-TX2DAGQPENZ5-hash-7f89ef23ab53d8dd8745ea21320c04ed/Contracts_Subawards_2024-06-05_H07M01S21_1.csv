 THE OBJECTIVE OF UCD IS TO BUILD A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING AND TRANSFER LEARNING LEADING TO UNPRECEDENTED REDUCTION OF LABELED DATA REQUIRED FOR LEARNING WITHOUT LOSS OF PERFORMANCE. 
 PHASE II (DURATION: 15 MONTHS) 
 TASK 1. SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING FOR VISION (DURATION: 15 MONTHS) 
 OBJECTIVE: DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING TO REDUCE NUMBER OF LABELS REQUIRED AND SUPPORT OBJECT DETECTION, OBJECT CLASSIFICATION, AND VIDEO ACTIVITY RECOGNITION CHALLENGES. 
 APPROACH: UCD WILL DEVELOP SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT LEVERAGE A TARGET DATASET WITHOUT LABELS. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON VIDEO-ACTIVITY RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT FOR HRL ON OBJECT DETECTION. 
 MEASURABLE MILESTONE: DEMONSTRATION OF IMPROVEMENT OVER STANDARD FEW SHOT LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR VIDEO ACTIVITY RECOGNITION (MONTHS 2 & 14). 
 DELIVERABLE: ANY TECHNICAL PAPERS COVERING WORK FUNDED BY LWLL. VIDEO ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION SOFTWARE (MONTH 2). SOFTWARE UPDATE (MONTH 12) 
 TASK 2. TRANSFER LEARNING FOR VISION (DURATION: 15 MONTHS) 
 OBJECTIVE: IMPROVE TRANSFER LEARNING FOR IMAGES AND VIDEO TO REDUCE NUMBER OF LABELS REQUIRED AND SUPPORT OBJECT DETECTION, OBJECT CLASSIFICATION, AND ACTIVITY RECOGNITION CHALLENGES. APPROACH: UCD WILL DEVELOP ALGORITHMS TO TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE FROM PREVIOUSLY LEARNED MODELS TO A NEW TASK. UCD WILL DEVELOP ALGORITHMS THAT LEVERAGE SEVERAL LABELED TRAINING SETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE DARPA EVALUATIONS. 
 MEASURABLE MILESTONE: DEMONSTRATE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AFTER TRANSFERRING THE KNOWLEDGE COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL METHODS (MONTHS 2 & 14). 
 DELIVERABLE: ANY TECHNICAL PAPERS COVERING WORK FUNDED BY LWLL. 
 TRAVEL: UCD WILL TRAVEL TO 3 SEMI-ANNUAL PI MEETINGS IN THE WASHINGTON DC AREA (1 PERSON).",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_FA875019C0098_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2021-11-16 19:34:29+00

MOST EDNA DETECTION METHODS FOCUS ON MTDNA OR REPEATING ELEMENTS OF THE NUCLEAR GENOME BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY COPIES FOR EVERY COPY OF NON-REPEATING NUCLEAR LOCI IN A CELL.

A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR ESTIMATING POPULATION SIZE FROM EDNA IS CORRECTING FOR INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE CONTRIBUTION (I.E., PRODUCTION) OF EDNA AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN A POPULATION. TWO WAYS TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THIS ARE 1) TO USE SEQUENCE FRAGMENTS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE SITES OF INFORMATIVE VARIATION (SNPS) AND 2) TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MANY INDEPENDENT LOCI ACROSS THE GENOME. THE LONGER A FRAGMENT IS, THE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE OBTAINED BECAUSE DATA FROM MULTIPLE CLOSELY LINKED SNPS CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE HAPLOTYPES, WHICH CAN THEN BE TREATED AS POLYALLELIC GENETIC MARKERS. POLYALLELIC MARKERS PROVIDE MORE POWER FOR GENETIC ASSIGNMENT COMPARED TO SINGLE BI-ALLELIC SNPS. THUS, DATA FROM MANY INDEPENDENT POLYALLELIC LOCI WILL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL POWER AND BE OPTIMAL FOR ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY IN EDNA SAMPLES. WE WILL TEST WHETHER FRAGMENTS OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH ARE AVAILABLE FROM TARGET SPECIES IN EDNA SAMPLES COLLECTED UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE VARIABLE SITES ON FRAGMENTS USING PAIRED-END READS.

BASED ON THESE DATA WE WILL DERIVE GENE EXPRESSION MODELS USED DOWNSTREAM FOR SINGLE CELL PLACEMENT. A SUBSET OF THESE WILL BE VALIDATED BY RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION. INITIAL ANALYSIS WILL FOCUS ON THE ENDODERMAL RP2 CIRCUIT, WHICH WILL BE THE TARGET OF TEAM INVESTIGATION DURING PHASE 1.

   SUB-SUB TASK 1.1.1. USE A TARGETED APPROACH TO MINE OUR EXISTING TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA SETS TO IDENTIFY EXPRESSED NERVE CELL GENES SPECIFIC TO THE TENTACLE, HEAD, BODY, OR FOOT OF HYDRA.
 O APPROACH: WE HAVE ALREADY COLLECTED PILOT TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA SETS FROM THE FOLLOWING HYDRA BODY REGIONS AND LINEAGES: 1. TENTACLE, 2. HEAD, 3. BODY, 4. FOOT, 5. INTERSTITIAL LINEAGE (THIS INCLUDES THE NERVE CELLS), 6. ENDODERMAL LINEAGE, AND 7. ECTODERMAL LINEAGE. WE WILL INTERROGATE THIS PILOT DATA SET AND COMPILE A LIST OF RELEVANT NERVE CELL GENES THROUGH GENE ANNOTATION AND GENE ONTOLOGY ANALYSIS (I.E. HOMOLOGY SEARCHES). WE WILL USE OUR TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA SETS TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE NEURONAL GENES ARE SPATIALLY DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN TENTACLE, HEAD, BODY, OR FOOT. WE WILL USE RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TO VALIDATE SPATIAL EXPRESSION OF  IDENTIFIED GENES. SPECIFIC GENE PROMOTERS FOR USE IN GENETICALLY ENGINEERING THE HYDRA NERVE NET WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY MAKING USE OF THE HYDRA GENOME (HTTP://HYDRADB.ORG) AND AVAILABLE GENOMIC DATA SETS FOR HYDRA VULGARIS (AEP) WHICH HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BY DR. STEELE. 
 O START-END DATE: MONTH 0/6
 O MILESTONE 1.1.1. IDENTIFICATION OF AN INITIAL SET OF NERVE CELL-SPECIFIC GENES AND A DECIPHERING OF THEIR SPATIAL EXPRESSION PATTERNS.
 O PERFORMER: JULIANO
 O DELIVERABLE: PILOT SET OF PROMOTERS AND TARGET GENES WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE TEAM FOR EXPLORATORY GENETIC ENGINEERING. ANALYSIS OF SPATIAL EXPRESSION PATTERNS BY RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION WILL ALLOW US TO DELIVER GENES SPECIFICALLY EXPRESSED IN THE ENDODERMAL (RP1) OR ECTODERMAL (RP2 OR CB) CIRCUITS.

   SUB-SUB TASK 1.1.2. BUILD A MAP OF GENE EXPRESSION IN HYDRA TO IDENTIFY EXPRESSED NERVE CELL GENES SPECIFIC TO SPATIALLY DEFINED REGIONS OF THE BODY COLUMN AND PARTICULAR TISSUES, I.E. ENDODERM OR ECTODERM.
 O APPROACH: WE WILL ISOLATE RNA FROM 8 DISSECTED BODY REGIONS (24 LIBRARIES, THREE REPLICATES) AND FROM THE ECTODERMAL AND ENDODERMAL TISSUES THAT INCLUDE THEIR RESPECTIVE NERVE NETS (6 LIBRARIES, THREE REPLICATES). WE WILL HAVE DEEP SEQUENCING LIBRARIES PREPARED FOR EACH OF THESE RNA SAMPLES AND HAVE THEM SEQUENCED ON THE ILLUMINA HI-SEQ4000 AT THE UC DAVIS GENOME CENTER (HTTP://DNATECH.GENOMECENTER.UCDAVIS.EDU). IN ADDITION WE WILL RE-SEQUENCE OUR PILOT LINEAGE SPECIFIC LIBRARIES (INTERSTITIAL, ENDODERMAL, AND ECTODERMAL) IN ORDER TO OBTAIN HIGHER SEQUENCING DEPTH. WE WILL COMBINE ALL OF THESE DATA TO BUILD A BINARY MAP OF GENE EXPRESSION IN HYDRA WHERE THE ENTIRE BODY IS SPLIT INTO 24 BINS (EACH CONTAINING A SUBSET OF NERVE CELLS) AND GENES ARE SCORED AS EITHER ON OR OFF IN EACH BIN. BASED ON THESE DATA WE WILL DERIVE GENE EXPRESSION MODELS USED DOWNSTREAM FOR SINGLE CELL PLACEMENT. A SUBSET OF THESE WILL BE VALIDATED BY RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION. INITIAL ANALYSIS WILL FOCUS ON THE ENDODERMAL RP2 CIRCUIT, WHICH WILL BE THE TARGET OF TEAM INVESTIGATION DURING PHASE 1.
