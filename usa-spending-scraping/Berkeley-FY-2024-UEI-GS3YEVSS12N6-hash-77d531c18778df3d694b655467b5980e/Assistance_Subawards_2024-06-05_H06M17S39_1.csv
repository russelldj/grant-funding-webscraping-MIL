 THIS GLARING TECHNOLOGY GAP OF HIGH PRIORITY TO DOD, WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A NOVEL SEMISYNTHETIC HYALURONIC ACID-BASED (HYA) HYDROGEL, CALLED VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢.
 IN THIS PROPOSAL, PROF. HEALYÂ  S LAB AT THE UC BERKELEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AIM 1, TO COMPLETE
 THE GMP MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SCALE-UP FOR VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ USE IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND AN
 FDA-REGULATED CLINICAL TRIAL. THE FIRST PILOT NON-GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (GMP)
 MANUFACTURED BATCH WILL BE PRODUCED IN GMP-LIKE CONDITIONS (AKA, GMP LITE); THIS WILL BE
 COMPLETED IN BOTH GEL AND SPONGE FORM FACTORS, STERILIZED, AND VALIDATED PHYSIOCHEMICALLY AND
 BIOLOGICALLY. PROFESSOR HEALY HAS IDENTIFIED A SITE FOR THIS WORK. ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR FOOD &
 DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) SUBMISSION WILL BE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED. ACCELERATED AND NORMAL
 STABILITY TESTING PROTOCOLS WILL BE DEVELOPED, INITIATED, AND MONITORED WITH VALIDATED METHODS. FOR
 LATE-STAGE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL USE, CGMP MATERIALS WILL BE PRODUCED AND ANALYZED UNDER GOOD
 LABORATORY PRACTICE (GLP) REGULATIONS. THE DELIVERABLE OF THIS AIM WILL BE SCALABLE GMP
 MANUFACTURING OF VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ FOR CLINICAL TRIALS. WE FULLY EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT AND VALIDATE THE
 GMP MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ AND MAKE IT READILY AVAILABLE FOR THE PROPOSED
 PRECLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES BY Q3/4 OF YEAR 1. NONETHELESS, THE GMP MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES WILL
 NEED TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE 3-YEAR COURSE OF THE PROPOSED WORK TO ENSURE READY AVAILABILITY
 FOR ALL REQUIRED PRECLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PLANNED TO SCALE-UP THE
 VOLUMATRIXÂ ¢ SPONGE FORM FACTOR MANUFACTURING FOR USE IN REGULATED HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES
 FOLLOWING FDA GUIDANCE AND ULTIMATELY CLEARANCE OR APPROVAL.
 PROF. HEALYÂ  S LAB WILL PREPARE AND PROVIDE TWO FORMS OF HYA BIOMATERIALS TO PROF. CHRIST (A
 LYOPHILIZED SPONGE AND GEL). THESE WILL BE IMPLANTED IN A MURINE VML MODEL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
 VIRGINIA AND COMPARED WITH THE ALREADY TESTED HYA HYDROGEL FORMULATION. A LYOPHILIZED SPONGE
 FORM WOULD BE EASIER TO STERILIZE, EASIER TO IMPLANT, AND TAKE LESS OPERATING ROOM TIME FOR CLINICIANS
 TO APPLY THAN AN IN SITU FORMING GEL SOLUTION. THUS, THIS STUDY IS CRITICAL TO MOVING THE PROJECT
 CLOSER TO THE CLINIC IN A SHORTER TIME.
 THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS.
 SHOULD ANY DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS RESULT FROM THIS WORK THEY WILL HAVE BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY

 MANEUVERS IN UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS. THE RESEARCH AT BERKELEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE
 FOLLOWING MAJOR TASK OF THE PROPOSAL.
 RCA 2: DISCOVER INNOVATION/LEARNING STRATEGIES IN ANIMALS.
 OBJECTIVE: EXTRACT TASK-ENVIRONMENT-BODY (TEB) REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STRATEGY SUITE ANIMALS
 USE TO MAP AND MANEUVER WITHIN THEIR UNSTRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS BY USING NEUROMECHANICALLY
 INSTRUMENTED ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH RODENTS RESPOND TO A HIGHLY CHALLENGING, COMPLEX,
 EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULABLE TERRAIN-SENSORIUM.
 APPROACH: FORAGING, AN ANIMALS KEY COGNITIVE NEUROMECHANICAL BEHAVIORAL SUITE, ILLUSTRATES THE
 DIVERSITY OF LENGTH AND TIME SCALES OVER WHICH FIT SPECIES PURSUE SURVIVAL TASKS. ANIMAL
 MORPHOLOGIES SUPPORT THESE EMBODIED PROBLEM-SOLVING CAPABILITIES THROUGH HIERARCHICAL
 INFORMATION PROCESSING AUGMENTED BY STRONG COUPLING BETWEEN HIGHLY DISTRIBUTED SENSING AND
 ACTUATION, MATERIAL PROPERTIES, AND PHYSICAL DYNAMICS. NO ENGINEERED SYSTEM HAS EVER COME CLOSE
 TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NONLINEARITY, INNOVATIVE MEMORY USE, AND SEEMING INFINITE DIMENSIONAL
 LEARNING, ADAPTATION, DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION THAT UNDERLIES SUCH EMBODIED AUTONOMY.
 WE PROPOSE A NARROW, BUT INTEGRATED FOCUS, ON KEY RANGES ALONG THIS NEWLY ACCESSIBLE,
 SWEEPING SPECTRUM OF ANIMAL LEARNING, WHEN INFORMED BY OUR TOPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRACING
 THE NATURE OF AND CONSTRAINTS ON ENERGY AND INFORMATION FLOWS, HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO BREAK OPEN
 NEW FOUNDATIONS OF MACHINE AUTONOMY. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE NEUROMECHANICS OF
 INTACT, FREE-RUNNING SPECIES (SQUIRRELS) IN ARTIFICIAL FORAGING ENVIRONMENTS WHOSE NAVIGATION
 THROUGH EXTREME MOTOR CHALLENGES (DENSELY OBSTRUCTED OR SEVERELY CRATERED PATHWAYS  THE SORT OF
 UNSTRUCTURED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CONFOUND CONTEMPORARY ROBOTICS). WE WILL
 STUDY THE HOW NOVEL AGILE MANEUVERS (E.G., SUDDEN PARKOUR GAP-CROSSING INNOVATIONS) ARISE
 ACROSS BODY TYPES (DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES IN THE SAME SPECIES) AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORIES
 (DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS WITH SIMILAR HABITAT). IN TURN, WE WILL STUDY THE HOW ANIMALS VARIED
 MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES INTERACT WITH THEIR
 NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGIES.
 WE WILL STUDY JUVENILE FOX SQUIRRELS FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, AS IN OTHER MAMMALS, TREE
 SQUIRRELS MUST DEVELOP THEIR MOTOR SKILLS IN THE COMPLEX (AND RISKY) 3D ENVIRONMENT OF THE TREE
 CANOPY. PERHAPS FOR THIS REASON, TREE SQUIRREL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SLOWER THAN
 THAT SEEN IN GROUND SQUIRRELS, SUCH AS CHIPMUNKS, WHO MOVE PRIMARILY IN 2D; TREE SQUIRRELS ALSO
 HAVE RELATIVELY LARGER BRAINS THAN GROUND SQUIRREL.
 YEAR 1-3. OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON THE FORM OF INNOVATION IN
 FOX SQUIRRELS, COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT MOTOR TASKS IN GROUPS WITH
 DIFFERENT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WILL UTILIZE THREE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE
 HYBRIDS OF KNOWN INNATE MOTOR PATTERNS (LEAPING, NUT OPENING, CACHE BURYING). BECAUSE THE
 INNATE COMPONENTS OF THESE BEHAVIORS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED, WE CAN PRECISELY IDENTIFY THE NOVEL,
 LEARNED COMPONENTS. SECOND, THESE THREE BEHAVIORS OCCUR AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES AND HENCE
 INVOLVE DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS, FROM THE SMALLEST SCALE MOVEMENTS (NUT OPENING), TO MEDIUM
 SCALE MOVEMENTS (GAP LEAPING) AND FINALLY LARGE SCALE MOVEMENTS (DISTRIBUTING CACHES). TO TEST",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W911NF1810327_2100/,2024-03-26 14:19:09+00

 CRITICAL FACTORS NEEDED IN ROBOTIC ACTUATORS. DESPITE THE PRESSING NEED FOR ACTUATORS THAT EXHIBIT ALL
 OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS, SYNTHETIC ACTUATORS DEVELOPED TO DATE TEND TO EXCEL ONLY IN A FEW OF THESE
 CATEGORIES WHILE SEVERELY LACKING IN OTHERS. IN CONTRAST, BIOLOGICAL MUSCLE EXHIBITS ALL OF THESE
 CHARACTERISTICS, AND ANIMALS DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF MUSCLE AS AN ACTUATOR FOR AGILE, NIMBLE, AND
 ADAPTABLE PERFORMANCE. THE EMERGING FIELD OF BIOHYBRID ROBOTICS SHOWS THAT RECENT ADVANCES IN
 TISSUE ENGINEERING CAN BE HARNESSED TO INTEGRATE LIVING MUSCLES IN RELATIVELY SIMPLE DEVICES.
 HOWEVER, SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES REMAIN THAT LIMIT THE SCALABILITY, LONGEVITY, CONTROL, AND
 POWER OF THESE EXISTING BIOACTUATORS. IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES HAVE
 CO-EVOLVED WITHIN THE NEUROMUSCULAR AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEMS. OUR TEAMÂ  S WORK HAS SHOWN
 THAT BIOACTUATOR PERFORMANCE IS IMPROVED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF NEURAL CONTROL CIRCUITRY, AND
 BIOACTUATOR FORCE CAN BE ENHANCED BY ALLOWING MUSCLE SELF-EXERCISE. HOWEVER, BIOHYBRID ACTUATORS
 STUDIES TO DATE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE ACTUATORS IN HIGHLY CONTROLLED LABORATORY
 SETTINGS IN WHICH ACTUATORS ARE CARED FOR DAILY TO REMOVE WASTE PRODUCTS, REPLENISH NUTRIENTS, AND
 TYPICALLY REQUIRE LARGE OFFBOARD SYSTEMS FOR STIMULATION. EVEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, EXISTING
 BIOHYBRID ACTUATORS FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE FORCE AND LONGEVITY CAPABILITIES OF IN SITU MUSCLE IN LIVING
 ORGANISMS. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THAT AN INTEGRATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH EFFORT IS NEEDED TO
 UNDERSTAND BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR INTERFACES, LIFE-SUPPORT, DESIGN, AND LOCAL CONTROL TO MOVE BIOHYBRID
 ACTUATORS BEYOND THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PETRI DISH SCALE. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF 3D
 SYNTHETIC SCAFFOLDS, LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS, ELECTRO-, AND PHOTO-NEUROMUSCULAR INTERFACES, AND LOCAL
 FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS ON BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR PERFORMANCE, ADAPTABILITY, AND LONGEVITY.
 FURTHERMORE, WE WILL VALIDATE OUR UNDERSTANDING BY INTEGRATING GENERAL PRINCIPLES FROM OUR BASIC
 RESEARCH IN BIOHYBRID ACTUATOR FABRICATION, MATURATION, INTERFACES, AND LIFE SUPPORT, WITH
 COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS DESIGN. USING THESE TOOLS, WE WILL TEST OUR UNDERSTANDING BY PREDICTING AND
 VALIDATING THE PERFORMANCE OF BIOHYBRID ACTUATORS WITH ENHANCED SCALE, LONGEVITY, AND PERFORMANCE
