        "abstract": "Ultrasensitive low light level detection and sensing in the near infrared (NIR) is critical for many military applications. Night vision devices (NVD) will greatly benefit from extremely sensitive CMOS-compatible focal plane arrays (FPAs). Current NVD intensifier technology has substantial size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, and does not lend itself to being fused with typical infrared (IR) sensors. There is an urgent demand for NIR FPA technology that can provide extreme sensitivity at low NIR light levels and allow direct integration with CMOS readout integrated circuits (ROICs). Nanohmics, Inc., teaming with Dr. Jennifer Hollingsworth at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), is developing low-SWaP, uncooled ultrasensitive NIR FPAs based on a graphene phototransistor architecture photosensitized with NIR-absorbing colloidal quantum dot (QD) nanocrystals (NCs). This architecture combines the high IR absorption of the QD thin film with the inherent device gain of graphene gated by photogenerated carriers. This gain leads to ultrahigh photoresponsivity and specific detectivity D*. These FPAs should achieve performance parity with analog night vision (NV) systems, while leveraging the advantages of digital imaging, such as compatibility with data sharing, augmented reality (AR), and machine learning (ML) for targeting. The use of graphene and QDs allows direct integration with CMOS ROICs and will enable low-cost mass production of FPAs. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the feasibility of uncooled ultrasensitive FPAs through the design, fabrication, and testing of photodetectors based on QD-sensitized graphene, operating in the spectral range 0.8-1.3 \u00b5m. The team established methods for graphene transfer, QD fabrication, graphene-QD integration, and scale-up to manufacturing. Nanohmics also designed a CMOS-based FPA prototype to be fabricated and tested during the Phase II program, and identified CMOS ROIC foundry services for initial low-cost prototyping and longer-term production scale-up. During Phase II the team will fabricate a compact, uncooled, graphene-QD FPA prototype by integrating QD-sensitized graphene photodetectors with a CMOS ROIC, achieving TRL 4. The team will increase sensitivity, spectral range, frame rate, and device ruggedness by improving the QD sensitizer, optimizing ROIC integration, and developing an encapsulation process. Graphene-CMOS integration will be addressed early in Phase II using foundry services that will provide a direct path to increasing imaging resolution and production volume while maintaining low costs \u2013 accelerating technology transition and follow-on commercialization. The Phase II IR FPA prototype will be delivered to the Army sponsor for testing and transition to an Army partner during Phase III. The FPA technology can be extended into other bands, including SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR, making it extremely valuable for a wide variety of military and civilian applications.less",

In Phase II, we plan to improve CartaBlanca performance in parallel computers and compare CartaBlanca predictions with legacy codes such as EPIC. Then we plan to perform a formal model validation of CartaBlanca by comparing its predictions with experimental data using ACTA's Nonlinear Model V&V Toolbox for projectiles penetrating metal and concrete targets.

        "abstract": "Ultrasensitive low light level detection and sensing in the near infrared (NIR) is critical for many military applications. Specifically, night vision devices (NVD) would greatly benefit from extremely sensitive CMOS-compatible focal plane arrays (FPAs) capable of detecting a signal in the NIR. Current intensifier tube technology in NVDs is bulky in size and weight, and does not lend itself to being fused with typical infrared sensors. There is an urgent need for a NIR FPA technology that can address the following two fundamental challenges: direct integration with Si-based CMOS readout integrated circuits (ROICs) and extreme sensitivity at low NIR light levels. Nanohmics, Inc. teaming with Dr. Jennifer A. Hollingsworth at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), proposes to develop uncooled ultrasensitive CMOS-based NIR FPAs based on a graphene phototransistor architecture photosensitized with NIR-absorbing semiconductor core/shell nanocrystals (NCs). This approach combines the high IR absorption of the NC thin film with the inherent device gain of graphene gated by the transfer of photogenerated carriers. This gain leads to ultrahigh photoresponsivity and specific detectivity D*. The use of graphene and colloidal NCs allows direct monolithic integration with Si-based ROICs and will enable low-cost mass production of NIR FPAs with large format and small pitch. Nanohmics has already demonstrated a preliminary NIR device operating at room temperature, which will be further optimized in this Phase I effort. In Phase I, the team will demonstrate a proof-of-concept uncooled ultrasensitive graphene-based NIR detector. The team will synthesize core/shell NCs, fabricate, and test single graphene-NC detector elements with responses in low light conditions in the NIR. The team will also develop engineering methods to design a ROIC for Phase II and demonstrate the feasibility of direct ROIC integration. The Phase II program will advance the design and performance of the proof-of-concept to improve detector-level metrics, including quantum efficiency, D*, and frame rate. Phase II will concentrate on optimization of the prototype design and monolithic integration of an appropriate array with a commercially available ROIC to form an FPA. This type of detector can be extended into other bands, including SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR. The advantages of uncooled operation of a low-cost, low-SWaP, high-speed graphene-based IR detectors will provide a multitude of market opportunities. It will be extremely valuable for a wide variety of military and civilian applications, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); border security ISR for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); chemical analysis of emissions; and detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).less",

        "abstract": "Measuring the response of explosives to a variety of thermal and mechanical inputs is important to understand and ultimately predict the reaction violence of an explosive in an accident scenario. Technically, there are many challenges to overcome in observing explosives response. For instance, secondary high explosives are heterogeneous and optically opaque and often need to be confined in metal cases. Furthermore, the reaction is typically accompanied by solid and gas products and light emission with extremes in temperature, pressure, and rate. This makes flash X-ray radiography an important probe as it can be used to image through smoke, flame, metal cases, and opaque solids. However, current flash radiography limits observation to a single image per observation axis. Single point flash measurements can provide an observation of state but not velocity. Therefore, in order to image dynamic events using X-rays, multiple flash X-ray sources are used to produce a series of X-ray images of the explosive event. The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an X-ray cinematography system for explosive events, by overcoming the limitations of current flash X-ray radiography systems. This will include new developments in hardware and software to achieve the desired goal.less",

The proposed algorithm is based on the FLIP (Fluid Implicit Particle) - MPM (Material PointMethod) - MFM (Multiphase Flow Method) approach and the CartaBlanca nonlinear solver environment developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. CartaBlanca can solve coupled problems involving (a) failure and penetration of solids, (b) heat transfer, (c)phase change, (d) chemical reactions, and (e) multiphase flow. It is designed with GUI capabilities to utilize multiple processors on a single computer or on computer clusters. It is written entirely in Java programming language, and is easily ported tomany computer platforms. In Phase I, we propose to demonstrate the capabilities of the FLIP-MPM-MFM approach by solving a classic problem where a lead bullet impacts and penetrates an aluminum plate, and compare results with experimental data. In PhaseII, we will validate the algorithm by simulating complex weapon-target interaction problems and comparing them to existing available experimental data using ACTA?s Nonlinear Model V&V Toolbox. In Phase III, we plan to use CartaBlanca to develop FastRunning Models for simulating weapon-target interaction in the Tri-Services Modular Effectiveness Vulnerability Assessment (MEVA)code. This project will result in a validated advanced computational algorithm that can be used for virtual testing ofmilitary systems for survivability and design studies. Full scale testing of weapon-target interaction problems is expensive and time consuming. In contrast, virtual testing using validated simulation software can be performed anywhere safely, quicklyand economically for multiple scenarios. Virtual testing also allows the Army to test future weapons with environments that may not be accessible for testing. Because of mesh tangling, commercially available Lagrangian codes are not suitable forsimulating the secondary debris created by impact detonation of army munitions on urban structures. The new algorithm developed by LANL overcomes these difficulties. The validated LANL code will be used to develop Fast Running Models (FRMs) that capturethe important aspects of HFPB (High Fidelity Physics Based) models. These FRMs can be used for quick assessments, including probabilistic Monte Carlo analysis, by personnel who are not computational mechanics experts.less",

        "abstract": "Because on their high current carrying capacity in large magnetic fields, biaxially oriented superconducting films (coated superconductors) are the only superconducting materials that offer the possibility of operating in power applications at liquid-nitrogen temperatures in AC fields. Their use is predicated on the assumption that ac losses in these materials can be reduced to a very low level. To do so requires the use of innovative conductor geometries. Present superconductor loss theory is inadequate for predicting the loss in coated superconductors with these geometries under realistic conditions found in generators and transformers. New loss theory is required. This Phase I program will develop new ac loss models for coated superconductors. The program will: (a) extend ac loss theory to apply to coated conductors, (b) develop practical conductor geometries which minimize ac losses under conditions which exist in generators and transformers, (c) investigate generator and transformer designs which best take advantage of coated conductors, and (d) prepare a test plan for a Phase II demonstration of loss prediction and conductor performance in a short sample of YBCO and in a USAF generator presently under construction. The advanced ac loss models developed in this Phase I program and the novel new HTS coated superconductor geometries developed to minimize the combined transport current and applied magnetic field losses in these new conductors will allow us to determine if coated conductors can function at high temperatures in emerging AC hardware. The development of these analytical models and conductor geometries will be essential to the successful application of these HTS conductors to the lightweight generators and transformers that are needed for military (and ultimately commercial) applications of superconducting hardware.less",

Therefore, although Monte Carlo shells that re-run calculations many times while varying input values according to specified distributions are useful, they are insufficient to properly account for epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Three things are needed to build on the new consensus. The first is a clear and comprehensive roadmap for how various important problems (e.g., arithmetic and logical evaluations, backcalculations, sensitivity analyses, etc.) can be solved under this view. The second is software that enables analysts to automatically propagate through simulations the uncertainty implied by the significant digits of the numbers specifying a model. Such software would require very little training in uncertainty analysis to be useful to analysts. The third need is a software library of recommended methods for common calculations that is usable by modelers and analysts who may not themselves be experts in uncertainty quantification but who recognize the need for and benefits from it.less",

The proposed noncontact technique is based on TRA focusing of high frequency vibrations in tested structures produced by single or several external sources and surface vibration measurements by a scanning laser vibrometer. The application of TRA principles will significantly improve the vibration based NDE system's ability to detect the presence of structural faults and localize damage due to targeted focusing of the acousto-elastic waves. In contrast to conventional acoustic methods of NDE where the dispersion of elastic waves is viewed as an unfavorable phenomena, the TRA methodology takes advantage of this previously undesirable process. Scanning of the TRA focused signal over examined surface provides information necessary for tomographic mapping of damage and degradation. During Phase I, the principles of the TRA system with external sources and a laser vibrometer for damage detection will be developed and feasibility tests will be conducted on composite and metal parts with increasing level of damage including cracks, delamination, fiber breakage, corrosion, and battle damage. The developed TRA software and hardware will form a basis for the prototype that will be built in Phase II.less",

Solar cells have historically been heavy, costly, and inflexible. In this research, low-cost manufacturing methods will be used to make high efficiency (~20%) solar cells that are extremely lightweight. To achieve these goals, we turn to the perovskite halide solar cell materials, which have shown remarkable progress in the past six years as solution processable, low-cost solar cell materials that nonetheless exhibit high efficiencies. Among existing solar cell technologies, the perovskite halides present one of the most promising technologies for achieving efficiencies in excess of 20% at suitable costs and in a lightweight form factor because they are grown in thin film form, minimizing the material. In this proposal, we will explore two different methods of growing perovskite halide based solar cells: hot-casting of solutions, and physical vapor deposition. The approaches will be evaluated based on the efficiency of the resultant cell, the scalability of the manufacturing process, flexibility and the cost.

Current approaches rely almost entirely on end-user analytics, which is inefficient in that it requires raw data to reach the analysts from distant nodes of the GIG before information is extracted. The proposed effort overcomes this issue, both saving limited bandwidth and improving analytic efficiency by extracting information close to the source. We apply concepts of both compressive sensing (CS) and compressive processing (CP) to the information-generating chain that flows from the sensor through the GIG to analytical resources, and then back to the GIG as a product. Objective, quantitative means are used to optimize state-of-the-art CS and CP services deployed at locations throughout the distributed sensor-GIG-analyst network.
