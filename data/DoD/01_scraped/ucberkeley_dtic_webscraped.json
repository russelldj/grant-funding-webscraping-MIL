        "abstract": "We propose to design, fabricate, and benchmark planar 2D superconducting processors with = 8 qubits and 2-qubit gate fidelities = 0.99. We leverage a toolbox containing submicron Josephson junctions/arrays and high-coherence, passive microwave circuit elements including capacitors, superinductors, and co-planar waveguide resonators. Our approach does not rely on circuit elements for which robust fabrication techniques have not been developed (eg. phase-slip elements and cos(2\u00c0) elements) or qubit architectures where a clear route to logical gate operation has not been proven (eg. 0-p or other topological qubits). We adjust the ratios of EJ/EC and EJ/EL to realize two unexplored noise-resilient qubits: The High-Coherence Fluxonium that encodes quantum information in matter and the Multi-Photon Cat where, in the presence of an intense 2-photon microwave drive, information is encoded in photonic degrees of freedom. We have thoroughly simulated both designs and have also fabricated proof-of-concept devices. We will (i) pair these next-generation matter and photonic superconducting 2D circuits with a robust, high-fidelity CZ gate (originally developed for transmons in the HiPS program); (ii) quantify and mitigate decoherence due to dielectric loss and non-equilibrium quasiparticles, integrating our recently demonstrated Q > 5M Nb co-planar resonators into qubit circuits and establishing coherence limits due to these mechanisms; (iii) use charge-sensitive sensor qubits for characterizing correlated quasiparticle errors; (iv) mitigate quasiparticle losses by fabricating circuitry on suspended membranes; (v) use both quantum-information and condensed matter methods to characterize many-body noise processes\u00d1including correlated logical errors\u00d1in a multi-qubit processor; and (vi) execute standard quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform to validate quantum processor performance. Our integrated theory effort will support and extend these experimental efforts. We will (i) optimize gate performance and qubit lifetimes using machine learning techniques and realistic models of the environmental noise and drive cross-talk; (ii) optimize readout fidelity by accounting for nonidealities such as memory effects and basis hybridization; (iii) characterize and model the environmental noise by mapping its spectral density using correlated sensor-qubit data; and, (iv) study and develop protocols to mitigate sources of dynamical dephasing. For High-Coherence Fluxonium qubits, we will (i) simulate 2-qubit gates with a charge multi-path coupler; (ii) explore implementations of the 2-qubit fSim gate family that includes CZ and iSWAP as special cases; and (iii) design tunable 2-qubit gates that use both charge and flux couplers, as well as multi-path interference. For Multi-Photon Cat qubits, we will (i) model coherence limitations and analyze alternate circuit designs that address those limitations; (ii) design faster, noise-biased single-qubit gates; and, (iii) explore novel interactions suitable for implementing multi-qubit gates. We will also close the loop in the qubit design innovation chain by correlating the following: materials imperfections, measured coherence, logical gate fidelities, measured noise-spectra, and error reconstruction based on quantum verification/validation protocols. This is a fundamental research project that is not expected to produce any developmental items. Should any developmental items result from this work they will have both civilian and military applications.less",

        "abstract": "The proposed research aims at optimizing three types of two-qubit quantum logical gates in a planar superconducting transmon processor: the cross-resonance gate, the geometric phase gate (M\u00bflmer-S\u00bfrensen Gate), and the controlled phase gate (Zeno gate). The first is implemented via microwave irradiation of one qubit at the excitation frequency of its capacitively coupled neighbor. With improvements in coherence times at the level of 100 \u00c0\u00c0s and beyond, and quantum control methods to suppress spurious couplings. These improvements will take us from our current value of 93.7% two-qubit gate fidelity to an ultimate operation fidelity of 99.9%. The two other proposed gates are novel circuits which, on the basis of preliminary numerical simulations, are predicted to exhibit raw fidelities in excess of 90%. A research focus is to demonstrate the first realization of these gates, followed by subsequent optimization to achieve fidelities at the 99% level. The geometric phase gate developed is a novel superconducting qubit implementation of the M\u00bflmer-S\u00bfrenson gate\u00d1a work horse in the atomic physics community\u00d1based on the generation of cavity mediated coupling between two transmon qubits using additional microwave sideband drive tones, analogous to the laser light induced mechanically mediated coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom of ions in a Paul trap. Finally, using extensions of the quantum Zeno effect, we propose a new controlled phase gate in which the higher levels of the transmon are excited and strongly measured to inhibit certain inter-level transitions, effectively inducing a \"pi\" phase shift on a target two-qubit state. Improvements to superconducting quantum processor hardware include the design and integration of multiple stages of frequency specific Purcell filtering to permit the strong coupling of control lines to qubits, thereby minimizing crosstalk, without a significant increase in environment induced decoherence. Additionally, quasiparticle reduction techniques based on engineering the on-chip phonon density of states will be incorporated into multi-qubit chips. These designs modifications will be co-introduced with materials improvements targeting the removal and passivation of lossy surface dielectric layers introduced at each step of the qubit fabrication process. To further enhance performance, quantum control methods to (i) optimize drive pulses utilizing gradient based routines and machine learning algorithms, (ii) suppress crosstalk and spurious operating frequency shifts using dynamical decoupling sequences, and (iii) randomly compile gate sequences to suppress coherent errors will be developed and implemented. Finally, to diagnose the performance of the quantum processes described, extensions of randomized benchmarking techniques which yield information about specific noise models and consider coherent and non-Markovian effects are proposed for evaluation. In addition to these projective measurement based routines, simultaneous, continuous measurements of two coupled qubits will be performed to diagnose the onset of gate infidelity, particularly targeting correlated errors.less",

Bioremediation using bacteria, protein binders and enzymes are proven effective, but are not suitable for in-field application due to poor stability. Recently, we demonstrated that by encoding statistic pattern of monomer distribution in random heteropolymers (RHPs), it is feasible to generate polymers mimicking intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). RHPs succeed in stabilizing proteins in non-native environment, assisting protein folding during translation, and fabrication of enzyme-containing fabrics for in-field organophosphorus degradation in both aqueous and organic solvents. In nature, abundant IDPs are found to catalyze reactions and bind substrate for signal transduction.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Developing countries around the world increasingly face violent irregular threats in the form of insurgency and terrorism. Many developing countries, however, have proven unable to effectively deploy their security institutions, military and civilian, in responding to those threats. The problem for U.S. policymakers and military planners is that existing research cannot explain much of the cross-national variation in the performance of security institutions in tackling violent irregular threats. The Program on Security Institutions and Violent Instability seeks to advance our understanding of how the design of security institutions (e.g., military, police, paramilitary, militia) can affect the capacity of countries to combat violent irregular threats. We specifically propose to assess how the institutional features of state security forces, including structure factors (such as inter-service coordination rules) and system factors (such as promotion policies), shape their ability to undertake sustained counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns. We will examine how such institutional differences influence whether countries can deter the onset of violent irregular threats, defeat existing violent groups, reduce the number of civilian and combatant deaths, and increase the duration of periods without violent activity. The Program on Security Institutions and Violent Instability will pursue its research objectives through a multi-method approach. First, we propose to assemble and statistically analyze a cross-national Domestic Security Institutions (DSI) database with systematically coded information on security institutions and their inter-service relationships. Second, we propose to produce paired case studies of six countries that share a common set of threats, but exhibit considerable variation in their success combating those threats: Colombia and Mexico; Ethiopia and Nigeria; and Burma/Myanmar and the Philippines. Third, we propose to conduct a survey of security personnel in the Philippines, where multiple types of security institutions have been employed in combatting insurgency and terrorism with varying degrees of success. This study will have direct implications for U.S. defense missions across command regions and across services. By accounting empirically for differences in the performance of critical security institutions, this project will contribute to the development of objective diagnostic metrics for anticipating how partner countries, particularly in fragile and transitional states, might respond to the outbreak of insurgency or the emergence of a terrorist network within its borders. Additionally, the data and analysis generated by this project will enable policymakers and military planners to better target security sector assistance and reform programs to the institutions within partner countries most likely to respond positively.less",

Mission planners can be aided by initial and ongoing situation assessment, future state estimation, assessment of the current plan\"s probability of success, what-if analysis, and suggestions for decisions. At present, few automated tools exist to provide mission planners with the required information. An automated tool to assist mission planners must deal with both the inherent uncertainty and the complexity of the situation. Charles River Analytics proposes a system for Probabilistic and Relational Inferences in Dynamic Environments (PRIDE), an approach based on probabilistic relational models (PRMs). PRMs use probabilities to handle uncertainty while capturing the logical and relational structure of a situation to handle complexity. We base our implementation of PRMs on probabilistic programming (PP), which provides a powerful and flexible way to represent probabilistic models using the power of programming languages. We propose to design and develop a full-fledged prototype of our PRM and PP engine, to design and develop temporal reasoning capabilities, and to design and develop decision-theoretic reasoning capabilities.less",

Individual genome sequencing will soon be routine and cost-effective.  To exploit this resource to the benefit of warfighters, we propose an approach for identifying and characterizing genetic variants that compromise metabolic efficiency (and ultimately physical and cognitive performance) yet are amenable to nutritional optimization.  There are 600+ cofactor-dependent enzymes in the human proteome, and preliminary studies provide ample precedence for the remediation of dysfunctional enzyme variants by simple vitamin/mineral supplementation. We describe a technology platform in which all possible enzyme variants are functionally assessed and pre-determined for each enzyme/gene.  These datasets will serve to rapidly identify carriers of variant enzymes who can metabolically benefit from cofactor supplementation.  In Phase I, the key technical aspects of the approach have been validated.  These include:  1) generating comprehensive variant libraries of target genes through a simple, minimal-step process for functional testing, and 2) assessing function of all possible single-nucleotide variants simultaneously by quantitative complementation in a model organism (the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae).  The validation of these processes makes gene atlas generation achievable at a scale large enough to provide meaningful data for genome interpretation.  In a first-use scenario, these studies will facilitate Phase II efforts to query all genes (N = 13) related to clearance of homocysteine, an intermediary metabolite in methionine/one-carbon pathways.  Elevated homocysteine levels can have adverse effects on physical performance and cardio-respiratory fitness, though the metabolic steps surrounding homocysteine are amenable to nutritional \u201ctuning\u201d.  Specifically, we will define the functional impact of all possible single-nucleotide changes within this metabolic cassette to serve as an information resource used to identify at-risk individuals.  These finding will spur a field trial in which individual genotype and metabolite profile are diagnostic for potential performance enhancement, as well as define a first product for subsequent commercialization.  This pioneering work will render genome sequence an asset to improve health, fitness and readiness.less",

While the equations of motion governing these dynamics have been known for almost a century, solving them in full generality is simply too difficult. Fortunately, a combination of analytic, numerical and experimental progress has led to the development of insights and tools that bridge the gap between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic quantum behavior. These insights suggest a remarkable proposition: that out-of-equilibrium systems can stabilize many-body entanglement and exhibit phenomena fundamentally richer than their static counterparts. However, predicting and measuring the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central open challenge in physics. Part of this challenge stems from the fact that many-body systems can be taken out of equilibrium in a variety of different ways, each with its own set of expectations and guiding intuition. Among others, this plenitude of non-equilibrium strategies include: periodic driving, prethermalization, strong disorder, quantum quenches, and dissipation. To this end, the overarching goal of this proposal is to explore quantum phenomena, which can only be realized via the cooperative synergy between multiple non-equilibrium techniques. In particular, we propose to investigate two intertwined questions: first, what are the novel types of emergent quantum order that can arise in systems, which exhibit a combination of disorder, driving, and dissipation. And second, how do the microscopic dynamics of quantum information in such systems lead to late-time, macroscopic steady-states. We will address these long-standing questions by developing: 1) analytical techniques which bound the speed-limit for quantum information flow, 2) massively-parallel computational methods which enable large-scale quantum dynamics simulations, and 3) a novel experimental platform composed of two different species of strongly-interacting spin-defects in the solid-state. In addition to answering fundamental questions in the broad landscape of quantum physics, our results will directly impact a number of applications - such as quantum metrology, computing, and communication - which rely upon the production, preservation, and manipulation of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems.less",

        "abstract": "This projects supports the development of a new approach to trapped-atom interferometry, named quantum adiabatic interferometry, and its application toward precise sensing of acceleration, rotation, and other effects. The project is divided into three main tasks. First, project researchers will develop advanced optical systems for producing optical box potentials, in which atoms are trapped in a dark, un-illuminated volume, while being surrounded with a \"wall\" of high intensity light. When this light is blue-detuned from atomic transitions, these walls confine the atoms in the dark volume, within which they experience no potential energy variations or other disturbances from the trapping light. A goal of this task is to produce box potentials with high contrast of light intensity between the trapping volume and the optical walls, to confirm that optical trapping can be performed with light close to atomic resonance, thereby reducing the optical power requirements, and to develop optical systems with a small footprint in terms of size, weight and power. A second task is to provide a near-perfect microgravity environment for trapped atoms within stationary on-Earth setups. For this, a precise electromagnet set, to provide a magnetic field gradient whose force on atoms cancels the gravitational force, will be modeled, wound, tested, and demonstrated to produce residual accelerations at the micro-g level. The third task is to demonstrate long-lived coherence in a box-trap atom interferometer, in which a quantum-coherent gas of atoms is adiabatically divided into two separate containers, allowed to evolve freely for variable time, and then used for phase-sensitive matter-wave interference. An overall goal of the project is to demonstrate all the necessary techniques and principles to use quantum adiabatic interferometers for inertial sensing.less",

The specifi c aim of this project is to create an ultracold, quantum degenerate gas of titanium atoms. A scheme is proposed wherein titanium atoms are excited to a metastable state, the a5F5 atomic state. Two closed optical transitions are identified, at wavelengths near 498 and 1040 nm, that permit the application of standard laser-cooling methods to metastable titanium atoms. A four-phase research effort is outlined, with the goals of (1) assembling and testing a titanium atomic beam apparatus, and applying optical pumping to prepare atoms in the a5F5 state, (2) Zeeman slowing and magneto-optical trapping of titanium atoms in the metastable state, (3) magnetic or optical trapping of atoms in the metastable state or in one of the fine-structure states of the a3F electronic ground level, and (4) preparation of quantum degenerate gases in the fine-structure ground state. Success in this project will open the door to new scientifi c directions, such as the study of ultracold gases in mixtures of different angular-momentum states and subject to polarization-dependent off-resonant light fields, the study of long-lived spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases and their possible topological low-energy phases, new variations on atom interferometry enabled by the polarization-dependent optical interactions and the plethora of metastable states in the titanium spectrum, and the study of stable spin-2 spinor Bose-Einstein condensates.
