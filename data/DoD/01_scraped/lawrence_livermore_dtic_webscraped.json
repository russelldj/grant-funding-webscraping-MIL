The complexity of this reaction makes it difficult to have insight into the reaction and to improve it. Additionally, several of the intermediates and reaction byproducts are challenging to analyze with typical analytical techniques.

Our primary approach to this problem will be to use powder bed binder printing techniques to print reactive structures. The anticipated feedstock will consist of composite particles containing all reactant species. Each printed particle can act as its own chemical cell, negating the need for particle-to-particle diffusion of reactants. Because structural integrity is a goal of this proposed work, an infiltrate will be utilized to fill voids and reinforce the printed structure. The initial focus will be on melt infiltrating the structure with solders or brazing alloys. Their low melting temperatures allow infiltration without diminishing the stored chemical energy in the printed reactive material. Reactive payloads formed by additive manufacturing can improve the payload effect/mass ratio by replacing structural elements in the munition that would otherwise be inert. In the future, we anticipate additive manufacturing may be able to create new, highly-controllable and tailored payload effects that would not be possible with traditional munitions. The program will focus on demonstrating the fundamental building blocks and techniques that can facilitate this development process.less",

        "abstract": "Radiative transfer is of special importance in several applications from re-entry flows to rocket engines and air-breathing engines. Solution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), which is a complex integro-differential equation, places stringent requirements on the computational resources. Additionally, radiative transfer can occur over widely differing spatial scales further increasing the computational complexity. Hence efforts have to be made to develop efficient numerical algorithms and solvers to address issues of accuracy and computational time. Furthermore, there is a need to develop accurate physical models that include real gas effects such as non-ideal equations of state and frequency-dependent radiative properties for the participating medium. In this research, HyPerComp proposes to develop a high-performance, multi-physics, multi-scale computational platform to address a large class of problems involving radiative transfer. PWRFlow, an in-house unstructured, parallel continuum flow solver currently solves the RTE for turbulent reacting flows. This capability will be extended to solve the RTE from the optically thin to thick limits. Use of computationally efficient hybrid methods and accurate physical models will be developed as a part of this research effort. BENEFIT: The main focus of this STTR is to develop an understanding of the role of multi-scale radiative transport in turbulent reacting flows. Work done under this research will have applications in several technologies critical in aerospace propulsion, automobile engines and plasma processing reactors. Additionally, manufacturers of gas turbines and combustors along with the energy industry using coal/oil-fired furnaces will benefit from this research. HyPerComp envisions the development of a commercial suite of software tools to assist in combustion-based applications for general propulsive and chemical engineering applications. It is anticipated that such a commercial tool will be ready for marketing on the successful completion of Phase II of this STTR.less",

The structural requirements for the targets utilized impose a severe cost and lead time burden due to the limitations imposed by the traditional manufacturing processes currently used. Novel manufacturing methods for metal alloys have been established in the past years, but they have yet to be incorporated into the DoDs target manufacturing supply chain. Our extensive experience with powder consolidation, parts manufacturing and additive manufacturing (AM) has led us to identify a combination of technologies to rapidly produce the required test items at a fraction of the current cost. We thus believe that 3D printing holds the potential for the production of printed green parts suitable for microwave (MW) sintering to consolidate them into materials of near theoretical density and strength. Our proposal will outline the advantages and limitations of each method, a robust work plan to address the current challenge and a solution to provide an expedited and low-cost manufacturing process for MDAs lethality articles. Beyond this specific application, we foresee a market in specialized industrial parts where the machining costs are elevated, all of which MATSYS will become a commercial supplier.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)less",

The high surface area to mass ratio of the foils makes them flutter after being ejected from the aircraft, taking on the appearance of a moving hot cloud when several decoys are ejected in rapid succession. The current production process relies heavily on the use of hot caustic and toxic leaching solutions to prepare the high surface area, porous, pyrophoric iron metal. These solutions are corrosive and represent both a safety and environmental hazard.The objective of this SERDP Exploratory Development (SEED) project was to demonstrate use of the \"sol-gel\" methodology for producing nanostructured energetic materials (i.e., pyrotechnics), while minimizing or eliminating the human health and environmental hazards associated with their current fabrication process. Application of this technique to the manufacture of pyrophoric flares will eliminate the need for caustic and toxic leaching solutions and improve performance of the final products.less",

Distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrid technologies can address this need by diversifying energy supply and operational requirements, as well as reducing interconnected infrastructure dependencies.

Additionally, whenever new devices are installed into the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) at DOD facilities, they are inventoried and evaluated as part of the DOD Risk Management Framework (RMF), which can be a time-consuming and onerous process. This demonstration project, CINDER, will address these issues by streamlining ICS analysis in the RMF specific to DER management systems for the energy managers and civil works leaders for DOD facilities, enabling faster authorization and full integration. It will also allow for the automation of accurate asset inventories at secure locations for Operational Technologies (OT), and provide rapid assessment of assets on the communication network, the baseline setting, and design of appropriate controls.less",

China currently controls the REE supply chain, which hinders growth of renewable energy technologies in the U.S. and Europe and creates risk in defense industry supply chains. Rare earth production schemes from both primary ores and secondary sources involve a series of chemically intense and environmentally taxing procedures with separating individual REEs from each other representing the most challenging steps. Solvent extraction, while effective for industrial scale operations, is not effective for low-grade feedstock and poses a severe environmental burden. Ion exchange chromatography presents an alternative approach for achieving high-purity REEs but is generally cost-prohibitive for scaling. The goal of this project is to develop novel REE-binding ligands coupled with materials design to enable cost-effective and organic solvent\u2013free REE recovery and separation from electronic wastes (E-wastes). If successful, the project expects to achieve REE separation with efficiency similar to traditional ion exchange chromatography but with reduced cost and environmental footprint.less",
