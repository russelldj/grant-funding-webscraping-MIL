0,Leapfrog: Learn and Prune Features in Binary Programs,United States Department of the Navy,to Heng Yin,"As software systems keep evolving, we have witnessed that modern software is increasingly complex and bloated. Aprimary reason for"""" this phenomenon is because current software engineering practices, such as object-orientedprogramming and code reuse, introduce la""""yers of abstractions.

0,One-Dimensional Quantum Materials,United States Department of the Navy,to ALexandar Balandin,"Overview and problem statement: This project will create a new comprehensive research field of one-dimensional (1D) quantum materials consisting of individual atomic chains and few-chain threads of van-der-Waals (vdW) materials, and composites comprised of bulk polymer matrix with 1D atomic chain fillers. Thereby, it will shift the current paradigm by taking one step down in dimensionality from 2D vdW materials, and creating truly 1D quantum materials. The proposed research focuses on unfettered, beyond-conventional approaches to the discovery of materials that exhibit previously unattainable functionalities. Limited experimental work is available only for bundles of atomic chains of such 1D vdW materials, suggesting extraordinary electrical current densities and unusual electron-phonon coupling. Computational machine learning studies indicate that there are hundreds of vdW materials with true-1D or quasi-1D crystalline structures consisting of 1D atomic threads weakly bound in bundles. Exfoliated to a few-chain atomic threads, these materials become genuinely quantum: owing to their atomic scale dimensions and atomically sharp interfaces, the electron states are quantum confined; in addition, many of 1D vdW materials are strongly-correlated quantum systems, which reveal non-trivial quantum phenomena, such as charge-density-wave (CDW) condensate phases, magnetic phases, superconductivity, strong spin orbit coupling, and non-trivial topology. Project goals and objectives: We propose to perform a comprehensive study of 1D quantum materials with the goals of understanding the limits of downscaling of 1D vdW crystals; fine tuning electron and phonon transport, quasi-particle interactions; and controlling strongly correlated quantum phenomena in 1D materials. We anticipate discoveries of unique electronic, thermal, and optical properties of 1D quantum materials, resulting from the ultimate quantum confinement of elemental excitations and collective quantum states. We will apply perspectives from physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering to provide high-payoff research results. Project objectives include: 1) exfoliating 1D vdW materials down to the ultimate single-atomic chain limit; 2) determining the electrical, thermal, magnetic, and optical characteristics of 1D materials; 3) establishing the electrical control of these characteristics; and 4) understanding and engineering the properties of quantum composites comprised of the polymer matrix and 1D vdW fillers. Innovative technical approaches include nanofabrication of capped and suspended 1D vdW devices to study single quantum phase-slip events; electronic “noise spectroscopy” for monitoring CDW and magnetic phase transitions; Brillouin-Mandelstam-Raman spectroscopy of confined elemental excitations; polarization photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons; thermal bridge measurements of heat conduction properties; and electromagnetic testing of dielectric constants of composites with 1D vdW fillers. The experimental research will be supported by the world-class ab-initio theory. Anticipated project outcomes and impact on DoD capabilities: The long-term outcomes of this project will create a foundation for the new class of 1D quantum materials and composites based on such materials with numerous potential applications to DoD scientific priorities and operational needs. The proposed 1D vdW quantum materials will lead to revolutionary innovations in the electronics, sensors, and energy conversion, areas which are of importance to DoD. These materials will impact the DoD capabilities in low-power memory and logic, nanoelectronics, antenna design and communications, as well as energy conversion and thermal management. Additionally, this project will educate and train researchers for the defense workforce at a University with a rare combination of being an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution and a highly ranked research-intensive institless","2,999,458",2021,2026
0,Identifying Host Pathways Important to Protective Immunity Against CCHFV,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Scott Pegan,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are a group of viral diseases representing persistent threats to the national defense of the U.S. due to their lethality, potential for weaponization and endemic nature to areas of U.S. strategic interest.

0,Quantitative and Mechanistic Analyses of Bond Selective Chemistry via Non-Thermal Excitation of Metal Nanostructures,United States Department of the Army,to Lorenzo Mangolini,"In this project we will utilize a comprehensive and combined experimental-computational approach to develop mechanistic descriptions of catalysis by metal nanostructures when excited via a non-thermal energy sources (photons, electrons and ions). The overall objective is to mechanistically characterize the most efficient and bond-selective selective approaches for driving chemical conversion processes at metal nanoparticle surfaces through non-thermal excitation mechanisms. A few common metal nanostructures (Ag, Pt, Ru nanoparticles) and extensively studied chemical systems (NO, CO, N2, CH4, and CH3OH desorption and dissociation) will be studied under non-thermal excitation conditions - using photon or electron excitation - or their combination (using a non-thermal low-temperature plasma excitation). There is a mounting body of scientific evidence suggesting that such mechanisms can provide improvements with respect to both yield and reaction selectivity for catalytic reactions on nanostructured metal surfaces, but further developments will only be accessible once a fundamental understanding of chemical reaction induced by non-thermal excitation of metal nanostructures is reached. Carefully designed experiments will be conducted to investigate the reactivity of metal nanostructures under photon irradiation and e-beam exposure. A non-thermal plasma reactor will be used to investigate their reactivity under the more complex scenario in which multiple non-thermal excitation processes are simultaneously occurring. Finally, a combination of ab-initio, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, and time-dependent density functional theory calculations to complement experiments will be used to gain a fundamental, theoretical understanding of the processes under investigation. By correlating these findings with theoretical analysis of the non-thermal chemical processes, we expected to develop henomenological insights into properties of molecules, metals, and excitation sources that are critical for enabling bond selective chemistry in non-thermal processes on metal nanostructure surfaces.less","1,975,000",2017,2020
0,"Analysis, Design, and Operation of Resilient Networks Against Localized, Strategic, and Dynamic Adversaries",United States Air Force,to Fabio Pasqualetti,"Dynamic networks are critical in multiple operating theaters of interest to the U.S. Air Force. These distributed systems have achieved great levels of autonomy, which guarantee success under nominal operating conditions in different time critical missions. Unfortunately, despite recent efforts to characterize attack vectors and countermeasures, research studies and real world incidents have demonstrated how capable adversaries can severely disrupt the operation of dynamic networks, thereby questioning their resiliency to operate in uncertain and adversarial environments. Novel theories and tools are critically needed to guarantee resiliency of dynamic networks, where both the network protocols and the attack strategy adapt over time as in an intricate game. In this project we characterize vulnerabilities of dynamic networks to attackers with different capabilities, knowledge, and objectives, and design rigorous methods to protect dynamic networks and adapt them to ensure resiliency to attacks. In particular, the PIs will (i) characterize fundamental resiliency limitations of networks against partially informed attackers, (ii) design topology adaptation algorithms to enhance resiliency of dynamic networks, and (iii) design strategies for the network operator to detect and adapt to adversaries. This project will undertake a rigorous approach based on dynamics, control, graph, and game theories, and will validate the findings through simulations and experiments with state of the art facilities. In addition to allowing the deployment of reliable networks and distributed systems in hostile environments, the theories and methods developed in this project will have far reaching implications and applicability across science and engineering, including medical, automotive, and energy sectors, as already demonstrated by the PIs' work.less","1,499,113",2019,2022
0,"Integrated Perception and Planning in Resilient Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent Networks",United States Department of the Navy,to Amit Roy Chowdhury,"Principal Investigator: Amit Roy-Chowdhury, University of California, RiversideThis project will focus on foundational principles to enable integrated sensing and analysis in large multi-modal, multi-agent networks with weak supervision, leading to reliable decision-making in complex, dynamic and uncertain environments while being resilient to adversarial interactions. This will be achieved through two broad research objectives: A) learning multi-agent, multi-modal data association models with limited supervision, and B) reliable decision-making in collaborative, decentralized teams. We will build upon existing low-level feature extraction and classification methods, and focus onthe high-level machine learning and decision making processes. Obj. A will be achieved through three tasks. First, we will show how data association modelsbetween multiple visual sensors can be learned with a small fraction of the labeling cost in current methods by taking into account the global characteristics of the multi-agent network (A1). Associations across modalities can also be learned with limited supervision by leveraging upon side information, possibly from the web; the challenge is to identify the most relevant side information (A2). The models need to be updated over time based on their performance. Information-theoretic methods for selecting the most informative samples will be used for model update, and sparse and low-rank structures inherent in the data will be exploited (A3). Obj. B will build upon the models learned in Obj. A to identify the portions most relevant to a task considering the correlations in the information between various sensors and modalities (B1). B2 will focus on identifying adversarial attacks on the data, first with known dynamical models offeature evolution to set performance bounds, followed by the more practical situation where models are only partially known. B3 closes the loop between perception and planning by acquiring the data that maximizes performance of the analysis modules. The proposed research builds upon recent advances in computer vision, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, and controls. The team of PIs reflects this blend of expertise. All the tasks will involve solid theoretical analysis and algorithm development focusing on optimizationstrategies, computational complexity, and performance bounds, and will be complemented with a rigorous evaluation phase for individual tasks, as well as their integration. Our existing facilities, along with equipment purchased through two new DURIP grants, will enable the experimental evaluation. The results will be presented in top-tier international conferences and journals, as well as in reports and presentations to the sponsor. The project directly addresses the need for understanding an environment from large volumes of heterogeneous streaming data collected by a team of autonomous agents. This has important Naval applications in field operations ranging from national security to disaster response. Our proposed methods will enable continuous and efficient learning of models that represent the data across sensors and modalities without the need for strong supervision, making decisions about the most task-relevant portions of the data along with detection of any adversarial attacks, and collaborative planning to acquire additional data to maximize the decision making accuracy. Overall, the project addresses some of the fundamental limitations of current autonomous systems by requiring only limited supervision, having the ability to identify relevant and reliable portions of large data volumes, and integrating the analysis and acquisition phasesless","1,200,000",2019,2023
0,PECASE: MICROFLUIDIC PHOTOBIOLOGY MICROSCOPY OF LIGHT HARVESTING BACTERIA AT THE SINGLE CELL LIMIT,United States Air Force,to Nathaniel Gabor,"Photosynthesis is remarkable, achieving nearly perfect light harvesting efficiency in spite of dynamic light conditions, rapidly fluctuating molecular structure, and highly intricate energy transfer pathways. Yet, it remains unknown whether there exists a fundamental organizing principle that gives rise to robust photosynthetic light harvesting. Here, we predict that light harvesting antennae can be finely tuned to maximize power conversion efficiency by passively minimizing excitation noise, thus providing a unified theoretical basis for the experimentally observed wavelength dependence of light absorption in green plants, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria. The research objectives of this proposal are two-fold: First, we propose to fabricate and characterize a novel microscope capable of measuring growth dynamics of light harvesting bacteria at the single cell limit. Second, by combining strong synergy between experiment and theory, we will use this microscope to achieve our main scientific and technical objectives: (I) demonstrate massively parallel high throughput microfluidic arrays for real-time, high data-density measurements of bacterial growth in light, (II) demonstrate a robust paradigm for photosynthetic efficiency and explore bacterial growth using data-intensive video imaging and single cell recognition, and (III) demonstrate a new optical multi-band correlation spectroscopy technique to examine the physics of noisy antennae in the light harvesting network of photosynthetic bacteria. We anticipate that measurements conducted using the proposed apparatus – the Ultra-Parallelized Microfluidic Photobiology Microscope - will give remarkably rich insight into microbial processes under illumination. In its simplest form, we will gain precise control of optical excitation at the single cell level. Our work focuses on exposing basic operating principles in complex biological networks, a burgeoning field of study that bridges physics, biology, and chemistry. No current field of research utilizes the synergistic approaches here, and the expected impact of our work may upend the current state of knowledge of light sensing in biosystems.less","1,000,000",2020,2025

0,Training from Undergraduate through Navy Engagement (TUNE),United States Department of the Navy,to Marko Princevac,"This project will connect the Navy’s ongoing need for a larger and more diverse science and engineering workforce with the State of California’s strategic plan to encourage young people to begin their postsecondary careers at community colleges and then transfer to four-year institutions. The University of California, Riverside (UCR) – one of America’s few accredited research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions (OPEID-00131600) – has active programs in partnership with nearby community colleges that enable students to transfer and complete a bachelor’s degree in science or engineering in four years. This project will expand on those efforts to enlarge and sustain the pipeline with a series of services to students that begin in the first year of college and continue beyond their transfer to UCR. These will include academic advising, tutoring, engagement with professional engineering organizations, events and lectures, and undergraduate research opportunities at UCR. Students will build expertise and enthusiasm in many areas of engineering that are important to the Navy by participating in UCR research projects (many of which are supported by the Office of Naval Research or other Navy organizations) and in-classroom exercises that allow for independent discovery and innovation. A major strength of this project is its foundation on well-established approaches and relationships, based on the literature and on our experiences over several years. It builds on projects that have been successful, but that have operated only intermittently, rising and falling with the availability of grants from various sources. Now, with California’s new emphasis on the postsecondary transfer pipeline, we will be able to solidify our relationships with community colleges in the region under support from this ONR program and sustain these programs for long-term benefits. The outcome will be a steady flow of students from Southern California community colleges (all of which are also accredited Hispanic Serving Institutions) to UCR, where they will complete bachelor’s degrees and research/design projects based in part on current research projects sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division.

0,Automated Video Activity Analysis for Military Operations,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Kenneth Sullivan,"The increasing use of video in force protection, autonomous vehicles reconnaissance, and surveillance in general has created a great demand for automated analysis and monitoring. It is infeasible to have humans monitoring and analyzing the vast amount of video used in such surveillance, and automated analysis yields hope to ease the burden and increase the amount of information extracted from collected video. Motivated by this and ongoing advances in the state-of-the-art in machine vision, we have been developing a basic system for automatically extracting useful information from video and making relevant data quickly available to a user. In particular we aimed to progress beyond typical scenarios presented in automated video analysis of a small set of pre-determined simple activities in high-resolution data. In completing the first phase we have answered many key questions and found many promising avenues to proceed in developing a complete system. From this, we have developed a second phase research plan building on and extending the work done. We plan to develop a complete operational prototype by focusing on yet more realistic data collections, increasingly complex activities, difficult tracking cases, and finally designing a fully integrated system.less","749,995",2010,2013

The developed models will be validated with experiments of participants: University of California Riverside Nano-Device Laboratory, Rochester Institute of Technology, and University of New Mexico. Novel models and simulation tools open a way to high-efficiency rad-hard solar cells and photodetectors. It is anticipated that QDS solar cells can achieve efficiencies of 60% via optimization of the light absorption (""multicolor"" cell), optical selection-rule relaxation, confinement-enhanced carrier transport (mini-band formation), and phonon dispersion. The proposed tools can be used for the QDS optimization for photovoltaic, photodetector, and laser applications.

0,Combinatorial Discovery of Metallic Systems with Superior Magnetic Transport Properties,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Richard Wilson,"In response to an ever-increasing technological demand for faster and more energy efficient ways to manipulate and control magnetism, this research project will discover methods for controlling magnetism with heat and light. Specifically, we will quantify the motion of magnetic moments of metal alloys in response to heat-currents and laser irradiation. This will allow for the identifications of atomic-composition/magnetic-transport-property relationships in magnetic metal systems. Understanding these relationships will allow us to design material systems with novel functionalities for electronically or optically writing information at ultrafast speeds and with ultralow powers. An innovative force that will help drive these discoveries is the development of a unique scientific tool-kit at UCR. We will combine high-throughput materials synthesis, characterization, and big-data computational analysis. This tool-kit will dramatically accelerate scientific discoveries in the domain of magnetic transport phenomena and therefore strengthen DoD research capabilities at UCR. A key component of this research project is its integration with research education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate student levels. The emphasis of the research educational efforts will be on the Hispanic communities of Southern CaliforniaÕs Inland Empire region. Our location in the Inland Empire provides us opportunities for STEM research education outreach to Hispanic communities. At the K-12 level, we will work with wellestablished programs to provide demonstrations and hands-on-learning opportunities at localscience fairs and campus-sponsored public events, e.g. Bourns Engineering day, STEMapalooza, and UCR/CTY outreach.

0,Nanocluster and their Mesoparticle Composites as Additives for Solid-Fuel Air-Breathing Propulsion,United States Department of the Navy,to Michael Zachariah,"Air-Breathing combustion either subsonic or supersonic has received renewed interest but is still challenged by some fundamental limitations. In the case of super-to-hypersonic combustion, oxidizer starvation is a major consideration. As a result, solid-fuel ram/scramjets are plagued with a very narrow operating envelope and unstable combustion properties. This arises due to poor flame holding characteristics, high ignition temperature, short residence times of particles, and mass transfer limitation of the oxidizer. Most efforts to mitigate these constraints focus on fluid dynamic effects.In this proposal we will consider alternative chemical approaches and fabrication methods to enable a new class of propellent which may offer wider operational windows and more efficient combustion. We will utilize nanomaterials as fuel constituents and develop assembly methods toallow bulk scale fabrication. We will test these new materials and develop optimized formulation and we will apply advanced diagnostics to interrogate these processes from a fundamental point of view so that eth knowledge bases gained will be of utility to further research by others.less","635,701",2020,2024
0,SPIN-DOUBLET EXCITON EXCHANGE IN HYBRID ORGANIC-QUANTUM DOT NANOSTRUCTURES,United States Air Force,to Ming Tang,"Light-matter interactions at the nanoscale involving strongly bound excited states form an intriguing yet practical route to controlling the energy in light. Here, the energy in photons is stored, exchanged and transferred in the form of spin-active excited states. This fundamental research will establish for the first time, the basis for the transfer of spin-doublet energy between semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and organic radicals. Once the physical parameters governing doublet energy transfer have been established, then these open-shell molecules will be able to augment the weak absorption of indirect gap silicon QDs in the near-infrared window I for photon upconversion. This ubiquitous and environmentally benign hybrid system has great potential for many applications in the life-sciences where blue or violet light is required in living tissue, for example, pain mitigation, oxygen detection, optogenetics and sensing. Here, important structure-property relationships will be obtained from well-defined CdSe QDs functionalized with specially designed open-shell molecules to have the appropriate wavefunction overlap and driving force for doublet energy transfer. Zinc blende and wurtzite CdSe QDs of different sizes will be investigated for the efficacy of spin-doublet photosensitization to surface bound organic radicals. Subsequent doublet-triplet energy transfer to emissive molecules by these organic radicals provides a simple yet accurate way to quantify the efficiency of this doublet photosensitization and energy transfer. Photon upconversion via the fusion of triplet excited states of diphenylanthracene or tetra(tert-butyl)perylene will report on the electronic communication within this hybrid nanostructure.less","600,000",2020,2023

This approach will enable us to develop conceptual models, data for quantitative models, and test out new concepts for better understanding and new insights. We will employ a new high-speed (Vis-IR) microscopy-thermometry capability as well as high speed mass spectrometry.

We will also be exploring a new concept using 'unzipping polymers' to generate more gas and minimize particle sintering as well as change the pre-heat zone. In Task 3 Another approach to manipulate the reaction front will use low temperature reactive gas generators, specifically metal hydrides to generate hydrogen to promote combustion and to propel particles away from each other to minimize sintering.

0,Context learning for security,United States Department of the Army,to Srikanth Krishnamurthy,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being increasingly used in several sensitive applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, malware classification, and network intrusion detection. However, the robustness of DNNs and their effectiveness have raised significant concerns; for example, there has been a surge in adversarial example attacks against them. Currently most DNNs do not account for a rich variety of information that is available in the input. For example, in images, they do not recognize if an object is out of place in a scene or in relation to other objects in that scene; similarly, inappropriate values in packet fields, or across a train of packets, are not accounted for by ML based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). In this project we propose to develop robust ML models that learn relationships across the components of an input (e.g., objects in an image, or header fields in a packet), which we refer to as context, and check for consistencies when making inferences relating to security. We believe, as supported by our preliminary experiments, that context can significantly harden ML models, and also improve their effectiveness in security applications. First, the project will make significant leaps beyond our initial endeavors to consider multiple visual sensors and multi-modal sensing (e.g., visual and LiDAR). Extracting context from multiple sources, is expected to significantly improve the fidelity of the inferences, and increase robustness to adversarial subversion. Second, a deep exploration into what types of context will be effective, and what can be easily defeated by attackers will be carried out, via developing an understanding of the attack surface projected by context-based defenses, and a principled approach to tune and evaluate different forms of context. Finally, the lessons learned in the visual and sensor spaces, will be carried over to the cyber-space, where the structure of the inputs, and the constraints imposed in terms of what types of context can be extracted, make the problem more challenging, but has promise in the development of secure ML based solutions to cyber-security. The project includes an extensive validation plan involving multiple datasets (including multi-sensor/modal sets, network intrusion detection and malware datasets) and emulations on an in house camera networks vehicles and a large scale software defined network testbed. The proposed work is expected to significantly enhance the army capabilities in terms of robust surveillance and security, especially given that future ISR and command and control applications will heavily deploy machine learning.

The FY 2016 DoD HBCU/MI Research and Education Program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicited proposals from single investigators at HBCUs and MIs s for the acquisition equipment and instrumentation in scientific areas important to one or more the three defense research offices, namely: Army Research Office (ARO); Office of Naval Research (ONR); and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). All equipment/instrument grant awards made under this program will have a 12-month performance period. Prof. Ming Tang at the University of California - Riverside submitted a request to ARO for the purchase of an absorption spectrophotometer and nuclear magnetic resonai1ce spectrometer to directly support research aimed at using plasmonic nanocrystals to increase the photon upconversion efficiency of hyb1id semiconductor nanoc1ystal in conjugated organic systems. The aim is to integrate research in photon upconversion with a robust program of nanomaterials-based educational activities involving middle and high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students from traditionally under-represented populations in STEM disciplines. The research goal is to investigate how plasmonic nanocrystals can enhance photon upconversion in a hybrid nanocrystal molecule platform. Photon upconversion can potentially enhance the conversion of solar energy to elect1icity, while making multi-photon imaging cheaper and more accessible. It would make solar energy competitive with electricity from fossil fuels, and bioimaging in the near-infrared (NI R) window routine. Compared to existing upconversion systems, nanocrystals have larger absorption cross-sections, and easily tunable optical properties out to the NIR This proposal seeks to exploit the plasmonic properties of noble metal and doped semiconductor nanoparticles to enhance photon upconversion. Fundamental light-matter interactions will be studied. Firstly, both plasmonic and doped semiconductor nanocrystals will be synthesized colloidally. The strong near-field ld enhancement characte1istic of metal nanoparticles could potentially enhance light absorption by the nanoparticle sensitizer, or emission by U1e molecular annihilator Alternatively, resonance between the LSPR and the absorption/emission maxima could perturb the oscillator strength and hence radiative/absorption rates. The si lver or gold nanoparticles will be colloidally synthesized and covalently attached to the nanocrystals and molecules comprising this hybrid upconversion system. Their effect on photon upconversion will be characterized by the equipment purchased through this grant and through various steady-state and time-resolved optical measurements.less","493,914",2016,2017

0,Electrogenetics: Controlling biological functions through electrically activated transcription,United States Air Force,to Ian Wheeldon,"The U.S. Air Force’s goal of creating new bioelectric devices for improving human capabilities, human-machine interfaces, and developing advanced hybrid biotic-abiotic systems depends on the ability to control the interface between biology and electronics. Many innovative technologies that add functionality to the biotic-abiotic interface have been created including in vivo metabolite sensing and electrical stimulation, the conversion of chemical binding and reaction events to electrical outputs, and the monitoring and activation of cell electrophysiology, among others. Missing from these technologies is the ability to directly interface electrical inputs with the central dogma of molecular biology: the transfer of gene-encoded information through transcription, translation, and protein function. This project seeks to address this critical technology gap by engineering electrically-activated transcription. By engineering redox- sensitive transcription factors, cell and cell-free technologies that activate genes of interest through low voltage inputs will be developed. Translation of the RNA products creates functional proteins, thus enabling the control of biological function from electrical inputs. The term electrogenetics is proposed to describe such technologies. A synthetic biology approach will be taken to harness and engineer the native ability of naturally redox-sensitive transcription factors (e.g., OxyR and SoxR from Escherichia coli) to create the first electrogenetic parts and develop electrode-based systems that can activate and repress transcription. The toolbox of electrogenetic parts will be expanded by analyzing transcriptional data from the metal-reducing bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, to discover the proteins and transcription factors that enable the bacterium to rapidly alter its transcriptome in response to changes in redox potential. The new field of electrogenetics will be demonstrated by creating cell-free systemsless","453,207",2017,2020

0,"A Rational Approach for Designing Lightweight, Energy-Efficient Components for Advanced Naval Materials",United States Department of the Navy,to Bryan Wong,"Research Problem: Soft electronic devices and flexible materials continue to attract significant attention for their use in next-generation technologies such as low-cost photodetectors in detection and surveillance applications. However, several challenges exist in improving material performance since these materials are complex, multiscale systems whose performance is determined by both structural and electronic quantum-mechanical effects. Consequently, the optimization of device performance requires a multi-scale first-principles approach for understanding these time-dependent electronic processes to improve material performance and promote widespread use in routine ONR defense applications. Technical Approach: This project will develop and implement the Soft Electronic Materials Studio (SEMS) – a comprehensive suite of computational methods and associated software tools to enable transformative advances in the rational design of lightweight, energy-efficient chargetransport materials. While conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) methods will be used to pre-screen initial soft materials in this effort, the main workhorse of this project is a new real-time, time-dependent density functional tight binding (RT-TDDFTB) computational approach developed in the PI’s laboratory to specifically predict and understand the optical, charge-transfer, and energy transfer mechanisms in conductive organic interfaces (typically thousands of atoms). The RT-TDDFTB techniques utilized in this project allow for detailed quantum simulations of very large material systems at the atomistic level that are beyond the reach of traditional DFT approaches. Anticipated Outcomes: The novel use of both RT-TDDFTB and massively-parallelized GPUs in this project provides the necessary means for addressing the large material sizes and the long time scales for the electron dynamics in the proposed detector materials. The specific outcomes are comprised of (1) a rational computational screening of both intermolecular and intramolecular donor-acceptor materials, (2) refining the propagation algorithms for long-time electron dynamics, and (3) error-mitigating benchmarks to verify the fidelity of these long-time simulations. Together, these combined tasks provide a systematic approach for improving material performance as well as demonstrate a new computational capability for calculating the excitedstate dynamics of these lightweight, technologically-important materials. Impact on ONR Capabilities: The capabilities and project objectives consist of (1) applications of the PI’s new algorithmic developments for probing and understanding chargetransport dynamics in various donor-acceptor electronic systems, and (2) implementation and utilization of novel GPU computing architectures to enable the dramatic acceleration of quantum dynamics studies of these lightweight, energy-efficient charge-transport materials. Most importantly, the detailed prediction of electronic dynamical properties in these systems will enable new materials for ultrafast electronics and tunable photodetection devices. As such, the capabilities developed in this project permit a deep understanding of non-equilibrium effects that will have broad applicability in image sensing, optical communications, chemical/biological sensing, and infrared surveillance, creating an exciting opportunity for ONR leadership in these novel functional materials.less","450,000",2018,2019
0,NEURAL COMPUTATIONS AND INFORMATION FLOW UNDERLYING UNCERTAINTY EVALUATION,United States Air Force,to Megan Peters,"When we see, hear, or otherwise experience the world, our perceptions are accompanied by a sense of confidence: Sometimes, we feel sure in what we see, whereas at other times we feel we are just guessing. Usually, the more confident we feel, the more likely we are to have made an accurate perceptual decision about the state of the world. Although recent research has focused on the neural computations that underlie this metacognitive ability to judge confidence, many open questions remain. To complicate this, sometimes metacognition can be “tricked” such that we feel very sure despite poor perceptual ability. In this project, we investigate a recently developed theory of this perceptual metacognition that depends on a biologically-plausible computational neural network framework and that we have shown can explain these errors in metacognition. First, we use computational functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, including multi-voxel pattern analysis (machine learning decoding), to reveal the computational model’s biological foundations and test the model’s predictions about metacognitive errors. Second, we use a cutting-edge application of machine learning applied to fMRI to induce participants to manipulate their own brain activity in a manner consistent with our computational modeling framework such that participants recalibrate metacognition to avoid metacognitive errors in the future. This project brings together theory, computational modeling, computational neuroimaging, and recent advances in applied machine learning to explore, test, and validate a new theory of perceptual metacognition. Results from our research will improve our basic science understanding of how metacognitive evaluations occur in the brain, suggest new strategies of how metacognition may be trained to better reflect the true state of the environment, and provide answers to why the metacognitive system evolved as it did.less","450,000",2020,2023
0,SILICON DIAMONDOID NANOCLUSTERS: PRECISION SYNTHESIS AND QUANTUM TRANSPORT PROPERTIES,United States Air Force,to TIMOTHY SU,"This proposal describes the chemical synthesis and electronic study of a new class of materials termed “silicon diamondoids” that are atomically precise nanoclusters of the silicon semiconductor. The miniaturization of silicon electronics has driven the major social and technological advances of our modern era. Current approaches for making silicon electronics relies on top-down approaches that start from a large silicon ingot that is shaved down to nanoscale dimensions using lithography. Electronics scaling and miniaturization is approaching a fundamental physical limit due to this top-down manufacturing approach. This proposal seeks to instead develop silicon electronics from the bottom-up, where molecular silanes are stitched together into silicon nanoelectronics using rational inorganic chemical synthesis. We will explore the synthesis and functionalization of silicon diamondoids while also interrogating their charge transport properties in single-molecule conductive junctions. Our first aim seeks to develop chemical methods to functionalize silicon diamondoids with diverse chemical groups that will tune their physical properties or enable their use in electronic devices. Our second aim explores how to make larger silicon diamondoids than what is currently known. Our third and final aim develops physical techniques for wiring single sila-diamondoid nanoclusters between gold electrodes to measure their quantum electronic transport properties. This will enable us to understand how electricity flows through crystalline silicon at its most basic unit-cell level, which is presently unknown despite being such a fundamental process in electronics and energy. Our synthetic approach may provide access to atomically precise Si nanocrystals where we can finely control Si nanocrystal properties by tailoring molecular structure, thus enabling wide-reaching advances in applications where Si nanocrystals are employed. The proposed work is synergistic with Air Force research interests and may lead to advancements in nanoelectronics, quantum information science, high-temperature carbon fibers for hypersonic applications, and doped SiC semiconductors for power electronics.less","450,000",2022,2025

0,VIPER 2D: Vertically Integrated Photocells based on Echeloned Responsivities in Two-Dimensional (2D) Heterostructures,United States Department of the Navy,to Nathaniel Gabor,"This proposal addresses an extraordinary paradox in biology, and along-standing problem in biophysical systems research: How do complex biosystems, such as the optic tectum in snakes, sense and process visual stimulus with incredibly low light levels, combining multiple inputs (both visible and infrared), and in remarkably short periods of time? To address this question - which lies at the interface of neuroscience, nanotechnology andbiological light-sensors - we will extend upon our hypothesis that light-sensing biosystems have evolved to take a general strategy: light from noisy sources is absorbed into a network in which the absorbing properties (number of channels, wavelength, etc.) have been tuned to reduce the noise into a stable form. Such light-sensing networks are capable of measuring the noise contrastin the spectral or spatial domain. This is of particular relevance to vision, since measuring contrast is the most efficient method of image reconstruction.The major aims of this proposal leverage the synergy of theoretical and experimental strengths already established in the Gabor Lab to explore challenging problems in fundamentally new ways. We aim to (I) examine fundamental noise properties of an artificial neural network model to understand how biosystems maintain high fidelity signals with extremely noisy lightinputs, (II) advance the fabrication and characterization of heterostructure optoelectronic devices composed of the ultrathin light-sensing materials graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) films, which mimic temperature sensing nerve cells in vipers, and (III) integrate VIPER2D into elementary bio-inspired networks.The research objectives are ambitious, combining insights from nanoscale optoelectronics to probe elementary mechanisms leading to efficient integration of visible and infrared stimulus.The key to revolutionary outcomes will be the synergy between quantitative modeling of biological neural networks and direct realization of emergent function in bio-inspired light sensing networks. No current field of research utilizes the synergistic approaches here, and theoutcomes of our experiments may challenge the paradigms of light sensing in biosystems. In alignment with the ONR~s strategy for gaining competitive advantage, this proposal - VIPER 2D - aims to establish a deep understanding of fast and highly sensitive neuro-inspired sensing and imaging, yet also promises rapid future advancement of DoD capabilities in multi-spectrum andmulti-domain imaging based on advanced component technologies.less","445,332",2019,2022
0,"DATA-DRIVEN CONTROL OF DYNAMICAL NETWORKS: FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS, ALGORITHMS, AND ROBUSTNESS GUARANTEES",United States Air Force,to Fabio Pasqualetti,"Networks are critically important in a variety of applications of interest to the DoD. Model-based techniques are traditionally used to operate these systems, requiring a detailed model of each component at all times. Importantly, accuracy and tractability of the models greatly affect the effectiveness of these methods, with the unfortunate trade-off that simple models are typically too inaccurate to be useful. In today’s data-rich world, the idea of leveraging collected data instead of, or in addition to, a cumbersome mathematical model is not only tantalizing, but also a necessity given the increasing complexity of modern distributed systems and networks. The potentials and pitfalls of model-free approaches have recently been demonstrated by the increasingly numerous applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence, for tasks ranging from autonomous driving, speech recognition, and navigation. In this project, the PI develop new theories and tools for data-driven control, secure operation, and adaptation of complex networks in contested, information-rich, and dynamic environments. While existing data-driven approches apply to non-structured systems, provide no optimality and robustness guarantees when data is maliciously corrupted or incomplete, and are task-specific, this project will undertake a rigorous approach based on control and network theories, optimization, and statistics to (i) formalize the applicability of data-driven methods for a variety of network control problems, (ii) reveal the fundamental robustness limitations of datadriven network control, and (iii) design data-driven algorithms to operate and optimize networks despite limited, corrupted, and outdated measurements.less","441,607",2020,2023

In this project we pursue these objectives by studying the human brain as a dynamical network system comprising neuronal ensambles and white-matter fibers, and governed by principles similar to social and technological cyber-physical networks. This innovative perspective allows us to leverage network and control-theoretic tools to develop mechanistic and mathematically-supported theories explaining the spatial and temporal behavior brain dynamics, and algorithms to predict and control them. In this project we focus on oscillatory neural dynamics, and develop network-based mechanisms to characterize time-varying amplitude and phase coherency among different brain regions, control the emergence of desired synchronization patterns, and characterize the fundamental principles of information transfer and control in brain networks. The research is organized around the following main tasks, namely, (i) Network principles of time-varying phase-amplitude synchronization, where we study the underlying mechanisms of phase-amplitude cluster synchronization in networks of oscillators, (ii) Network control of phase-amplitude synchronization patterns, where we develop targeted mechanisms to control the emergence of a desired phase-amplitude synchronization pattern, and (iii) Network motifs for optimal information transfer and control, where we investigate the properties of brain networks that enable selective transient amplification in response to particular signals and states, and develop theories to explain why such behavior can degenerate to sporadic or sustained bursting, as observed in diseased states such as epilepsy. This project will help the military forces develop solutions to enhance cognitive performance of warfighters and restore mental functions following traumatic brain injury and persistent stress. Additionally, the developed methods will impact networked scenarios where sensing and actuation is sparse and constrained, such as the deployment of (semi)autonomous systems in networked, uncertain, dynamically changing and hostile environments. Although this project will focus on human brain networks, we expect the developed methods to have broad applicability across the natural sciences and engineering, particularly in applications that are constrained by sparse and sporadic sensing and actuation.

0,Furthering STEM in the Inland Empire Through Thin Film Electronic Materials Research,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shane Cybart,"There is a critical need to develop a strong, diverse domestic work force in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to safeguard the security of our Nation. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage of U.S. citizen workers in STEM positions. The projected growth of the deficit is troubling, particularly for the defense industry which relies heavily on citizen workers. If current education and labor trends continue, the STEM worker shortage is predicted to reach 1 million citizen workers in just 6 years (2024). A recent study by the Rand National Defense Research Institute indicates that the increasing Hispanic demographic of the United States, coupled with very-low Hispanic participation in the STEM work force (~5%), has been exacerbating this issue. STEM educational outreach targeted specifically at Hispanic communities is critical to increase Hispanic participation rates in the STEM labor force. Here we propose to use this grant opportunity to bring new equipment to the University of California, Riverside that will allow us to strengthen existing Department of Defense (DoD) research, develop new DoD research capabilities and increase educational outreach at all levels: K-12, undergraduate and graduate, with emphasis on the Hispanic communities of Southern CaliforniaÕs Inland Empire region. Our location in the Inland Empire and close ties to the surrounding Hispanic communities and school districts in the Riverside and San Bernardino counties puts us is in a strong geographic position to accomplish our goals in STEM minority educational outreach. To accomplish our goals, we request funding for the acquisition of a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system for thin-film synthesis. The PLD system will be incorporated into a program that advances STEM education and research in the areas of thin film electronic materials, synthesis and characterization, as well as advanced nano-electronics engineering. Synthesis and characterization of functional materials overlaps with several relevant DoD related areas of interest, such as semiconductors, superconductors, metamaterials, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and photonics. Acquisition of a state-of-the-art PLD system will promote and support numerous ongoing DoD research projects, and it will provide UCR with the ability to launch new ones. At the K-12 level, we will work with existing well-established outreach programs to provide demonstrations and hands-on learning opportunities at local science fairs and campus-sponsored events. From an educational point-of-view, the synthesis of thin-films with a pulsed laser deposition system is a simple message to articulate; it is straightforward to develop programs that are conducive for all education levels and learning styles, e.g., visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. At the undergraduate level, students from the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) program will participate directly in DoD research programs and get hands-on training in preparation for graduate study. For graduate and post-doctoral education, this equipment will provide our campus with new cutting-edge technology for synthesizing novel thin-film materials. Training and experience with this type of technology is not currently available in the predominantly Hispanic region of California known as the Inland Empire. Therefore, the acquisition of this equipment will provide our students with special skills and experiences that are coveted by industry and will help them in their future careers.

0,Enabling Gigantic Antiferromagnetic Spin Caloritronic Effects through Spin Heat Accumulation,United States Department of the Army,to Richard Wilson,"Motivation and Hypothesis: The field of spin caloritronics strives to understand the coupling of spin and heat currents in magnetic heterostructures to discover novel mate1ial systems with functional thermal properties. To date, the field of spin caloritronics focused primarily on magnetic heterostructures with ferro- or ferri-magnetic order, such as Pt/yttrium-iron-garnet bilayers. In these types of systems, the magnitude of spin caloritronic phenomena at room temperature is small because the average energies, group velocities, and mean-free-paths of spin-waves in magnetic insulators are all small. We seek to discover extraordinary magneto -thermal transport phenomena by investigating a new class of spin-caloritronic material systems that possess antiferromagnetic order. Spin-waves in antiferromagnetic materials can possess energies and group-velocities orders of magnitude larger than ferro- and ferri-magnetic insulators. However, many antiferromagnetic insulators are not expected to display large spin-caloritronic effects in the absence of a strong magnetic field because spin-wave branches with opposite angular momentum are degenerate, or nearly degenerate. We hypothesize that spin-heat-accumulation in the normal metal will break the degeneracy by preferentially heating only one of the spin-wave branches, thereby enabling gigantic spin-caloritronic effects in antiferromagnetic heterostructures. To test our hypothesis, we will use our recent breakthroughs in controlling and characterizing electronic thermal transport in metal systems to design structures that can efficiently generate spin heat accumulation at interfaces. Objective: The overarching objective of our project is to gain a fundamental understanding of how spin-heat accumulation at a normal-metal/magnetic-insulator impacts spin caloritronic phenomena. To reach this objective, we propose two specific tasks. (1) We will use time-domain thermoreflectance measurements to provide the first quantitative measurements of the spin-dependent electron-phonon coupling coefficient in ferromagnetic metals. The asymmetry in electron-phonon coupling for up and down electrons plays a dominant role in determining the magnitude of spin-heat accumulation that can exist in metal heterostructures, but no experimental measurements of this asymmetry currently exist. (2) Using a combination of ultrafast pump/probe and thermo-electrical transport measurements, we will investigate how spin-heat accumulation at a normal-metal/antiferromagnetic interface impacts interfacial spin and heat currents. Expected Outcomes and ARO Relevance: An experimental discovery that directly links spin caloritronic phenomena and spin heat accumulation will profoundly affect our understanding of how heat and spins are coupled at interfaces. This discovery may enable a new class of functional spin caloritronic devices based on antiferromagnetic order, thereby enabling a novel field of study that focuses on antiferromagnetic spin caloritronic phenomena. Therefore, our work will significantly impact a wide array of scientific communities, including materials scientists, electrical engineers, thermal scientists, and condensed matter physicists. Furthern10re, our novel ultrafast characterization methods will provide direct insight into the potential utility of spin caloritronic phenomena for both next-generation computing technologies and terahertz radiation based imaging/sensing technologies.

We consider the scenario where full-duplex radio is used to provide the first line of defense at the physical layer of wireless network against eavesdropping from enemy. The full-duplex mode in any given full-duplex radio is treated as dynamically switchable (enabled or disabled) according to userÕs need. The residual self-interference in full-duplex radio is fully taken into account in maximization of secrecy capacity subject to rate, power and/or other constraints. We consider cases where social network and wireless network are treated holistically so that human needs are best served. One particular example is where military radio and civilian radio coexist to improve the efficiency in utilizing limited radio spectrum but without compromising security. The network and channel information readily available for communications among radios for common civilian purposes is utilized to provide additional security for communicating sensitive information. We will develop new insights into fundamental tradeoffs among network throughput, security, network and channel information, and computational complexity. Various network settings, from a three-node building block to networks of many nodes, will be explored. Broadband multicarrier systems as well as multiple-antenna radio will be considered. Fast computational algorithms for non-convex optimization problems arising from secure wireless network with full-duplex radio will be developed and thoroughly evaluated so that future FPGA implementation on programmable radio boards for real-time testing becomes feasible.less","329,784",2017,2020
0,Design and Operation of Secure Multi-Agent Networks,United States Department of the Army,to Fabio Pasqualetti,"Networks and distributed systems will play an increasingly fundamental role on the battlefield and in other operating theaters of interest to the U.S. Army, where success relies critically on integrity and availability of network resources. Despite redundancy in numbers, protected communication, and supervised operation, capable adversaries can disrupt networked operations by observing the behavior of a few units, spoofing exchanged messages, and tampering with coordination protocols. Crucially, it is the networked coordination among the units that introduces these vulnerabilities, which have neither been analyzed nor considered in the design and operation of network systems. This research stems from recent breakthroughs from the PI showing how security of networked multi-agent systems can be ensured at the design stage, by shaping interaction dynamics, and during operation, with reactive monitoring schemes. Blending these methods with classic cyber- and information-based techniques will dramatically increase reliability of networked systems in adversarial environments. To this end, we propose to address three fundamental research questions: What network features facilitate manipulability and increase robustness? We propose to identify structural and dynamic features that allow manipulability from benign controls and robustness against attacks and disturbances, and to characterize manipulability/robustness tradeoffs. How do we design networks with guaranteed manipulability and robustness? We propose to design algorithms to engineer networks that exhibit different desirable behaviors, at the node level, in response to localized stimuli from authorized controls and malicious disturbance. How do we ensure reliable network operation against coordinated adversaries? We propose to design network-centric methods to detect and identify nodes compromised by failure and coordinated attacks, and to reveal fundamental tradeoffs between network structure and security. This project will help the U.S. Army achieve reliable and efficient (semi)autonomous systems in networked, uncertain , dynamically changing, hostile environments. This project will undertake a rigorous approach based on control theory, graph optimization, and statistics to develop novel theories and tools to study and operate network systems. Results will be validated via simulations and experiments using aerial and ground vehicles in realistic environments similar to complex civilian and military platforms of interest to the U.S. Army. Because the results of this project will uncover foundational principles in the design and control of multi- agent networks, the results will have far-reaching implications across science and engineering, including for the social, medical and energy domains, as already demonstrated by the PI's preliminary work.less","323,000",2017,2020

0,Inferring ocean turbulence characteristics from Lagrangian measurements of sea ice acquired via remote sensing imagery,United States Department of the Navy,to Monica Wihelmus,"Sea ice drift is an important component of the Arctic climate system. In Marginal Ice Zones (MIZ), the dispersion of free-drifting sea ice is hypothesized to be driven by the underlying turbulent eddy field on spatial scales of the order of 10 km. This, in turn, has salient consequences regarding heat and fresh water budgets, and it suggests that the sea ice drift field can act as a proxy for ocean turbulence characteristics in high latitudes. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of sea ice drift fields is fundamental for the study of ocean turbulence in the Arctic. Although much progress has been made on this front through the acquisition of remote sensing observations, characterizing the sea ice drift field and its interactions with the underlying meso/submesoscale eddy turbulence has proven challenging given the range of spatiotemporal scales involved. To alleviate this issue and assure that the Navy can fulfill its mission globally, we propose to retrieve the kinematics of freedrifting sea ice, including daily velocities, rotation angles, and dispersion characteristics from optical remote sensing imagery using a powerful technique that we recently developed. We propose to leverage optical data (often overlooked due to atmospheric stamps and sunlight dependence) to study the evolution of sea ice drift in marginal ice zones (MIZ). To this end, we will process Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery unging from 8 to 65 km. As a result, we are able to retrieve sea ice kinematic products that we will use to infer the properties of the meso/submeso-scale (<20 km) eddy field at daily temporal scales. In particular, we will determine the dispersion characteristics of free-drifting sea ice and assess the role of atmospheric and oceanic forcing on ice floe motion. The dynamical regime of the sea ice drift field will be assessed via single- and two-particle dispersion analysis, as these metrics provide a description of the structure of the drift field. By examining the correlation of sea ice drift to external forcing sources, we will assess the influence of ocean turbulence on sea ice motion. Besides studying the topology of the sea ice drift field, we also propose to develop an automatic eddy detection algorithm from MODIS imagery. Our versatile approach to tracking sea ice also allows for the measurement of the rotation of free-drifting ice floes, which provides an additional resource to characterize the turbulent eddy field by quantifying eddy characteristics and their kinematics. With our technique, we will automatically retrieve the geographical location, length scale, and direction of identified eddies for the first time. Such an automatic detection tool can extend our understanding of the formation and dissipation mechanisms of meso/sub-mesoscale oceanic eddies in MIZ. Finally, we will explore sea icghout the years. MODIS provides an opportunity to analyze sea ice dynamics over the extent of the twenty-first century. We will thus characterize and explore the inter-annual variability of the sea ice drift and the turbulent eddy field of MIZ over the last two decades. ONR funding for this project will allow us to integrate a novel and extensive satellite observation database to analyze sea ice-turbulent ocean interactions. The robustness of our method will allow us to acquire long-term observations in key Arctic regions that will contribute to ONR-funded efforts (e.g., the MURI program) to achieving adequate parametrization and validation of sea ice in discrete models.

0,Laser Lithography to Advance STEM Education across the Inland Empire,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shane Cybart,"To safeguard the security of our Nation there is a critical need to develop a strong, diverse domestic work force in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage of U.S. citizen workers in STEM positions, and the projected growth of the deficit is troubling, particularly for the defense industry that relies heavily on citizen workers. If current education and labor trends continue, the STEM worker shortage is predicted to reach 1 million citizen workers in just 8 years (2024). A recent study by the Rand National Defense Research Institute indicates that the increasing Hispanic demographic of the United States, coupled with very-low Hispanic participation in the STEM work force (~5%), has been exacerbating this issue. STEM educational outreach targeted specifically at Hispanic communities is critically needed to increase Hispanic participation rates in the STEM labor force. Here we propose to use this grant opportunity to bring new equipment to the University of California, Riverside that will allow us to strengthen existing Department of Defense (DoD) research, develop new DoD research capabilities and increase educational outreach at all levels: K-12, undergraduate and graduate, with emphasis on the Hispanic communities of Southern CaliforniaÕs Inland Empire region. Our location in the Inland Empire and close ties to the surrounding Hispanic communities and school districts in Riverside and San Bernardino counties puts us is in a very strong position geographically to accomplish our goals in STEM minority educational outreach. To accomplish our goals, we request funding for the acquisition of a maskless laser lithography machine that will be incorporated into a program that targets advancing STEM education and research in the area of advanced micro-electronics engineering. Electronics processing overlaps with several relevant DoD related areas of interest, such as semiconductors, superconductors, metamaterials, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and photonics. At the K-12 level, we will work with existing well-established outreach programs to provide demonstrations and hands-on learning opportunities at local science fairs and campus-sponsored events. From an educational point-of-view, the construction process of circuits is a simple message to articulate; it is straightforward to develop programs that are conducive for all education levels and learning styles, e.g., visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. At the undergraduate level, students from the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) program will participate directly in DoD research programs and get hands-on training in preparation for graduate study. For graduate and post-doctoral education, this equipment will provide our campus with new cutting-edge lithography capabilities not currently available in Southern California and provide our students with unique coveted skills and experiences that will help them in their future careers. Furthermore, acquisition of this equipment and the new capabilities that it brings will promote and support many ongoing DoD research projects, and it will provide UCR with the ability to launch new ones.less","236,877",2017,2018

At the same time, Physicists use radicals for studies of fundamental nature, such as the search for Physics beyond the Standard Model, manybody effects in ultracold gases or precision measurements. The high reactivity of radicals makes them both interesting to study and challenging to handle at the same time. Isolating radicals with the goal of harnessing their unique properties is rendered very difficult since they tend to react quickly with their environment.

0,(DURIP) ESTABLISHING 3D PRINTED TRAPS FOR ELECTRON QUANTUM COMPUTING,United States Air Force,to BOERGE HEMMERLING,"The realization of a quantum computer is a much desired goal and driven by its potential applications ranging from designing new drugs, simulating new materials to addressing fundamental questions in physics, chemistry and biology which are otherwise intractable with classical computations. Harnessing the power of a quantum computer for these applications, however, requires the ability to control and connect many qubits, the quantum version of bits in a classical computer. This formidable task is aggravated by the fact that quantum information is extremely vulnerable to any coupling to the environment. To mitigate this challenge, quantum error correction codes can be used to protect the loss of quantum information. These codes, however, require additional auxiliary qubits and also have a minimum requirement on the quality of each individual operation. There are many very promising approaches to building a quantum computer. Trapped charged particles and superconducting electronic circuits are among the record-breaking approaches. Both platforms have shown extraordinary successes in controlling quantum information and implement- ing quantum algorithms. However, they have yet to be scaled to sizes where useful quantum calculations can be performed to realize aforementioned applications. A novel approach that breaks with this paradigm is using trapped electrons for quantum information processing. Such a platform would combine the high-performance of trapped charged particles with the modularity and speed of superconducting qubits. Moreover, recent advances in microfabrication using 3D printing technology allow for building structures which can confine and interconnect electrons and are potentially scalable to control millions of qubits in the future. The proposed instrumentation will provide a setup to develop and test 3D printed Paul traps with the goal to confine single electrons and perform basic quantum operations on them. In particular, this includes a cryogenic vacuum chamber with a socket to readily exchange traps to drive and inform their development.

0,Picosecond Streak Camera for Measuring Dynamics in Photomechanical Materials,United States Department of the Navy,to Christopher Bardeen,"Publicly Releasable Project SummaryAgency Program Officer: Peter MorrisonDirectorate: Basic and Applied Sci, Picosecond Streak Camera for Measuring Dynamics in Photomechanical MaterialsPhotons are massless, chargeless particles that can be,beamed across space or directed through optical fibers. They are immune to electromagnetic interference, while possessing control p,arameters (wavelength, polarization) that allow them to be easily manipulated and multiplexed. It is an open question as to whether, photons could supplant chemical fuels and electrons as energy transporters, at least for applications where weight or electromagnet,ic interference are key concerns. To accomplish this, analogs to the internal combustion engine or electric motor must be developed, that can directly convert photons into mechanical work. The PI is a member of a MURI project (Advanced Optical Materials That Cre,ate Force from Light, ONR N00014-18-1-2624) whose goal is to create photomechanical materials that can accomplish the light-to-work, conversion. The general approach is to organize photoreactive molecules in polymers and crystals so that their photoinduced shape,changes can act in concert to generate a macroscopic output. A central goal of the MURI is to gain a quantitative understanding of,how molecular events on picosecond timescales ultimately give rise to largescale photomechanical motion on nanosecond to millisecond, timescales. In order to monitor the material as it evolves chemically and deforms physically, one would like to take snapshots of,both its chemical state and its mechanical actuation.This proposal requests funds to purchase a streak camera that can take such sn,apshots across a range of timescales, from picoseconds to milliseconds. It can be configured for both time-resolved spectral detec,tion and time-resolved position detection, making it the ideal instrument to probe dynamics from molecular to macroscopic lengthscal,es. In its standard configuration, the streak camera can perform time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on stationary samples,, providing information about excited state relaxation rates. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of this instr,ument and develop new experiments that can address specific questions in photomechanical materials. The three new experiments that,will be based on the streak camera are:1) In conjunction with a pulsed lamp, it will serve as a detector for long-time transient ab,sorption experiments. Combined with a femtosecond set-up, it will allow us to characterize multi-step isomerization reactions over,10 orders of magnitude in time (10-14 s to 10-3 s). 2) It will serve as a high-sensitivity photoluminescence lifetime instrument t,o perform intermittent measurements, allowing us to track changes in material properties and reaction rates during the conversion of, photomechanical crystals and polymers.3) It can be configured to measure the spatial displacements of reacting photomechanical obj,ects with sub-micron resolution across 8 orders of magnitude in time (10-11 s to 10-3 s). We emphasize that all these experiments c,an be performed using the same streak camera detection system. All that is required is to interface it with instrumentation (laser,sources, optical components) already available in the PIs lab. The streak camera will allow us to make concrete connections between, molecular-level chemical reactions and macro-scale mechanical motions.

The internal quantum efficiency of light-emitting diodes and laser diodes, defined as the fraction of the electron-hole pairs that recombine by emitting a photon, is reduced by various non-radiative recombination processes. Non-radiative recombination, which involves lattice defects and impurity atoms, is detrimental for many electro-optic devices used for sensing and imaging. Non-radiative recombination involves phonons, i.e. quanta of crystal lattice vibrations, for energy dissipation. Phonons with specific momentum and energy are needed to satisfy the conservation laws for the electron-hole recombination process to occur. In this project, we investigate a possibility of suppressing the phonon assisted recombination processes by engineering the phonon and electron density of states in specially designed crystal structures. Modification of the acoustic phonon dispersion in periodic arrays of nanostructures, e.g. quantum dots, can result in the emergence of gaps or peaks in the density of states in relevant wavelength intervals, thus affecting recombination rates in the processes requiring phonons for momentum conservation. The properties of specially designed nanostructures are investigated using a combination of experimental techniques: Brillouin-Mandelstam and micro-Raman light scattering spectroscopies, low-frequency electronic noise spectroscopy, photoluminescence and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopies. The charge carrier trapping-emission dynamics is studied using the low-frequency electronic noise measurements. The project outcomes include fabricated sets of periodic semiconductor crystal structures; measured low-frequency noise characteristics of the periodic arrays and reference samples; phonon spectra of quantum dot arrays; and charge-carrier recombination rates. The results of this proof-of-concept project have practical implications for the design of novel photodetectors, sensors, and light-emitting diodes.less","150,000",2017,2019

0,Algorithms for Image Content Indexing and Information Retrieval from Unstructured or Semi-structured Complex Database,United States Department of the Army,to Agenor Mafra-Neto,"Humans take for granted their extraordinary visual abilities, however efforts to give such abilities to computers have meet with limited success thus far. Objects may be difficult for a computer to recognize/index because they are partly occluded, viewed from an unusual angle, because they blend into the background due to low contrast (or camouflage), or more generally because the best features (color, shape or texture) to recognize the objects may vary from image to image. The problems are further compounded by the typical need for fast response time. While computer CPU speeds allow for very fast processing, most image-databases reside on hard-drives. Query of disk-resident image data using linear search results in far too slow retrievals to be of practical use in most military settings. If successful, this STTR will provide both accuracy and speed in a simple, intuitive and maintainable/upgradeable system designed for efficient and timely searches of massive image archives. We will achieve speedup by leveraging of recent advances in indexing enormous datasets, and will investigate principled ways to solve the ""multitude of features"" problem (i.e shape, color, texture) by using relevance feedback to autonomously and interactively learn optimal weightings of the features on a query by query bias.less","100,000",2007,2008

0,Automated Video Activity Analysis for Military Operations,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Kenneth Sullivan,"The increasing use of video in force protection, autonomous vehicles reconnaissance, and surveillance in general has created a great demand for automated analysis and monitoring. It is infeasible to have humans monitoring and analyzing the vast amount of video used in such surveillance, and automated analysis yields hope to ease the burden and increase the amount of information extracted from collected video. Recent research on automated analysis has focused on detection of a set of simple activities in a given context. However further development is needed to generalize this analysis to be truly useful in effectively using collected video. For example, it is not generally possible to know ahead of time what an image analyst will be looking for. Additionally in many cases human attention is required for decision making, but this attention needs to be focused on a very limited set of collected video. We propose to develop a system for extracting useful information from large-scale video collections.
