0,(MURI 18) Gallium Oxide Materials Science and Engineering GAME,United States Air Force,to James Speck,"?-Ga2O3 is the largest bandgap (~4.5 eV) semiconductor that can be grown directly from themelt in single crystal form. The ease of n-type doping with tetravalent cations, and a widevariety of bulk single crystal and epitaxial film growth techniques have triggered worldwideinterest in ?-Ga2O3. The predicted breakdown electric field (6-8 MV/cm) is higher than that ofGaN or SiC (~3 MV/cm), which when combined with electron mobility (predicted 250-350cm2/Vs) yields amongst the best figures of merit for power electronic devices. As a result, ?-Ga2O3 possesses transformative potential for not only power electron devices but also highfrequency devices, and deep UV optoelectronics.less","7,500,000",2018,2021
0,"Neural Foundations of Expertise Based on Optimal Decision-making, Physical Control and Responses to Stress",United States Department of the Army,to Scott Grafton,"The objective of this proposal is to characterize expertise in terms of the changes within and between the neural systems that support decision-making and the closely related process of habit formation (effective action selection), the physical control of skilled action (reliable execution) and the adaptive control of stress responses (resilience). Tasking to acheive the stated objective of this proposal will include a suite of experimental tools applied to humans and non-human primate (NHP) subjects and computational approaches applied to the resulting multimodal datasets. Proposers hypothesize that integration across the decision-making, physical control of skilled action and adaptive control of stress neural systems can be observed as a function of training at the anatomic, neural, behavioral and computational levels of analysis. Proposers plan to combine commonly used neural and physiological sensing modalities (e.g., single unit and LFP electrophysiology, fMRI, heart rate, skin conductance, and pupillometry), and recently developed methods (fast scan cyclic voltammetry for dopamine neurotransmitter sensing and neurotropic viral methodologies) while subjects participate in a longitudinal approach-avoidance decision-making learning paradigm. The longitudinal behavioral study will be combined with neurochemical detection of the neurotransmitter dopamine, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cortical mapping of stress responses in decision-making neural networks in non-human primates and humans. This approach enables a systematic study of various neural contributors to the process of skill learning entailing theoretically well-grounded and hypothesis-driven experiments to assess the contribution of these various factors to learning. The proposed approach also includes a strong data analysis and modeling effort to help guide the design and interpretation of the experiments. The proposal also emphasizes the implementation of network control theory and less traditional methods from ""pure"" mathematics, such as algebraic topology, to identify neural networks controlling brain network dynamics and neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for skill learning.less","6,250,000",2016,2021
0,Abelian Bridge to Non-Abelian Anyons in Ultra-Cold Atoms and Graphene,United States Department of the Army,to Andrea Young,"This proposal aims to demonstrate and comprehensively explore nonabelian anyons via an interdependent investigation of solid-state materials and ultracold atoms. Success would constitute a landmark basic-science achievement and mark a critical step towards new quantum technologies, as nonabelian anyons form the basis of fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Nonabelian excitations arise in two distinct contexts. First, they can appear ÔintrinsicallyÕ as quasiparticles in strongly correlated topological phases of matter, notably fractional quantum Hall states and quantum spin liquids. Second, nonabelian statistics can appear ÔextrinsicallyÕ from defects engineered in comparatively simple 2D abelian topological phases. In either case, a successful approach must feature widely tunable microscopic interactions, enabling global control over the phase diagram and local control over quasiparticles and defects. Recent advances pioneered by our team in the control of ultra-cold atoms and van der Waals heterostructures provide a timely opportunity to engineer both abelian and nonabelian anyons in conceptually novel and experimentally accessible configurations. Our proposed efforts utilize the shared virtues of cold atoms and van der Waals heterostructuresÑwidely tunable interactions and physical geometriesÑwhile leveraging the special advantages of each platform, namely grapheneÕs unique electronic structure and the ability to tune microscopic cold-atom Hamiltonians with time-dependent potentials. We will develop three experimental avenues to nonabelian physics, focusing on the most promising cold-atom and solid-state candidates: realizing intrinsic nonabelian ground states, engineering synthetic nonabelian defects via Cooper pairing, and creating related defects by purely geometric means. Our general approach is to develop ground states proximal to nonabelian states, and then induce nonabelian behavior using tunable coupling between systems, introduction of defects, or periodic modulation. An important feature of the proposed work is the mutually complementary nature of our solidstate and cold-atom approaches. As an example, cold atoms straightforwardly realize disorder-free systems but often suffer from relatively high temperatures, while solid-state systems can be easily cooled but preclude total control over sample disorder. Even as we advance both fields through innovations in atomic cooling and fabrication of ultra-clean heterostructures, our joint effort will provide ample opportunity for reciprocal quantum emulation: atomic systems can simulate anyonic signatures in disordered solid-state systems using tunable disorder, while finite-temperature effects can be controllably simulated in solid-state systems. In many cases, our proposed platforms admit new probes that have never been applied to anyonic systems, including spatially resolved transport, thermodynamics, and spectroscopic measurementsÑfacilitating an unprecedented characterization of nonabelian anyons not possible in either setting by itself.

The overarching contribution of this research is to build quantifiable infonnative models of team behavior as dynamical systems interacting over multiple networks, develop rigorous models that relate interaction patterns and network evolution to task performance, break new ground in the learning of optimal design of teams, scaling teams to complex tasks, and advancing social science theories of team performance. This research will produce methods to optimize team performance under different contexts and resource constraints. The research team will identify bottom-up approaches for improving team performance. They will identify meso-level approaches to get teams to adapt and increase their robustness. And finally, they will develop 'top-down' strategies for effectively assigning individuals to teams, and teams to tasks. The proposed effort brings together seven academics from five universities and pulls together an excellent balance of multidisciplinary scholars from sociology, cognitive and social psychology, health and behavioral sciences, computer science, statistics, controls and dynamical systems, and network science. Thrust 1 (teams as networks of interacting entities) will model teams as semantically-labeled multilevel networks with attributes on nodes, edges, and subgroups and these conceptual models will be experimentally validated; develop statistical models of team performance as information flows; and examine the relationship between influence networks, collective intelligence, task perfonnance, and robustness and optimization. Thrust 2 (analysis and models of dynamic team behavior) will examine the perfonnance of teams on a sequence of tasks. They will examine changes in social influence networks resulting from repeated tasks and examine team adaptability using methods from computational learning and data-driven optimization. Thrust 3 (network science of teams-of-teams) will examine the scalability of teams and tasks.

0,"Multi-Principal Element Alloys: Exploration, Design and Understanding (MPE.EDU)",United States Department of the Navy,to Tresa Pollock,"Metallic materials are foundational components in a vast array of navalsystems, including ships, submarines, sea-based aircraft and hypersonic vehicles. While some metallic alloy systems are perceived as mature, new computational methodologies, emerging informatics tools and new high throughput experimental innovations are greatly expanding the scope for discovery and implementation of new alloys for future generations of advanced engineering components. Most recently, multi-principal element (MPE) alloys have emerged as a promising new class of advanced metallic materials. With five or more elements present in nondilute quantities, exceptional properties (strength, toughness, magnetization, fatigue endurance) have been observed, though mostly in small quantities of material that are far from optimized compositionally or structurally. A lack of fundamental understanding of the mechanistic origins of exceptional MPE properties, thought originally to be due to high configurational entropy, remains as a major barrier. Critical gaps in the computational and experimental infrastructure for exploration of the extraordinary large compositional design space also strongly inhibit progress.The overarching goal of this proposed effort is to revolutionize our ability todesign, explore and fundamentally understand the processing, properties andenvironmental behavior of refractory body centered cubic (bcc) MPE alloys.Compared to face centered cubic (fcc) MPE systems based on Ni, Fe and Co, farfewer investigations exist on refractory MPE alloys comprised of mixtures of higher temperature metallics, such as Ta, W, Nb, Mo, Hf. While refractory MPEs promise high strength, in combination with high melting temperature, the tendency for brittle fracture at low temperature, the difficult processing paths, and the breadth of the unexplored compositional space, make discovery of new compositions via a purely experimental approach completely prohibitive. To succeed in this endeavor, we have brought together an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team, called MPE.EDU. The proposed MPE.EDU team has a long track record of successful collaboration and deep expertise in metallic materials and integrated computational materials engineering from UCSB, UCSD and UVa, supported by collaborations with GE, ATI Specialty Alloys and Citrine Informatics. Together, MPE.EDU will launch new computational, high throughput experimental and informatics approaches, and integrate these tools to 1) explore the vast refractory MPE compositional space and 2) build the needed fundamental understanding of the properties of this new class of materials.The MPE.EDU team specifically aims to: (1) develop and deploy acomputational infrastructure complemented with combinatorial approaches forexploration of the MPE refractory alloy space; (2) simultaneously build open-source databases for refractory MPEs; (3) employ unique processing approaches for MPE synthesis; (4) integrate emerging computational and experimental approaches to understand the unique aspects of dislocation motion, diffusion and mechanical behavior in MPEs and; (5) address fundamental issues underpinning the strong influence of interstitial elements on mechanical behavior and their interplay with oxidation. With extensive experience in alloy design and integrated computational material science and engineering, MPE.EDU will remove empiricism from the design process and lay the foundation for rapid MPE alloy discovery and development.less","5,400,000",2018,2022
0,N-polar devices for ultra-high power and linearity at millimeter-wave,United States Department of the Navy,to Umesh Mishra,"N-polar Nitrogen-polar Gallium Nitride deep recess high electron mobility transistors have demonstrated record high power density with high efficiency in the W-band frequency range – over double the power density reported from other technologies. This achievement is thanks to simultaneous achievement of three factors: high breakdown voltage with dispersion well-controlled, high large signal current swing, and high gain. Nitrogen-polar devices have also demonstrated impressive linearity at 10 GHz as determined from the OIP3 to DC power ratio. These achievements will be leveraged as a starting point to significantly improve the power density, efficiency, and linearity at 30 GHz. The improvements will stem from a combination of increased device voltage swing and current swing at 30 GHz large signal conditions, as well as a method to increase the intrinsic linearity of the device. Those improvements will be based on improved epitaxy and new device processes and layout. Power cells with high absolute power will also be demonstrated. The metrics will be characterized by single-tone and two-tone load pull at the wafer level. These devices today seem to have good OIP3 to DC power ratio due to the device configuration. Further improvements to this linearity metric with simultaneous low noise figure will be achieved by a combination of reduction of the intrinsic nonlinearity, plus a novel incorporation of nonlinearity cancellation methods. These methods will be guided by experimental data and nonlinear device models, and realized by improvements to epitaxy in combination with appropriate device layout and processes. The device linearity will be characterized by two-tone load pull at the wafer level. Noise will be characterized by swept frequency noise parameters measured at the wafer level. The improvements to the device which are anticipated under this program will be beneficial for a wide range of transmitter and receiver applications.devices for ultra-high power and linearity at millimeter-waveless","3,617,720",2017,2023

These new capabilities will enable highly architectured structural components, which in the future, may be printed layer-by-layer or voxel by voxel, on demand. This proposed research program aims to dramatically expand our ability to discover and synthesize high temperature intermetallic-containing structural materials that are amenable to additive manufacturing approaches. To explore the materials design space, which is extraordinarily large and relatively sparsely explored, theory-guided density functional theory tools will be combined with a unique suite of 3D processing and characterization platforms. A novel TriBeam tomography platform will be deployed for acquisition of 3D high resolution, multimodal (chemical, crystallographic and structural) data on materials at the melt pool scale, to obtain new insights on solidification, defect formation and the thermodynamic stability of intermetallic phases and to guide alloy design. An open-source laser-based experimental platform capable of operating in either layer-by-layer additive mode or combinatorial chemical mode will be developed for exploration for new materials systems. The materials focus of the program will be on (a) discovery and synthesis of multicomponent Co-base alloys strengthened by L12 intermetallics and (b) theory-guided exploration of the ternary and higher order Nb systems likely to contain cubic B2, Heusler or Half-Heusler intermetallics.

0,Engineered Heusler Compound Heterostructures and Superlattices,United States Department of the Navy,to Christopher Palmstrom,"Heusler compounds are a large group of intermetallic compounds with ~1500 memberswith similar crystal structures having a vast array of tunable properties. This offers the possibilityof engineering novel materials and heterostructures possessing properties far beyond what bandgap engineering has done for III-V semiconductor technology. These properties depend on thenumber of valence electrons per formula unit allowing tuning of properties through compositionand alloying. Tuning of Heusler compound properties include semiconducting band gap,metallicity, magnetism, half-metallicity, superconductivity, shape memory, and, potentially,piezoelectricity. Combining Heusler compounds with different properties into heterostructuresand superlattices allows for fundamental studies as well as engineered applications ofmagnetoresistance and superconducting proximity effects coupled with shape memory andpiezoelectricity. Despite the wealth of tunable properties and potential for tailored dissimilarproperties heterostructures, studies of heterostructures and superlattices have not beenperformed. In this proposed study, molecular beam epitaxy and chemical beam epitaxy will beused to grow and tailor Heusler heterostructures and superlatttices combining magnetic, halfmetallic, superconducting, shape memory, topological and semiconducting Heusler compoundsto develop a fundamental scientific understanding of coupling and engineering of theirproperties. Control of composition, structure and defects is essential to gain knowledge ofintrinsic properties and their tailoring. In-situ and ex-situ atomic level structural, electronic andmagnetic characterization techniques including superconducting tunneling spectroscopy will beused to study and provide feedback control of surface, interface and bulk properties. The use ofchemical beam epitaxy is to develop a growth process that will enable a self-limiting growthcondition to improve stoichiometry control.

0,SciTrek Biotech,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Norbert Reich,"For the average high-schooler, education is synonymous with memorization and regurgitation of curriculum, whose concepts often have unclear links to real-world scenarios and that seldom, if ever, require an original contribution. SciTrekBiotech is about breaking this mold. SciTrekBiotech engages teams of K-12 students in structured but self-driven explorations of bio-science/technology questions, using multi-tiered mentoring involving peers, K-12 teachers, university students and faculty. Importantly, SciTrekBiotech ’s model of engagement allows the program to simultaneously impact distinct points of the STEM pipeline: from K-12 students, to teachers and teachers in training, to university students. This uncommon feature in the landscape of education programs, which typically have a single stakeholder, coupled with the PI’s past record of success and the program access to world-class STEM and Biotechnology research programs, facilities and personnel, aligns SciTrekBiotech with multiple goals of the Federal and DoD STEM strategy and represents a unique addition to DoD’s portfolio, with the potential to create a national model for K-12 education and teacher training. Briefly, in SciTrekBiotech, teams of 4-6 K-12 students investigate a scientific question prompted by an experimental observation presented to them by university students, trained in the SciTrekBiotech method. This is the start of a journey of discovery that sets the SciTrekBiotech experience apart from other K-12 programs: K-12 student teams are not passive spectators, but are given full ownership of the project. They formulate “testable questions,” and decide on an experimental plan, which is then implemented over several days. Teams are also asked to present posters, discuss their findings, and provide an argument for their conclusions. Each class engages in two distinct “modules” each year; assessments occur before and after the modules. For some modules, these investigations culminate in a classroom-wide optimization project involving competition between classes. The implementation of SciTrekBiotech’s pedagogic model is made possible by extensive use of STEM undergraduate students (volunteers and core team). Volunteers are trained to lead authentic science inquiry: an uncommon experience in an educational path still mostly based on memorization. Core team members (Team SciTrekBiotech) carry out science education research, present their research at local and national science meetings, and help design modules and train volunteers. We propose a new course, open to all undergraduates, to foster appreciation of the scientific process, critical thinking skills, and students’ attitudes towards science. A new seminar series, featuring industry and DoD speakers, will explore career paths in biotechnology. SciTrekBiotech has a built in sustainability plan through teachers’ professional development: elementary and secondary teachers are empowered to independently lead their classrooms in the SciTrekBiotech modules, using workbooks and experimental materials provided by the program free of charge (secondary teachers are also supported by university students). In addition, SciTrekBiotech will develop a Master program (now a pilot) that will teach credential students (School of Education) how to incorporate this innovative program into their classroom. SciTrekBiotech leverages the successful track record of our outreach program SciTrek, which reaches 1,500-2,000 K-12 students each year (40-60% URMs): we propose to triple the number of K-12 student participants over the duration of the grant. In addition, we propose to expand the program beyond UCSB, through partnerships with other colleges and universities, towards creating a national model of K-12 education and teacher training.less","2,990,288",2021,2024
0,Controlling recombination in wide-bandgap materials,United States Department of the Navy,to Christian Van de Walle,"It has recently become clear that our current understanding of recombination processes at localized defects or impurities in solids,is incomplete. Such recombination events govern loss mechanisms and reliability of devices and the quantum efficiency of light emit,ters, including single-photon sources for quantum information science. Work by the PI has revealed that excited states play a decis,ive role in nonradiative recombination, and hitherto neglected ?impurity Auger? processes have a large impact. The proposed project,is aimed at rigorously calculating the rate of these processes; using the acquired knowledge to significantly improve device perform,ance; and validating the approach through experimental collaborations. Correct inclusion of these mechanisms is particularly import,ant in wide-bandgap materials, where current recombination models greatly underestimate the rates. Building on the PI?s expertise, f,irst-principles approaches for accurately calculating transition rates involving excited states and Auger processes will be develope,d. A fundamental understanding of these mechanisms is essential to suppress nonradiative recombination in wide-bandgap light emitte,rs and power electronics.

0,THIS GRANT IS A CONTINUATION OF N000141210976 - EXtreme Electron Concentration Oxide DEvices (EXEDE),United States Department of the Navy,to Susanne Stemmer,"The development of epitaxial oxide structures that combine unprecedented high electron densities and high dielectric strengths has the potential to create a new class of extreme powerdensity electronics for communications and energy applications. Modulation of the high carrier density in these structures will lead to next-generation plasmonics by enabling reconfigurable antennas, and plasmonic modulators. The objective of the multidisciplinary program ÒEXtreme Electron concentration oxide DEvices (EXEDE)Ó is to enable this paradigm shift in electronic and plasmonic devices by (i) the control of extreme-density, two-dimensional electron gases at polar oxide interfaces, (ii) engineering the band separation at oxide interfaces and (iii) innovative approaches to increase electron mobility and carrier velocities. To achieve these objectives, EXEDE establishes a highly interconnected multidisciplinary effort that includes sophisticated materials growth approaches, theoretical and experimental investigations of transport and optical physics and advanced device engineering. The devices and applications at the center of the project include extreme charge density field-effect transistors, charge gain devices, nanoribbon field effect transistors, plasmonic antennas and modulators. Transistor development will focus on high frequency electronic devices for communication applications and ultracompact high voltage energy efficient power switching devices. The device research program is underpinned by advancing oxide materials physics to address challenges such as their low mobility due to high phonon scattering rates. First-principles calculations and transport theory will improve understanding of transport, and will closely collaborate with experimental investigations of electron velocity and high-field transport, relevant for high-speed devices. Innovative approaches to enable efficient transport include phonon engineering and reduced dimensionality to enhance transport, band engineering to reduce effective mass, and hybrid oxide/Si structures to transfer the electrons to high mobility materials. A strong materials effort will be focused on unprecedented quality of extreme-electron concentration heterostructures, including on high mobility substrates, band offset engineering, and on exploring new oxide material systems with higher intrinsic mobility. Another significant outcome will be a knowledge base of device fabrication techniques for oxides, including contacts, etching, surface passivation, and gate dielectrics, and a clear understanding of the critical device physics. The program will significantly impact DoD capabilities not only through the demonstration of superior and new electronic and plasmonics devices that could enhance communication, signal processing, and energy conversion applications, based on a new class of electronic materials, but also by catalyzing further research in this field.less","2,505,000",2016,2016
0,Defending Cyber-Physical Systems using Federated Learning of Physical Models,United States Department of the Navy,to Giovanni Vigna,"Project Abstract Cyber-physical systems (CPS), or systems that interact with the physical world through sensory input and cyber-control systems, are becoming increasing ubiquitous. Such systems are often deployed in safety-critical scenarios, e.g., managing power generation and delivery, controlling manufacturing processes, or coordinating automotive systems. As opposed to traditional cyber-systems, physical faults can easily lead to human harm, sometimes on a large scale. Therefore, the reliability, integrity, and availability of physical processes and their control are of paramount concern. We propose to defend cyber-physical systems through two complementary research thrusts: Inferring physical models for cyber-physical systems and federated learning. The goal of the model inference thrust is to identify behavioral models of cyber-physical systems that characterize the system's physical aspects. However, instead of deriving the physical model from engineering blueprints or expert knowledge, we propose to treat the physical process as a black box. We then learn models from observations of the CPS that are augmented with physical constraints that apply for the process under analysis (e.g., maximum values for velocity, acceleration, or other physical dimensions). Messages can then be identified as malicious if they would drive the inferred model into a state that violates the underlying physical constraints. Learning physical models will provide operators with real-time feedback of anomalous and potentially malicious control commands and sensory inputs to cyber-physical systems. However, machine learning in adversarial contexts -- that is, one in which attackers can supply inputs to the protected system that are evaluated by the model, and where an attacker might have knowledge of the model parameters -- has important limitations such as scarcity of training data and concept drift. We propose to address these concerns using federated learning. The intuition behind federated learning is that global information can compensate for local deficiencies. In particular, federated learning involves the use of inputs, behaviors, and models gathered from outside the local system. We propose several instantiations of this idea to provide (i) distributed identification of ""black sheep,"" or systems that behave differently from a community of similar systems (a ""flock""); flock behavior as a mechanism for suppressing local false positives; and, compensation for local training data scarcity. Protecting existing and next-generation cyber-physical systems will require significant research that is informed by real-world issues such as limited resources and real-time constraints. Our proposed approach integrates high-fidelity physical models for local cyber-physical systems with federated learning that exploits global information for improved detection capability and minimal false positives. This novel approach will fill a crucial gap in our ability to defend the cyber-physical systems that power our infrastructure and our society.less","2,233,928",2016,2017

0,Multifunctional Metamaterial Laser Energy Control,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Jonathan Suen,"Oxford Defense North Carolina, LLC (ODNC) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will collaborate to develop a beam control metamaterial surface in this Phase II STTR effort. A concern with laser beamed energy systems is the inadvertent exposure of operators and bystanders to inadvertently scattered or reflected laser energy. In an Energy Web, multiple transmitters and receivers will be mounted on mobile land and airborne platforms, thus unexpected vehicle dynamics may cause beam misalignment and exposure of personnel from energy by reflection from adjacent structures or glint. A solution may be to cover adjacent structures with an absorptive or scattering coating, i.e., black and white paint. However, this would present a large static visual signature, and could not protect canopies or windows. Instead, we are developing a conformal beam control metamaterial. Metamaterials are engineered sub-wavelength periodic structures with tailored electromagnetic properties. The metamaterial will scatter or absorb (as designed) laser energy in a narrow band while presenting a minimal visual and infrared signature at other wavelengths. Using metamaterial theory and techniques developed in academic research, the metamaterial will be able to sustain high laser intensities without damage, and will be able to be economically fabricated over large areas. The system is completely passive with zero reaction time, yielding a significant size, weight, power, and cost benefit over active sensing. In the Phase I effort, small metamaterial test coupons were designed, fabricated, and characterized.

0,Cognitive Models and Strategies for High-Performance Human-AI Teams,United States Department of the Army,to Francesco Bullo,"Mixed human-AI teams will pervade future Army and DoD operations and their relevance to the ultimate Army mission cannot be understated. There is however a limitation in available data, models and theories that explain the dynamic behavior, coordination, and performance of human-AI teams. For example, we do not yet fully understand the dominant socio-cognitive processes that determine the dynamic, adaptive, and learning behavior of human-AI teams. Of especial interest are intellective tasks with uncertainty and limited resources: what are the rational, efficient, or irrational strategies and heuristics that humans tend to adopt in such circumstances? The lack of established theories is important because it leads to a lack of rigorous design principles and guidelines. Useful socio-cognitive models should inform the design of efficient AI agents that improve the overall human-AI team performance. In other words, empirically-validated models and theories are needed to model and build the human-AI teams of the future and to intervene when their performance deteriorates. This proposal's broad objective is the development and experimental validation of a theory of coordination of human-Al teams in complex intellective tasks. We plan to combine fundamental insights and models of team behavior from social sciences with state-of-the-art machine learning and dynamical systems methods. Specifically, our objective include: (1) modeling socio-cognitive structures in human-Al teams, including transacti ve memory systems, influence systems, and prospect theories; (2) identifying leading cognitive processes, heuristics and biases that underlie the formation of socio-cognitive structures and affect the accuracy of human-Al team decision making; (3) designing supervisory/coordinating AI agents in human-AI teams, based on a few leading concepts from applied psychology and machine learning, and testing/validating them in sequential, risky, uncertain decision making tasks; and (4) modeling how human-AI teams cope with limited training data acquired over short sessions, including how they react to various manipulations and intervention schemes. Our technical approach combines human-AI experiments, socio-cognitive theoretical modeling, and mathematical and statistical analysis. Specifically, we propose a sequence of increasingly-complex elaborations of a basic intellective task with various types of AI agents. The task involves decision making under limited resource allocation and uncertainty. In our experiments, AI agents will play the role of expert systems with unknown accuracy and of supervisory/coordinating agents. The proposed human-AI experiment will be executed on our software Platform for Online Group Studies (POGS), that is a general framework for conducting online experiments involving real-time collaboration. The proposed modeling and validation efforts will lead to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the broad field of Socio Cognitive Networks. We envision that our empirically-validated models will shed light onto the general principles describing human-AI teams, including adaptation and learning phenomena as well as their impact on team performance in intellective tasks motivated by Army's applications. We will be able to identify and distinguish efficient high-performance cognitive processes, as compared with heuristic processes that may lead to inaccurate decision making. Our empirically-validated designs of supervisory/coordinating AI agents will provide various baseline designs, inspired by fundamental socio-cognitive concepts and machine learning tools.

Approach: The proposed research will develop Plasticity which introduces binary shims that decouple/bridge the controller to the control bus. Plasticity complements and completes BFT++, a defenses based on software diversity and delayed input sharing being developed at ONR for achieving cyber-attack resilient integrated control systems (such as SCADA, Navy’s shipboard HM&E systems). The shims introduce flexible and programmable filtering capabilities that can be updated at runtime. They provide the defender with the ability to remove inputs from the device that are known (or suspected) to crash the firmware. As a result, the firmware protected by Plasticity has the ability to defend itself from malicious inputs and commands, breaking out of the crash-recover cycle. Plasticity also extends the firmware with crash forensics capabilities that analyze the execution state of the firmware to determine the root cause of a crash. This information is used to automatically generate input filters to prevent the firmware from repeated crashing due to attacker attempts to launch a similar attack after the firmware has recovered from the initial attack. Limited hardware resources and frequent real-time constraints on execution make efficient filter generation and enforcement a primary design goal. A significant amount of effort is often invested to demonstrate that the worst-case execution time of a section of code does not exceed a budget. If the device fails to meet its real-time deadlines, its outputs could be incorrect and cause harm to the cyber-critical system, representing yet another type of failure that attackers could attempt to exploit. While it is necessary for the shims be inline with input processing, it is expected that the forensics code inserts only minimal (optimally, no) code into the execution paths of the firmware. It is expected that this component is invoked only when a crash or other failure is detected. Based on the firmware execution state, together with knowledge of the firmware gleaned from an initial static analysis, it is the task of this component to piece together the root cause of the crash. This means that the forensic component should be able to identify the inputs that led to the crash, as well as the vulnerable program point.

0,Plasticity: Protection and Crash Forensics for Embedded Devices,United States Department of the Navy,to Christopher Kruegel,"Plasticity: Protection and Crash Forensics for Embedded Devices Embedded devices are ubiquitous. They often handle privacy-sensitive information, a fact that will only become more important as the movement towards the “Internet of Things” (IoT) gains traction. Moreover, they also often play a central role in critical infrastructure, for instance by managing key mechanical systems as part of industrial control systems in the energy and transportation sectors. Errors in the software running on these devices can have devastating impacts, in particular when an adversary is able to exploit vulnerabilities in order to cause severe failures in the physical world. As such, ensuring the security and reliability of such devices is of paramount importance. Embedded devices commonly execute proprietary firmware, where users of the devices have no access to the source code and only little documentation is available. Moreover, due to realtime constraints, hardware limitations, or scalability concerns, this firmware often runs as a single high authority protection domain without an operating system. As with common off-the-shelf (COTS) software, firmware is susceptible to a wide range of errors such as memory corruption flaws, command injection vulnerabilities, and logic flaws where successful exploits directly lead to catastrophic failures. In these cases, adversaries can immediately obtain highly privileged access to the underlying hardware and systems these devices control to carry out devastating attacks. In this project, we propose to develop a system we call PLASTICITY that complements and completes existing defenses based on software diversity and delayed input sharing. The first component of the system allows the defender to transparently introduce shims into firmware images to decouple the firmware from the inputs that are received from attached physical sensors. These shims introduce flexible and programmable filtering capabilities that can be updated at runtime. They provide the defender with the ability to remove inputs from the device that are known (or suspected) to crash the firmware. As a result, the firmware protected by PLASTICITY has the ability to defend itself from malicious inputs and commands, breaking out of the crash-recover cycle.

0,Exotic Transport Properties and Unique Applications of Intercalated van der Waals Materials,United States Department of the Army,to Kaustav Banerjee,"Intercalation is the process of inserting in-plane Ôguest molecules' between adjacent atomic sheets in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials such as graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Moreover, such intercalated compounds can be engineered to exhibit exotic electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical, piezoelectric, superconducting or magnetic properties that may not exist in nature. While some studies on graphite intercalation compounds can be found in the literature but there is very limited information on intercalation of TMDs and other vdW materials, which can lead to new scientific discoveries and novel applications that were once inconceivable. In this project, we propose to explore and study such prope1ties in intercalated-vdW materials and identify their unique applications. Intercalated vdW materials provide a unique pathway to elicit material properties akin to two-dimensional (2D) systems without the need for mechanical exfoliation or direct synthesis of a 2D material. An essential feature that makes a single layer (or a pure 2D system) different from multilayer (or bulk vdW materials) is that it is free of vdW type interlayer interactions, which has opened up the world of 2D materials. Intercalation of few-layer, multilayer, or bulk vdW materials is a unique approach to realize a 2D material system by decoupling or weakening the inter-layer vdW interactions. Compared to single layer 2D crystals, intercalated vdW materials could be more beneficial, in ten.ns of stability, robustness, manufacturability, and property manipulation. Currently, such intercalated systems are still in their infancy, and demands more extensive research efforts to uncover various exotic physics and applications uniquely enabled by them. The excitement behind this research plan is founded on promising results from our research efforts, such as magnetic intercalates in bilayer [1] and few-layer [2] graphene, as well as use of alkali intercalates (such as Li) for energy storage (Kim group) [3] and halogen intercalates (such as Br-) for eliciting kinetic inductance in a multilayer graphene inductor that has helped overcome a nearly 200 years old dilemma in electromagnetics (Banerjee group) [4]. Specifically, we will explore a wider range of intercalates (including alkali, alkali-earth/rare-earth metals, chlorides, halides, fluorides, etc.) as well as bi- or tri-intercalation of various vdW materials. Concurrently, we plan to apply our understanding of the exotic prope1ties (from superconducting to magnetic) of intercalated vdW materials for designing novel applications, which are uniquely enabled by the uncovered novel physics in this project.

0,Controlling Catalysis at Metal Nanoparticle Surfaces by Direct Photo-excitation of Absorbate-Metal Bonds,United States Department of the Army,to Phillip Christopher,"In this project we will perform fundamental research aimed at elucidating pathways to enable control of chemical reactivity at catalytic metal surfaces through direct photoexcitation of adsorbate-metal bonds. Direct photoexcitation of molecular bonds offers a unique approach to manipulate chemical reactivity by matching photon excitation wavelengths to bond-specific electronic transitions or vibrational modes, but has primarily been utilized in single-phase molecular systems. Developing approaches to confine the direct photoexcitation mechanism to adsorbate-metal bonds has the potential to significantly reduce the required energy input to break bonds, compared to single phase systems, while maintaining high levels of specificity in guided bond breaking and making. Although this approach offers significant promise for controlling catalytic chemistry, experimental evidence and mechanistic insights defining approaches to induce photocatalysis by direct adsorbate-metal bond photoexcitation are scarce. The central hypothesis explored in this proposal is that the use of sub 5 nm nanoparticles as photocatalysts and the inclusion of a background thermal energy source will uniquely enable direct photoexcitation as the dominant mechanism driving catalytic chemistry under low intensity photon flux. The large surface area to volume ratio of sub 5 nm nanoparticles will force photon absorption onto surface sites where direct photoexcitation adsorbate-metal bonds is possible, while background thermal excitation will increase the probability that photoexcitation of adsorbate-metal bonds will result in a chemical reaction. The overall objective of the research proposed here is to develop a holistic understanding of catalysis on metal nanoparticles surfaces driven by direct photoexcitation of adsorbate-metal bonds and the knowhow to exploit this phenomenon to manipulate reaction selectivity. The specific project objectives are: (1) Develop models that relate the nature of adsorbate-metal bond formation to the oscillator strength and energy of induced dipole electronic transitions (2) Uncover governing factors that control the efficiency of chemical reactions on metal nanoparticle driven by direct adsorbate-metal bond photo-excitation. (3) Identify strategies to enhance the efficiency of direct photoexcitation driven chemical reactions on metal nanoparticles. (4) Demonstrate control of reaction selectivity by resonance between visible photon excitation and electronic transitions localized in targeted adsorbate-metal bonds To achieve these objectives we will use in-situ spectroscopic techniques, photocatalytic reaction quantification and quantum chemical calculations. We will focus primarily on the chemistry of (CO, NO, HCN, CH4, CH3OH and furfural) on transition and noble metal surfaces (Pt, Pd, Rh and Cu) to develop mechanistic insights into photocatalysis on metal nanoparticles by direct adsorbate-metal bond photoexcitation. These insights will be applied to demonstrate unique approaches to control selectivity in preferential CO oxidation, selective molecular desorption (CO vs. NO), furfural hydrogenation or decomposition and alkene hydroformylation reactions. The proposed research has the potential to introduce new mechanisms to achieve high selectivity in catalytic reactions at surfaces, which could have significant impact for emerging Army interests in photochemical catalysis for water splitting, CO2 reduction, remediation of waste and others. We expect that the proposed research will have a significant impact on the broad catalysis community, sparking the interest of chemical engineers, chemists, materials scientists and surface physicists.

Recent advances have demonstrated successful control of systems as large as 50 physical quantum bits (qbits) in trapped atom and superconducting qubit systems. However, the highest impact applications of quantum computing require comparable numbers of logical qubits, operating free of errors. Topological quantum computation offers an alternate path. In this paradigm, qubits are constructed from degrees of freedom in a solid state material that, by virtue of the entanglement structure of the states from which they arise, are fundamentally immune to decoherence. This proposal seeks to realize topological qubits leveraging the full protection of quantum information afforded by the long range entanglement native to certain strongly correlated states of electrons. These include Fibonacci anyons, whose richer topological degeneracies enable full fault-tolerant quantum computation without high-overhead error correcting techniques. Our proposal relies on the prior discovery by our group that that bilayer graphene currently provides the most robust material platform in which nonabelian anyons are known to exist, including Fibonacci anyons. Our program is based on building quantum dots deep in a two dimensional sample bulk which can localize single fractionally charged anyons. Dispersive gate sensing will be used to measure this fractional charge, paving the way for double dot experiments that measure the energy difference between contrasting nonabelian fusion outcomes. Finally, multidot systems will be built that enable a complete braiding of disting nonabelian anyons—constituting the first true topological qubit incorporating initialization, a gate operation, and readout. Successful implementation of this program would result in realistic assessments of topological qubits for scaled up quantum information processing.less","999,998",2020,2025

The research project will encompass two specific aims: 1) Identify the optimal combination of osmolytes required to stabilize water-soluble proteins in non-cellular environments A novel two-dimensional microfluidic gradient generator will be developed and used to screen various osmolytes to determine the optimal combination and concentration needed to stabilize two model proteins, glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase within a hydrogel matrix. Protein stability will be assessed via activity assays performed colorimetrically, fluorometrically or electrochemically under a range of environmental stressors, including high temperatures, strong electric fields, high concentrations of denaturing agents, and multiple freeze/thaw and desiccation cycles. (2) Reproducibly and reliably controlling the intermolecular spacing of proteins to enhance stability Proteins will be covalently attached to a polymer matrix with precise control over intermolecular spacing to prevent molecules that unfold from colliding with other molecules and aggregating. Block copolymer lithography will be used to generate precise nanoscale patterns with long-range order. A block copolymer will be designed to generate a cylindrical phase, and the cylinder-forming domains will contain functional groups to which the proteins will be covalently attached. The cylindrical domain spacing will be modified to assess the impact of protein spacing on protein stability under a variety of environmental conditions. A library of block copolymers with different morphologies will be generated allowing systematic analysis of the effect of protein spacing between 15-60 nm.less","998,000",2016,2019
0,Tasks and Transitions: An Investigation of Transactive Memory Systems in Teams Performing Multi-Task Activities,United States Department of the Army,to Kyle Lewis,"Intelligent machines are being deployed as human assistants in a variety of corporate, military, and healthcare settings. Research has generally examined how intelligent machines affect individual human behavior, but very few studies explore how intelligent machines impact teams and teamwork. We examine the performance and processes of teams using an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) to complete a collaborative task. We chose a collaborative intellective task, which is characterized by right and wrong answers. We expected that IPA use would enhance team performance on an intellective task but interfere with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS). A TMS is a collective memory system that, once developed, has strong positive effects on sustained team performance. Our findings show that IPA use may be harmful to the development of an efficient TMS, but teamsÕ awareness of its knowledge distribution mitigates this negative effect. We continue to investigate explanations for our initial findings. With recorded videos of team interactions, we plan to examine these underlying mechanisms by interpreting team member communication and IPA usage during the intellective task. We highlight the need for new theorizing about the generative and destructive impacts of intelligent machine use in teams.less","951,801",2015,2019
0,A wearable platform supporting high-frequency measurements of molecular performance markers,United States Department of the Navy,to Kevin Plaxco,"Our ability to monitor metabolites, hormones, and other biomarkers indicative of and predictive for human performance has been hamstrung by the lack of generalizable platform technologies capable of measuring the concentrations of arbitrary molecules in vivo, in real-time, and with frequency that is rapid relative to the timescale of biologically relevant fluctuations. That is, although a small number of metabolites (glucose, pyruvate, lactate) can be measured in situ in the body with physiologically-relevant, seconds time resolution, the sensors supporting these measurements rely critically on the specific chemical (enzymatic or redox) reactivity of their target analytes, and thus it is not possible to adapt them to the broader problem of monitoring molecules indicative of human physiological and psychological status. There are, for example, no existing sensors that can monitor hormones, the large majority of metabolites, or any protein biomarkers, all of whose limited reactivity is incompatible with prior in vivo detection schemes. Recently, however, we demonstrated a platform technology, termed electrochemical aptamer- based sensors, that, in contrast to all prior sensing approaches, is independent of the chemical reactivity of its targets, supports seconds resolved molecular measurements of specific molecular targets even when placed in situ in the living body. In support of this claim, we have, to date, validated 10 sensors (measuring a wide range of metabolites, drugs, and proteins) in vivo using a live rodent model. To advance this technology for human performance applications (i.e., to close the remaining “knowledge gap”), we propose here the steps necessary to convert this technology into a wearable, minimally invasive (sub-dermal microneedle) format supporting the convenient, real-time, multi-day monitoring of multiple molecular analytes in humans. The successful outcome of the proposed research program would be the development and initial validation of a platform technology that would promote warfighter resiliency and enhance performance under extreme operational conditions. It will do so by providing real-time, molecular-level read outs of multiple metabolites, hormones and biomarkers indicative of metabolism, health, and stress, thus providing an unprecedented, minute-to-minute window into physiological status via a wireless, wearable, minimally invasive and cost-effective device.less","950,000",2020,2023

0,Comprehensive Spatial Testing for Selection and Training,United States Department of the Navy,to MARY HEGARTY,"Spatial intelligence is a central aspect of human intellectual functioning. It is predictive of both participation and success in careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pursuits, even after controlling for verbal and mathematical intelligence (Shea, Lubinski & Benbow, 2001; Wai, Lubinski & Benbow, 2009). Attention to the spatial domain is particularly important in selection and training in computationally or technically demanding jobs (Smith, 196vy.Spatial intelligence is also important for everyday navigation tasks, such as learning the layout of a new place, maintaining a se systematic study of navigation ability is relatively recent (Hegarty & Waller, 2005; Wolbers & Hegarty, 2010) and we are just beginning to develop standardized measures of this aspect of spatial ability (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2018).Using spatial tests for selection for technical careers and navigation challenges required for success in todays Navy is an attractive option. However, many existing tests of spatial ability were developed in the early to mid 20th century and may not test the most relevant skills for todays Navy. In addition, most tests of spatial ability have not benefitted from recent psychometric techniques such as item response theory, and existing tests do not measure the broad range of spatially intelligent tasks in which military personnel must engage. The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) contains just one spatial task (the Object Assembly test) and a test of the related construct of Mechanical Comprehension. The proposed project aims to develop a battery of tests that provides a reliable and comprehensive assessment of important spatial skills for military selection and training.To achieve the goal, we need research to tackle twobasic issues:Issue 1: Do tests with the same name measure the same construct? Tests with the same name that purportedly measure thesame cognitive process (e.g., mental rotation, cross sectioning, perspective taking) may actually tap different capabilities; testswith different names may tap the same ability. We simply do not know enough about what current tests measure to make effective recommendations regarding personnel selection or job placement. The first goal of this project is to provide the evidence necessary for making decisions about which tests of a particular construct are best, for every construct we decide to evaluate. The question of what skills to evaluate brings us, however, to the second issue.Issue 2: What constructs should we include in the domain of spatial skills? Historically, measures of spatial abilities were based on small-scale tasks, measuring ability to imagine transformations objects that are smaller than the body and can be apprehended from a single viewpoint. In contrast, large scale or environmental spatialabilities refer to the ability to think about spaces that are larger than the body and that we learn about as we explore or navigate through space were not included (Hegarty & Waller, 2005). The study of large-scalenvironmental spatial intelligence is relatively recent, but there has been significant progress in understanding this essential aspect of intelligence in recent including the development of standardized measures of this ability in virtual environments (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2016; 2018). This project will developand validate online measures of both small scale (object manipulation) and large scale (navigation) spatial abilities and provide the evidence necessary for determining the structure of spatial intellect and what tests to include in an overall batteryApproved forPublic Release.less","894,741",2021,2023

The underlying stategy of the research approach is to improve the MBE growth synchronously with the device development, with each stage of device characterization feeding back into the MBE optization. Initial materials research will focus on controlling the band structure of the epilayers. Point defects introduced during growth can cause the Fermi level to be above or below the Dirac points, which could destroy the linear energy dispersion. GaSb and lnSb buffer layers will be explored, with growth on GaAs or GaSb. Magneto transport studies will investigate the thickness and stain dependence of the band structure. Transport studies under an applied electric field will establish materials quality, density of states, and band gap characterization. Electrical measurements, in particular of carrier densities and mobilities, will guide materials parameter optimization. These studies will also provide a fundamental understanding of the scattering mechanisms (which are not presently well understood and are substantially different from those in semiconductors) as a function of materials quality, temperature, and Fenni level (unintentional doping).

0,Probing Driven Quantum Gases and Enhancing Professional Development Pathways at a Minority Serving Institution,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to David Weld,"When the position of one of the mirrors in a resonant optical cavity is strongly modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of optical energy. Strikingly, photons in such a driven cavity stroboscopically obey the equations for light propagating in a curved spacetime. This prediction has been theoretically explored for nearly 50 years but has resisted a complete experimental realization, due to the extreme difficulty of moving mirrors close to the speed of light. We propose to circumvent this difficulty by experimentally realizing these emergent driven-cavity phenomena in a quantum gas with relativistic dispersion and a very low effective speed of light. Resulting quantitative insights into emergent time-domain order will reach beyond regimes treated by current theories and guide future chip-based realizations, with the potential to enable new techniques for optical signal compression, energy manipulation, multiplexing, and sensing. A second key goal of the proposed work is to increase the number of graduates, including underrepresented minorities, in defense-relevant STEM fields. As a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Barbara faces a critical need to address student academic and career preparation to better serve the changing demographics of our student body. To address this goal, the PI of this proposal worked with a previous DoD HBCU/MI award (W911NF2010294) to found the ÒUCSB SACNAS Career Pathways Program.Ó This successful program, for which we request continuing support in this proposal, has helped hundreds of URM STEM students at UCSB, supporting their career preparation with four main activities: a new professional development workshop series; individualized career training and mentoring for graduate students and postdocs; a physics textbook library for economically disadvantaged students; a travel grant program for UCSB and UC-HBCU students to attend scientific conferences and collaboratively visit other institutions; and direct research participation by one postdoc, one graduate student researcher, and one undergraduate researcher each year (the latter two supported by non-DoD funding). In partnership with the UCSB SACNAS graduate student chapter and the graduate division, professional development workshops will continue to be developed and disseminated both at UCSB and at national professional meetings such as SACNAS or APS.

0,Probing Microscopic Transport Processes in Organic and Hybrid Materials using Ultrafast Electron Imaging,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Bolin Liao,"Organic and hybrid electronic materials are being increasingly used to make flexible electronic devices, organic LEDs, photovoltaics and photodetectors. For example, organic/inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have attracted intense research interest recently due to the rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices based on them, now well over 20%. Microscopic transport processes play a significant role in determining the performance of devices based on organic and hybrid electronic materials. On one hand, the intriguing charge transfer processes in these materials, often mediated by excitons and polarons, need to be optimized but are challenging to characterize with existing tools with limited spatial and temporal resolutions. On the other hand, the heat transport and ion migration processes in these materials have increasingly been recognized to be critical to the long-term stability and efficiency of the devices but remain less explored. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to combine first-principles materials modeling with state-of-the-art ultrafast electron microscopy and optical spectroscopy to systematically examine the interplay of charge, heat and ion transport in organic and hybrid materials and unravel the influence of these microscopic transport processes on the physical properties of both uniform materials and device-relevant heterostructures. In particular, we will take advantage of the UCSB scanning ultrafast electron microscope (SUEM), which is a newly developed photon-pump-electron-probe technique that combines the temporal resolution of ultrafast lasers with the spatial resolution of scanning electron microscopes. Our research will provide new fundamental insights into microscopic energy transfer and conversion processes in organic and hybrid electronic materials and devices and will enable new applications of these emerging materials in energy harvesting, sensing and wearable devices that are of DoD interests. In addition to the scientific program, we will closely integrate research with education on both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Graduate and undergraduate researchers will participate in the proposed research and learn research skills in materials science, thermal physics and ultrafast optical spectroscopy and electron microscopy.

We focus on two related effects. The quantum anomalousHall (QAH) effect hosts chiral edge states arising from magnetic ordering, generating a quantizedHall effect at zero magnetic field. Besides providing a low-cost resistance standard, quantumanomalous Hall systems may provide novel mechanisms for magnetoelectric coupling, with applicationsin low power memory and spintronics.

In the case of the quantum anomalousHall effect, for example, conventional approaches are limited to realizing the effect at sub-kelvintemperature scales, several orders of magnitude below the magnetic ordering temperatures. Forquantum spin Hall systems, electrons propagate less than a micron before backscattering.The proposed work will develop new, robust realizations of these phenomena using van derWaals heterostructureslayered stacks of two dimensional crystals fabricated by aligned transferof atomically thin crystals.

Because of this, frequency allocations in UHF are typically small, on the order of tens of kHz. At the same time, there is an increasing popularity of aerial platforms, such as UAVs, containing a variety of imaging systems. So, while there may be numerous UAVs in a particular region of interest, there is no current mechanism to send this high-rate data directly to ground forces. We propose to develop a wireless communication system that is able to transmit high-rate imagery (> 1 Mbps) over a traditional narrow-band voice channel (25 kHz). Our proposed approach is based on a spatial multiplexing architecture applied to MIMO antenna arrays. The technique works well in non line of sight environments, such as those found between low-flying UAVs and urban ground forces. Taking into account practical operational conditions, where either friendly or hostile forces may employ jamming, the architecture can mitigate jamming signals that are significantly higher power than the signal of interest.

This system will include algorithms for dynamic routing and sensor management to support cooperative tracking of one or more moving ground targets and will be demonstrated at an airfield maintained by our subcontractor Advanced Ceramics Research using their Silver Fox UAV. UAV flight paths are periodically computed on a discretization of the search space using dynamic programming and are optimal on the grid with respect to a tradeoff between probability of acquisition and total flight time. Paths will account for terrain and potential obscuration of the targets and will each terminate in a rounded rectangle around the target(s) that respects standoff requirements. Sensor controls are dynamically selected in order to minimize the information-theoretic entropy of a tracking database. Our system will work with electro-optical sensors, mounted on the routable UAVs, and moving target indicator radars, mounted on a fixed-orbit UAV. Cooperative sensor management can exploit the strengths of each type of sensor to provide the data necessary for a system to perform CSAT operations even in the presence of obscuration. We will modify existing open-source software to develop a video tracking module for use by the UAVs. Our current control system, based on a centralized architecture, will be completed and tested under Phase II. We will then evolve this system into a decentralized architecture.

0,Seamless Sensor Network Communications,United States Department of the Air Force,to Richard Cagley,"Wireless communication systems must operate under challenging conditions. For instance, communication between two ground personnel within an urban environment may not be possible; there may be severe fading or attenuation due to the numerous obstacles present. At the same time, this lack of connectivity is seen as unacceptable from the perspective of the radio operator. A recent concept undergoing active research is to increase the reliability of radio systems by making them cooperative. Generally, instead of having a single radio bear the entire burden of communication, coordinated operation between itself and surrounding radios will better accomplish its tasks. Such a concept is the basis for our work on cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Here, a distributed set of radios are able to simultaneously transmit coded data streams that are coherently combined at a central multi-antenna collector. Although the technique may be able to be applied to other radio systems, our current target application is wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the limited resources available to individual wireless sensor nodes, each is severely limited in terms of power and range.

0,Suppressing flow boiling instabilities using surface structures,United States Department of the Navy,to Yangying Zhu,"(Approved for Public Release)The increasing power densities in gallium nitride and gallium oxide power electronics, RF devices and lasers are demanding aggressive thermal management solutions to dissipate high heat fluxes with stable performance. Two-phase flow boiling in micro and mini channels has been proposed as an attractive approach to address this problem due to the high latent heat ofvaporization and compact form factor. However, a critical issue associated with flow boiling is dynamic flow instability which results in sustained oscillations in flow rate, pressure drop and temperature. Extensive theoretical and experimental research has shownthat flow instability results from the interaction and feedback between internal characteristics (pressure drop vs flow rate insidethe two-phase channel) and external (flow loop) characteristics. Different instability modes include Ledinegg instability, pressure-drop oscillations and density-wave oscillations, which correspond to different external characteristics. Recently, micro/nanoscale surface structures have been integrated into flow boiling microchannels. Enhancements in the heat transfer coefficient as well as CHF have been reported. Although the preliminary results are promising, most studies have not investigated these surface-structure coated channels in different flow loops. How surface structure will affect each mode of flow instability has not been studied. The goals of this proposal are to understand the influence of surface structures on different modes of flow boiling instabilities (Ledinegg, density-wave and pressure-drop oscillations), and to enhance heat transfer performance of dielectric fluid microchannel flow boiling using a combination of surface structures and flow loop control. The study will bridge local mechanisms that occur on surface structures within channels to system-level instabilities that result from the interactions and feedbacks between individual channel and flow-loop components. The main tasks of this proposals are:Task 1: We will characterize the internal characteristics (pressure drop vs flow rate) curves for channels with surface structures in various flow loop configurations leading to Ledinegg, density-wave and pressure-drop instabilities, respectively. The internal characteristics of structured surface channels will be compared to smooth surface channels, and flow instabilities for these surface structure and loop combinations will be analyzed. Task 2: We will investigate the role of surface structures on heat transfer characteristics within the channels under different flow instability modes. Using a high-speed infrared camera, we will map the local wall temperature distribution and transient response on the surface structures and correlate them with inlet mass flux oscillations.Task 3: Based on the hydrodynamic and thermal measurements in Tasks 1 and 2, we will extend classical models on flow boiling instabilities to include the effect of surface structures, and generate a regime mapto identify the optimal working conditions with the most heat transfer enhancement and suppressed instability.Task 4: Develop active flow control to enhance dielectric-fluid flow boiling in microchannels with surface structuresThis study will generate a more comprehensive understanding of the role of surface structures in different flow boiling systems, which will guide the development of advanced two-phase thermal management systems highly relevant to DoD applications.As an educational institution, UCSB performs fundamental and unclassified research.

0,The FinMET,National Security Agency,to Christopher Palmstrom,"Planar superconductor based transmon qubits based on the new merged element design will be fabricated using silicon fins as Josephson junctions to form fin-merged element transmons (FinMETs). This new technology will capitalize on the anisotropic etching of specific silicon atomic planes which will be used to define atomically flat, reproducible tunnel barriers with superconducting metal contacts on the side-wall surfaces. This process facilitates the preparation of single crystal barriers while circumventing the problems associated with the incompatibility of low-loss insulating barrier growth with lattice matched superconductors. In addition, it can be expected to address problems with standard superconducting transmon devices by; (1) reducing loss and thus increasing coherence; (2) reducing the formation of two-level system spectral features; (3) improving thickness control, especially when combined with commercial fin-fabrication, resulting in better frequency control; (4) dramatically reducing the footprint; and (5) allowing for more scalable fabrication. The Si fins will be formed using high-purity silicon substrates with a specific crystallographic orientation and will be metallized using aluminum deposition to make the superconducting electrodes. The formation of FinMET devices allows for controllable thickness, length, and height parameters of the tunnel junction using optical lithography and standard semiconductor processes. These devices provide the advantages of uniform fabrication based on existing infrastructure for finFETs while using cost effective bulk wafers and avoiding the use of lossy amorphous dielectrics.less","750,000",2022,2025
0,Demonstration of a Local Carrier-Based Precision Approach and Landing System (LC-PALS),United States Department of the Navy,to Kenan Ezal,"Toyon Research Corporation, together with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) propose to demonstrate a GPS-denied Local Carrier-based Precision Approach and Landing System (LC-PALS) that enables 3-D position, navigation and time (PNT) for platforms within range of an aircraft carrier equipped with one or more ADEPT-compliant beacons. Unlike the Global Positioning System (GPS), which requires four satellite signals, the Adaptive Polarized Navigation (ADEPT) waveform enables PNT with just two beacons. In addition, a single ADEPT-compliant beacon is sufficient if the platform is equipped with a good reference time source.The Phase I effort demonstrated that LC-PALS will achieve 10-cm z-axis (altitude) accuracy, thereby enabling autonomous carrier landing capability under GPS-denied conditions. Moreover, the system has a low probability of detection and intercept (LPD/LPI), significant built-in anti-jam, anti-spoof, and multipath-mitigation capabilities, and is not prone to integer ambiguity and cycle-slip phenomenon that is of concern with other carrier-phase tracking systems. Furthermore, because the system makes use of the same hardware that is required for GPS processing, an ADEPT receiver can be fully integrated with GPS, thereby minimizing redundant hardware and enabling simultaneous operation with GPS, when available. While an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is not required for precision approach and landing, an onboard IMU can be used as an additional and complementary measurement source for improved attitude performance, especially during the end game. While the Phase I program verified the feasibility of LC-PALS, the Phase II program will demonstrate the system under realistic conditions.less","749,995",2015,2017

Regardless of the specific application domain, the primary goal is to design admissible control algorithms that guarantee efficient and reliable behavior for the problem at hand.

0,High-Temperature Environmental Barrier Coating for Silicon Carbide Composites,United States Department of the Air Force,to Derek Hass,"ABSTRACT: Lightweight silicon-based ceramics are leading candidates to replace heavier nickel-based superalloys for use on hot section components in next generation gas turbine engines having increased specific power. However, exposures of these materials to the high temperatures, pressures and velocities of water vapor containing combustion environments alter the effectiveness of thermally grown silica scales in protecting the ceramic components from oxidation and component recession during service. Environmental barrier coatings(EBCs) are therefore required that protect the underlying ceramic substrate from environmental attack. Such coatings require good stability in the presence of water vapor, a mechanism for limiting the transport of oxygen and water vapor, good chemical compatibility at the interface of unlike materials, high temperature phase stability to limit volume changes resulting from phase transformations in the coating materials and the ability to provide thermal and erosion protection. The ongoing drive to promote higher temperature protection and prime reliant performance of these systems has led to interest in advanced thermal/environmental barrier coating(T/EBC) systems having enhanced performance over current state-of-the-art T/EBC systems. In this work, novel coating synthesis techniques that enable the deposition of multilayered T/EBC""s anticipated to have higher temperature capability and improved durability over of current systems are investigated. BENEFIT: This research is anticipated to result in a thermal/environmental barrier coating system that provides higher temperature capability, improved durability and better erosion resistance than current coatings. These advancements will enable the use of Si-based ceramics in a range of high temperature applications such a gas turbine engines and heat exchangers.

Modeling and simulation of the devices will provide in-depth understanding of device functionality. Based on experience from earlier projects, an iterative optimization process will be adopted for device design, consisting of three device generations grown by MBE. The first generation will be a waveguide based design to experimentally prove the basic functionality of high-speed modulation with a third device terminal. In the second generation, the high-speed modulation functionality will be incorporated into a VCSEL structure, with the third generation reserved for optimization of electrode design etc. Anticipated benefits will be to push the operational speed of direct modulated VCSELs well beyond the current limits of ~20 Gbps to ~90-100 Gbps. This technological advancement will enable the use of low cost VCSEL technology as the fundamental building block for both ultra fast future free space and fiber-optical interconnects for high performance computers and server applications.less","749,926",2009,2011
0,Control of Cooperative Engagements with Robust and Distributed Optimization (Concerto(TM)),United States Department of the Air Force,to Gaemus Collins,"Toyon Research Corporation and the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) propose to develop decision and control algorithms for cooperative agents operating under an intermittent asynchronous communication network. Agents will be expected to perform a variety of cooperative missions such as persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), target search, acquisition, and tracking, area denial, and battle damage assessment under dynamically-varying bandwidth limitations, intermittent communications, and limited information. The key feature of the proposed cooperative control system is the use of an estimator-based distributed control (EBDC) architecture, allowing each UAV to internally model and anticipate the actions of the others UAVs. Under this EBDC architecture, the control system can gracefully scale from essentially centralized control (complete and perfect inter-vehicle communication) to completely distributed control (no inter-vehicle communication). The estimator-based distributed architecture models a centralized design by forcing each individual agent in the system to compute future control actions for all agents, as a function of the agents' positions and the global information state (GIS). The quality and amount of communication between agents determines the accuracy of each agent's GIS estimate. Each agent's GIS estimate, in turn, determines the accuracy of each agent's control estimates for the other agents. In this way, the EBDC algorithms transition from an essentially centralized solution to a completely decentralized solution based on the communication rate and information available to each agent within the cooperative network. The performance of the system will be guaranteed to degrade gracefully with the level of information available to each agent, because the EBDC algorithms optimize the control actions based on the existing information instead of attempting to optimize the communication network to allow better throughput. In the Phase II effort, Toyon and UCSB will enhance and refine the EBDC algorithms developed under Phase I. Implementation of these algorithms will continue in both MATLAB and Toyon's higher-fidelity SLAMEM(TM) simulation tool. We will test and demonstrate their effectiveness in cooperative search and tracking scenarios under varying levels of information throughput. Bandwidth limitations, time delays with uncertain intervals, and network topology limitations will be incorporated into the simulation. The extent of reliable communications required to ensure robust cooperative control will be evaluated.less","749,717",2006,2008

Humans are still unsurpassed in their ability to search for objects in visual scenes. To successfully detect objects in cluttered scenes, the human brain is thought to rely on multiple factors: prior probabilities of object occurrence, global scene statistics and object co-occurrence. Machine object detection continues to be one of the hot areas of computer vision, and it attests both to the fundamental importance of the problem and the fact that state-of-the-art algorithms are shy of performing well in practice. We find that the key problems in current FMV data recognition frameworks (speed, accuracy, robustness, clutter, occlusion, change in view) can be overcome by maturing computer vision systems with architectures and components inspired by advances in neuroscience and computational human vision. In Phase I, we have demonstrated a clear path towards the solving small object recognition problem in overhead videos.

The program culminates with a technical presentation and contest for a review panelcomposed of Faculty (UCSB, Community Colleges) and Navy engineers. Each team is composed of one junior/senior UCSB undergraduate and two community college students. Teams are matched with a UCSB graduate student mentor and a Navy engineer mentor. The expanded program will include an academic component where one of the summer projects will continue to be developed during the academic year at UCSB. The team-based structure andopen-ended nature that characterizes PIPELINES projects supports students creative thinking, further developed by training in innovation.

More specifically, we offer to solve the reliability and repeatability problem in memristive devices by utilizing new design and fabrication processes. Specifically to the Air Force, the proposed solution can provide integrated processing platforms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other devices, where the processing speed and parallelism are critical. Proposed memristive devices will allow the development of an faster and more capable DSP and FPGAs for tomorrow""s high speed signal processing, and the development of reliable and repeatable memristive devices will have innumerable potential applications. In Phase I the team developed a first model of the resistive switching in metal-oxide metal memristors and conceived the fabrication process that would provide reliable and repeatable memristor devices. In Phase II the team will improve and experimentally verify the developed model, will optimize fabrication processes and will demonstrated reliable and repeatable fabrication of memristors.

With rapid developments in recent years in the control and isolation of individual atomic-scale quantum elements, quantum technologies are nearing incorporation into commercial technologies and are enabling major breakthroughs in fundamental scientific understanding. Molecular and atomic scale systems are particularly powerful quantum systems because quantum effects are most visible at the smallest of length scales. An outstanding challenge to scalable and efficient quantum technologies is the deterministic, nanometer-scale positioning of atomic-scale systems that exhibit robust quantum coherence, the delicate property of quantum systems that distinguishes them from classical systems. This capability would enable a myriad of long-standing goals including molecular structure imaging with quantum sensors, deterministic entanglement distribution amongst a network of quantum bits, and quantum emulation of many-body condensed matter systems. However the patterning of atomic-scale quantum bits is not possible with current, state-of-the-art lithographic techniques. The proposed work leverages the bio-inspired technology of DNA origami to self-assemble molecular structures that host single atomic spins at deterministic locations with nanoscale precision. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center defects in diamond, a well-developed quantum technology, will be interfaced with these spin systems in order to prepare and readout their quantum properties with simple optical methods. Combining the growing nucleus of quantum science activity in the United States with advanced biophysical and chemical techniques will be vital to further development of quantum technologies.

0,Increasing the Resolution of Neural Connectivity to Infer Neural Encoding,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Ken Kosik,"1. Apply the recurrent neural network configuration, long short term memory (LSTM), as a universal learning core that can predict connectivity maps across independent neuronal networks, classify neurological conditions and transmit synthetic memory traces. Recordings from multiple electrodes in intact animals are commonly used to train a generalized linear model (GLM) and the model is validated by how effectively the GLM filters predict a behavior. We have developed a system that allows us to directly test the predictions derived from a trained GLM. We built a Neural Circuit Probe that is positioned above a multi- electrode array (MEA) and is capable of identifying the specific neuron from which an MEA signal arises and deliver a chemical reagent such as TTX to that specific neuron. In this manner, if the GLM predicts an inhibitory connection to another neuron we can directly validate the prediction. This level of neuronal connectivity prediction has not been previously accomplished. However, the GLM has inherent limitations mainly related to the assumptions required in by its computation. Among the most limiting assumptions is the necessity to set the amount of history used for the predictions. The use of Long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture represents a promising and incompletely explored approach for prediction of spikes. By training a deep neural network with many neural traces, the ÒmachineÓ will learn to recognize the patterns as has been demonstrated for other complex problems such as the board game GO that entail numerous instantiations inaccessible to simple rule-based analyses and storage of all possible configurations. LSTM is particularly wellÐsuited to classify, process and predict time series when, in contrast to the GLM, the time lags between events are very long and of unknown size. 2. Build a patterned neuronal network in which a discrete identified signal from one neuronal ensemble induces bursting and synchronization of a second neuronal ensemble. The input signal serves as a memory trigger analogous to a sensory input and the induced firing considered a memory trace or a perception. We will determine whether these traces will be useful as information packets capable of representing synthetic memories or perceptions in comparison to simulated traces in terms of total information content, energy consumption, efficiency and robustness. Machine performance whether it is a recognition task, or a robotic motor task or a game are all limited by their brittleness or the ability to perform within the very narrow confines of the specific task for which the machine was designed. A synthetic memory or perception or behavior is encoded as a set of waveforms. In an engineered system, distinct waveforms corresponding to a set of physical parametersÑacceleration, speed, and forceÑcan convey the kinetic aspect of touch. Neurons spontaneously connect in a manner that generates waveforms used for computational purposes according to a still obscure logic. Neural computation is energy efficient and robust; however, the basis for these properties remains inaccessible in part to due to methodological limitations for measuring these parameters in a living neural system.less","606,000",2017,2018
0,Topological Junctions,United States Department of the Army,to Susanne Stemmer,"Modem electronic, photonic, and quantum devices are based on interfaces and junctions. The emergence of topological materials as a new class of electronic materials has generated significant theoretical insights not just into their bulk and boundary states, but also the properties of their interfaces. Topological junctions have many unique properties not found at conventional semiconductor interfaces, such as Klein tunneling, electron ""optic"" phenomena, and the possibility of quantum interference phenomena based on unique types of edge states. To date, however, experimental studies of junctions with topological materials have largely focused on their interfaces with superconductors for quantum devices. The main objective of the proposed project is to utilize the excellent transport properties of epitaxial cadmium arsenide thin films, tuned into different topological phases, to realize prototype junctions, including lateral p-n ??unctions and vertical heterojunctions, in a topological material. These junctions represent key ingredients of future device technologies that make use of the unique properties of topological materials. In particular, we will focus on the fundamental properties of these junctions with a view of room temperature applications such as future solid-state devices that can operate in the terahertz frequency range, which is currently difficult to access with conventional semiconductors. Another main goal is to reveal not only the prospects of these junctions for device applications, but also their science.less","600,000",2023,2027
0,12nm InP-based CMOS for Extreme-Speed Logic,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Mark Rodwell,"Building on UCSB's record InP-based NMOS technology, in this program we seek to develop a l 2nm (physical) gate length InP-based CMOS technology for record-speed, moderate-scale logic. The key technology risk to retire is the PMOS gate dielectric. The DOD seeks extremely fast, moderate-scale logic res. 130nm InP HBT ICs are the fastest logic technology, but without a complementary device, these ICs dissipate power even when not switching, dissipating high power in medium to large ICs. FETs in commercial Si VLSI are designed to balance speed and standby power. A custom InP-based CMOS technology will be markedly faster, both because of high III-V carrier velocities and because the FET will be designed for highest speed, not densest integration. This program seeks to develop such a technology. Extreme speed InP-based CMOS is now feasible because of a decade of worldwide development of InP-based NMOS FETs, targeting VLSI at the 7nm node (~15nm Lg). In(Ga)As gives higher on-currents and smaller input capacitances; in larger interconnect-capacitance dominated ICs, the high on-currents provide higher speed than Si, while in smaller FET-capacitance-dominated ICs, the smaller FET capacitances provide further speed benefit. In present III-V NMOS technology, the gate dielectrics are extremely high quality, and FETs to 12nm Lg can be quickly built; a low-parasitic self-aligned III-V MOSFET should have > 1 THz current-gain cutoff frequency. A fast III-V CMOS technology would require in addition a fast III-V P-FET, and this must be integrated with the NMOS device. Recent data suggests that III-V PMOS may be feasible. Unpublished data on InGaAs PMOS capacitors (Stemmer group, UCSB), with HfO2 dielectric show good characteristics, but further PMOS gate dielectric development is needed. As in modern Si finFETs, in III-V, the PFET can be as fast as the N-FET. The key is to change from the [100] to the [011] orientation. This gives very high hole velocities in ultra-thin channels. The III-V P-FET should have ~1 THz current-gain cutoff frequency. In Si finFETs, the fin surfaces are naturally [011]; for III-V CMOS, we will use planar FETs on [011] wafers. The program statement of work is as follows: (1) III-V P-FET DC development, focusing on the gate dielectric and DC test structures. (2) Demonstrate high-current ill-V P-FET at 12nm Lg, focusing on DC parameters and using a fast 4-day non-self-aligned process with 12nm Lg , but with high parasitics and low current-gain cutoff frequencies. (3) Fabricate self-aligned (fast) PMOS and NMOS FETs, on different wafers, measuring DC parameters and bandwidth, and ( 4)integrate PMOS and NMOS on a common wafer, demonstrate a small-scale record-speed digital test ICs.less","600,000",2015,2016
0,III-N Hot Electron Transistors for high-frequency amplification,United States Department of the Navy,to Umesh Mishra,"Short Statement of work Funds are provided to investigate approaches to achieve TeraHertz operation in Hot Electron Transistors. The PI is Prof. Umesh Mishra, the performer is the University of Santa Barbara. This grant has a three year period of performance with total funding of $600,000 This action provides an initial increment of $100K In prior work, N-Polar Hot Electron Transistors (HET)s performed much better than Ga-Polar HETs on base resistance, turn-on voltage, breakdown voltage, and current density. However, high current gain is very difficult to achieve in N-Polar HETs due to unfavorable band shape for the emitter injector barrier. The Ga-Polar HET has much higher current gain, but has lower breakdown voltages, current density and higher base resistance. Since current gain is one of the most important metrics for transistor performance, this effort will investigate device physics for simultaneous improvements in breakdown voltage, base resistance, and current density of Ga-Polar HETs with the goal of device performance approaching THz performance for an amplifier. Approach: This effort will investigate device growth on bulk substrates to reduce the dislocation density in the active area of the device in order to reduce the leakage currents and increase the breakdown voltage. The reduced leakage currents will enable a further investigation of the role of the injection barrier height on the gain and current density of the hot electrons passing through the base. The device structure geometry will be realized with a self-aligned process in order to maximize the frequency performance through the reduction in parasitic capacitances, contact and base resistance. Objective: The objective of this effort is to investigate device physics for simultaneous improvements in breakdown voltage, base resistance, current density and current gain of Ga-Polar HETs with the goal of device performance approaching THz performance for an amplifier. Merit/relevance The HET is a leading device approach for high frequency vertical transistors in the GaN materials system.

0,Strain-engineered N-Polar GaN HEMTs for High Gain mm-wave Operation,United States Department of the Navy,to Umesh Mishra,"In the past years scaled N-polar HEMTs have demonstrated output power densities beyond 8 W/mm and PAEs of 30% at 94 GHz, a breakthrough performance in solid state mm-wave amplifiers. In order to further improve gain and efficiency of these devices we propose to break the material limits of GaN through strain-engineered electron velocity enhancement, an approachwhich has been implemented with remarkable success in silicon. The dominant factor in ft in a well-designed device with reduced parasitics is the transit time in the channel given by the ratio of gate length and the average electron velocity in the channel. We propose to increase the electron velocity in the channel by using a larger lattice constant material, such as relaxed InGaN, as the channel material which provides a reduced electron effective mass, critical in reducing electron scattering and enhancing electron velocity. The 2DEG mobility in an 20%InGaN channel has been predicted to be more than 5000 cm2/Vs as calculated by Yarar et al.. In the absence of InGaN substrates, the relaxed InGaN material will be fabricated using porous GaN. Our recent investigations have shown that InGaN layers on top of porous GaN relax and adopt an in plane lattice constant larger than GaN, a process enabled by the reduced stiffness of porous GaN. Thereby the upper InGaN layers are compliant. Upon consecutive InGaN regrowth,the InGaN lattice constants further increase. In order to serve as base layers for transistors agrowth process for semi-insulating InGaN layers will be developed. A process for the growth of(Al,Ga)N strained to InGaN will be devised as well. Using a pseudo-substrate with 50% InGaNthe fabricated HEMTs are expected to show an ft of over 230GHz and an fmax over 800GHz.We believe that strain engineering is the next major path to enable the demonstration of highperformance III-nitride HEMTs operating in the deep mm-wave spectrum.less","600,000",2020,2023
0,Highly Scaled N-polar GaN HEMTs for Ultra-High Efficiency at W-Band,United States Department of the Navy,to Umesh Mishra,"The nitrogen-polar (N-polar) gallium nitride (GaN) deep recess high electron mobility transistor structure has recently demonstrated exceptional large-signal performance at millimeter-wave frequencies. Within W-band, at 94 GHz, up to 8 W/mm of output power density has been obtained which represents a 4x improvement over traditional gallium-polar (Ga-polar) devices at similar frequencies while maintaining a high power-added efficiency in excess of 27%. These observed performance benefits of N-polar GaN arise from device design advantages associated with the inverted polarization-induced electric fields relative to a Ga-polar GaN-based transistor. For millimeter-wave devices in particular, the addition of a GaN cap layer in the device access regionsprovides the dual advantage of increased access region conductivity with control over dispersion. While excellent performance has been obtained from this device structure to date, room remains to further improve gain and efficiency of this device technology. The current N-polar GaN deep recess device is most limited by gain. Therefore, in this work we propose to extend this device to higher frequency operation by addressing multiple factors to increase the gain of transistor. To increase gain, both lateral and vertical device scaling will be implemented. Improvements to the epitaxial growth by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition will be used to vertically scale the channel while maintaining high conductivity. Lateral scaling will be addressed by themodifications to the fabrication process.less","600,000",2020,2023

Recent work showed the importance of integrating biologicalsynaptic plasticity mechanisms into SNNs,operation to achieve better functionality. Theproposal's overarching goal is to develop novel materials and devices for implementing,artificial synapses with plasticity mechanisms similar to biological counterparts, specificallymimicking neoHebbian plasticity.At th,e core of our proposal is mixed ionic-electronic materials with two (or more) types ofinteracting mobile ion species with drasticall,y different mobilities to emulate short- and longtermsynaptic memory. Mobile ionic species can be moved by the electric field (and p,ossiblyother types of external factors), which in turn result in a nonlinear change of electricalconductance that is suitable for mi,micking complex plasticity rules. For example, modulationof the concertation profile of faster ionic species could affect the mobili,ty of slower ionicspecies to emulate coupling between eligibility and synaptic weight state variables ofneoHebbian synapses.A partic,ular focus is ,ydrogen protons. In our preliminarywork, we have identified several candidate device structures for implementing neoHebbiansynapses., The most conservative (less challenging but sparser) approach involves two separate(slow and fast) titanium oxide memory devices th,at are integrated with conventional silicontransistors to provide the required coupling. A more advanced, much denser device is base,d ona single structure in which oxygen vacancy mobility is directly modulated by proton doping,e.g. by changing the vacancy charge s,tate.The proposed research involves coordinated theoretical and experimental tasks.

0,Designing Microbial Consortia for Conversion of Wet Waste to Commodity Chemicals,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Michelle O'Malley,"The US Army deploys thousands of soldiers to diverse locations each year, leading to the generation of a tremendous amount of wet waste, primarily in the form of food, paper, and organic scraps on base. These irregular waste streams (due to unpredictable soldier deployment) lead to equally unpredictable compositions of associated waste streams. Though anaerobic digestors can be used to capture some of this waste and convert it to useful products (e.g. methane-rich biogas for fuel), the microbes within such digestors are largely undefined and suffer from a lengthy amount of lag time before any product is detectable. This project seeks to reduce this lag time, largely by seeding anaerobic digestors with a stable "" core '' of naturally occurring microbes (microbial consortia) that could be deployed to convert organic waste into commodity chemicals. These microbes could also be engineered to convert any excess metabolic end product from anaerobic digestion to a chemical of interest directly on Army sites. To accomplish this goal, we will ( 1) enrich & isolate biomass-degrading microbes from natural environments (herbivore guts & ocean sediments), (2) construct new metabolic models to understand & direct microbial partnership, and (3) develop new culture strategies to promote consortia stability against environmental peturbations. This plan will also engage graduate student trainees with researchers at the US Army Research Laboratory, who will partner with us to test the scalability & tolerance of microbial consortia against waste materials. In this way, we will increase trainee exposure to DoD-relevant research, and expand their DoD professional network.

Multivalent batteries, such as those based on Mg(II), Zn(II), or Al(III), improve volumetric energy density, reduce cost, and enhance device safety over lithium-ion batteries. However, advances are required to develop electrolytes that enable stable cycling for rechargeable systems. We propose a design strategy for polymer electrolytes with enhanced mechanical and electrochemical stability over organic liquids based on polymers with pendant ligands. The pendant ligands promote metal salt dissociation with mobility controlled by the kinetics of the metal-ligand binding, combined with the segmental mobility of the polymer backbone. Preliminary results indicate that because the metal cation forms multi-ligand coordination bonds, these bonds act as transient cross-links dramatically improving the modulus of the materials without hindering ionic conductivity. This proposal incorporates an integrated strategy of polymer backbone and ligand design with detailed studies of ionic mobility, conductivity, and transport number. The goal of this research program is to gain a deep understanding of the factors that control multivalent cation conduction in polymer electrolytes by establishing a structure-activity-relationship (SAR), and then exploiting those insights to produce polymer electrolytes with unprecedented levels of ion conduction. This will be achieved by combining the expertise of a polymer electrolyte expert, with state-of-the-art polymer synthesis capabilities, and synthetic and analytical expertise of an inorganic chemist, with a deep knowledge of cation-ligand interactions. Polymer electrolyte performance will be evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and solid-state, pulsed-field gradient NMR experiments, along with general characterization of polymer dynamics by rheometry and calorimetry. Design rules for enhancing cation transport will be developed through iterative measurement, synthesis, and design of polymers and the ligating groups in these polymers.

These projects require structural and chemical information that go beyond the capabilities of the existing facilities for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at UCSB. They include the need for obtaining threedimensional information about the local structure of point defects, low-dose imaging with atomic resolution of low-dimensional materials, detection of light elements, the characterization of quantum materials at low temperatures, and further advancement of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques. These needs could be met by the proposed acquisition of a stateof- the art field emission TEM/STEM with aberration correction (probe corrector). This instrument will not only dramatically improve the spatial resolution, but also, in combination with newly developed detectors, allow for new modes of imaging and spectroscopy, dramatically advancing the information that can be obtained from STEM images. The proposed instrument will be located in the Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility at UCSB. It will be available on an open basis to all members of the University and surrounding community, which includes the local defense industry, ensuring access to the instrument in a wide range of defense-related research projects.

0,Solid-State Thermal Switching by Controlling Soft Phonons and Crystal Symmetry,United States Department of the Navy,to Bolin Liao,"Approved for Public Release)Solid-state thermal switches, whose thermal conductivity can be significantly changed with high speeds,,would enable transformative capabilities aligned with the DoD's mission. These include flexible thermal management of fast-charging,batteries, electronics on spacecrafts, biomedical devices, and potential realization of thermal logic devices, computers and neural,networks. Existing thermal switches, however, do not meet the requirements for these applications. The main difficulty is the lack o,f control due to the weak response of the heat-carrying lattice vibrations (phonons) to external stimuli.To address this challenge,,we propose to develop the fundamental understanding of a novel approach to realize solid-state thermal switches by tuning soft phono,ns and controlling crystal symmetry breaking. We aim to identify promising thermal-switching materials combining state-of-the-art fi,rst-principles modeling and phonon/thermal characterization techniques. Based on the fundamental understandings, we will collaborate, with material scientists to develop fabrication techniques and devices that allow for thermal switches that can be integrated into,a wide range of existing electronic and energy systems. We organize our efforts in three main Tasks:Task 1 will focus on controlling, the ultrasoft optical phonons in topological semimetals due to strong electron-phonon coupling caused by Kohn anomalies associated,with the Dirac nodes. External electric field can sensitively tune the size of the Fermi surface, leading to significant change of p,honon scattering and the lattice thermal conductivity. We will also explore using topological phase transitions induced by pressure,or strain.Task 2 will focus on the soft ferroelectric phonon modes in tunable dielectric oxides near their ferroelectric transitions,. The frequency of the ferroelectric phonon modes can be significantly influenced by an external electric field, enabling large chan,ge of the phonon scattering phase space and thus the lattice thermal conductivity.Task 3 will combine group theory with first-princi,ples simulations to elucidate the impact of crystal symmetry breaking on the phonon scattering selection rules in high-symmetry mate,rials. We will experimentally verity the theoretical predictions by examining electric field and strain gradient induced symmetry br,eaking.Furthermore, novel application concepts enabled by effective solid-state thermal switches will be explored, including neuromo,rphic computing with thermal neural networks and simultaneous switching of conduction and radiation for spacecrafts. If successful,,this program will not only enable the development of high-performance thermal switches, but also establish new materials, theory and, characterization techniques for the thermal transport research.As an educational institution, UCSB performs fundamental and unclass,ified research.

After decades of research from hardware to qua,ntum algorithms, present-day noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) has now achieved quantum supremacy, albeit in contrived computa,tional tasks. This project aims to develop probabilistic computers (PCs) to tackle a similar question: Can PC so to perform all exis,ting methods to solve some practical problem better, faster or more efficiently than any other method? Unlike all known candidates f,or QC, PCs can operate at room temperature and they can be built in many different hardware platforms including nanoscale devices wi,th demonstrated scalability in present-day technology. Even though PCs do not exhibit the key quantum properties of phase-coherence, and many-body entanglement, correlated p-bits built out of scalable substrates have been shown applicable to training neural networ,ks solving combinatorial optimization problems with industrial relevance, performing fast probabilistic inference, simulating the ph,ysics of quantum systems, all of which are applications envisioned for near-term QCs. From a hardware, architecture and algorithms-l,ayers perspective, our ambitious goal in this project is to investigate whether PCs can outperform all known classical methods for p,ractical problems in combinatorial optimization and quantum simulation. To meet this ambitious goal, we outline three specific objec,tives:(1) Develop a complete hardware architecture for stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based PCs with physics-based models,, accounting for variations. Due to their dense integrability, CMOS compatibility and unique noise amplification, stochastic MTJs ar,e an ideal choice for nanodevice based PCs.(2) Develop architecture-hardware co-design techniques to drastically improve sampling ra,tes of scalable PCs, achieving ideal parallelism that increases linearly with system size.(3) Demonstrate and benchmark computationa,l advantages of PCs for practical combinatorial optimization and quantum simulation tasks using CMOS emulations of PCs and projectio,ns for MTJ-based PCs. This project builds on the rapidly developing field of domain-specific computation with for computationally ha,rd problems, leveraging emerging nanodevices and existing technology. Preliminary results based on small experimental prototypes and, emulations using CMOS technology suggest performance projections for scaled PCs with orders of magnitude improvements in energy eff,iciency and performance compared to classical computers. Key to these advantages are the room temperature operation, scalability of, magnetic nanodevices and feasible CMOS integration. Froman applied perspective, real world applications of scaled PCs include probl,ems critical for DoD, including logistics / vehicle routing problems, tactical communications and probabilistic decision making (in,ference) under uncertainty.

The proposed acquisition will operate as a user facility, with provisions to enhance access for other minority serving institutions (MSIs). Materials research at UCSB is highly inter-disciplinary, relying on user facilities in the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) and California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) that together provide NMR, electron and scanning probe microscopy, and x-ray characterization. Shared facilities are critical to research and development across the campus and the region, much of which is DoD supported.

The requested funds will be used to establish an optical characterization facility which includes UV, visible, and Raman spectroscopy and imaging of materials under static and dynamic conditions. Capabilities will include sample characterization from 10-900K, in situ study of catalysts under reaction conditions, and measurement of dynamics over timescales from picoseconds to hours.

Examples of such tasks range from informational gathering and surveillance, management of supply lines, establishment of communication and sensing networks, among many others. At the heart of any autonomous system is a collection of decision-making entities (or agents) that are preprogrammed to make independent decisions in response to locally available information. The success of a given control design hinges of whether or not these preprogrammed decision-making rules facilitate the emergence of a collective behavior that eciently accomplishes the task at hand. Developing competency in autonomous system designs for a diverse set of tasks could in theory provide a library of capabilities that a central commander could choose to employ as part of an overall mission plan.The goal of this proposal is to develop a foundational theory for how to successfully integrate autonomous systems into an overarching mission plan. Developing this theory requires a formal understanding of both (i) how to allocate a limited amount of autonomous assets to a series of dierent tasks and (ii) how to locally coordinate the behavior of the autonomous assets assigned to each task.

The project also seeks to explore and utilize the unique nonlinear optical properties of topological semimetals, such as shift currents, to optimize detector performance in unbiased operation. Ultimately, the proposed project seeks to demonstrate routes to broadband, tunable, ultrafast photodetectors that can operate at room temperature in the mid-to-long infrared IR spectral range.less","480,000",2022,2025
0,"Mechanism guided identification for the next class of high-strength, temperature-resistant refractory multi-principal element alloys",United States Department of the Navy,to Irene Beyerlein,"Developing the next generation of advanced turbine propulsion systems for far greater efficiency and powerdensity than todays superalloys highlights the long-standing challenge to design a material with highstrengthstability in high-temperature environments. With the advent of refractory multi-principal elementalloys (RMPEA), a promising solution had emerged. Since then, in search for suitable candidates, thedeformation mechanisms and yield strengths for a number of RMPEA compositions have been researchedand documented. Yet, to date, designing an ultra-strong RMPEA to resist high temperature degradationbased on simply thenumber, types, and ratios of elements constituting the RMPEA has not been performed.We initiate this project with the hypothesis that meeting this challenge lies in the fundamentalunderstanding of how dislocations move and the stress to move them at the scale of the glide plane. Thechallenges and opportunities in RMPEAs stem from both a)the flexibility in the choice of composition andprocessing parameters and b) the complexity in microstructures across multiple length scales. Especiallyunique to RMPEAs are the chemical and structural variations that fluctuate over the atomic and nanoscales.These length scales also span from those of the dislocation core to the length of the glide plane, suggestingthat such variations will profoundly affect basic dislocation processes. Numerous studies, utilizingnanomechanical testing, nanoscale characterization, or atomic-scale simulations, have provided evidenceof highly unusual, non-traditional dislocation motion (e.g., jerky glide, waviness) and pathways (e.g.,planar vs. wavy slip) in RMPEAs. However, the predictive capability that would link dislocation behaviorto slip strengths and ultimately to material str main goal is two-fold: a) build a data-driven computational tool capable of simulating minimumenergydislocation motion andpathways and calculating slip-plane constitutive responses in strainedRMPEAs and b) apply it to identify, in a high-throughput manner, RMPEA compositions for ultrahigh yieldstrengths stable over a broad range of temperatures, e.g., 1000 1600 C. We will target RMPEAs thatmeet the objective density and focus on composition variations in years 1 and 2 and the role of interstitialsand precipitates in years 3 and 4. Research activities will be driven to address four scientific questions:1. What are the unexpected dislocation behaviors in RMPEAs that lead to high temperaturestability?2. Is the effect of local chemical composition fluctuations in RMPEAs distinctive from thatof thermal fluctuations on dislocation motion?3. Can chemical compositions in RMPEAs affect the range of temperatures over which theeffects of local composition fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations?4. How does the response of a dislocation to interstitials and second phases change withtemperature and RMPEA composition?The technical approach builds on the phase field dislocation dynamics tool being developed by the PI. Theadvancements planned include introduction of thermallyactivated processes, experimentally informedshort-ranged order, and effects of interstitials and second phases, such as nanoprecipitates.

0,An Oxygen-resolved Proteomic Approach to Elucidate the Influence of Post-translational Modifications on Thermogenesis in Brown Adipocytes,United States Department of the Navy,to Brandon Greene,"The aim of this proposal is to acquire a system for the evaluation of the effect of various oxygen tensions on the human brown adipocyte proteome as it relates to non-shivering thermogenesis. The proposed system is composed of both a dedicated tissue culture facility capable of tissue culture from anoxia to hyperoxia, mitochondrial proteome sample preparation under a controlled atmosphere, and a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system for high resolution bottom-up proteomic analysis.-Body heat maintenance during extended cold exposure is critical to the safety and success of deep-water diving operations, and a diver#s intrinsic thermogenesis plays a role in combating heat loss. Recently, functional brown adipose tissue, capable of non-shivering thermogenesis by regulated mitochondrial membrane uncoupling by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), has been identified in adults, an organ previously unknown to be maintained into adulthood. Functional brown adipose tissue represents a potentially untapped intrinsic thermal regulation mechanism, yet little is known about the biochemistry of human brown adipose tissue.-Regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling via UCP1 has been proposed to involve reactive oxygen species in mice, which target UCP1 and post-translationally modify a matrix exposed cysteine conserved among mammals. This observation suggests that if similar post-translational modifications occur in human mitochondria, the oxygen concentration and pressure could have significant effects on thermogenesis, parameters that can vary dramatically across diving depths.-Two major questions remain unresolved: are cysteine post-translational modifications of UCP1 linked to functional outcomes that dictate thermogenic regulation, and how might these responses be distinct in the human and mouse UCP1? The proposed system, in concert with ongoing functional assay development work that motivates this proposal, will allow for a detailed analysis of post-translational modifications, both in vivo and in vitro, with sufficient resolution to identify and quantitate structural effects on functional outcomes of modified UCP1. This structure-function relationship will shed light on the regulatory function of reactive oxygen species in thermogenesis and provide a context from which to interpret thermogenesis under they hyperbaric conditions associated with deep-water diving.-The proposed system will be initially focused on identifying and rationalizing posttranslational modifications in brown adipose tissue, but the potential applications of the equipment are much broader, and will strengthen the research within the Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Research, and the University of California, Santa Barbara. By comparative analysis, we can examine proteomic changes during browning of white adipose tissue, the proteomic response to long-term cold/norepinephrine exposure, and the subsequent recovery. Beyond adipose tissue, the proposed equipment is suitable for alternative tissue culture studies where hypoxia or hyperoxia are of interest. Given this generality, we will develop an educational hands-on module for proteomic mass spectrometry through an upper-division undergraduate biochemistry lab course, to train the next generation of bioenergeticists in the most cutting-edge tools of the trade.less","463,184",2023,2024

The glycocalyx is a dense network of membrane-bound proteins and sugars that coats the mammalian cell plasma membrane. The building blocks of the glycocalyx have evolved to act as molecular ‘detectors’ facilitating communication between neighboring cells in a noisy environment and impact downstream physiological processes. Inspired by nature, we will leverage the understanding of interparticle bonding within this biological matrix to design smart materials functionalized with glycocalyx derivatives or synthetic analogues that can access a variety of microstructures and their emergent mechanooptical properties. Unlike conventional methods to chemically tune colloidal surfaces, we will modulate the composition and density of the glycocalyx-mimetic colloidal surfaces, allowing a large design space to control the kinetics and dynamical response of colloids to fluid flows and other external forces. Specifically, we will use bottom-up reconstitution to engineer shear-responsive colloidal coatings that will report, as an optical readout, the shear stress experienced by the applied material surface. Our long-term goal is to engineer thin-film colloidal coatings with superior optical and mechanical properties that will enhance the overall performance of material surfaces used in academia, government, and defense applications.less","456,435",2021,2024
0,Solution Processable Wide Band Gap Perovskites for Photodetectors,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Michael Chabinyc,"Detection of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) involving radiological materials is necessary in arbitrary locations and detection equipment may need to be deployed temporarily and quickly. Because WMDs can be transported by various means, e.g. cars, air, people, sensor networks that cover large areas are essential, but must not be cost prohibitive such that there is a question of deployment or not. A challenge is to devise novel sensor devices that can be produced at very low cost without sacrificing electronic performance. Radiological materials emit light at energies that is difficult to detect directly using common photosensors. To detect high energy radiation, e.g. gamma radiation or X-rays, materials call scintillators are used. Scintillators absorb convert high energy photons into many lower energy photons into the range detectable by many types of photosensors. Efficient detection requires high sensitivity photosensors due to the relatively low level of light emitted by WMDs. The research in this project aims to develop sensitive thin film photodetectors formed from semiconductors that can be dissolved in solvent and printed like inks. These materials can be then used to make high sensitivity photosensors that can detect blue to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of light that are compatible with scintillation layers. The materials systems under investigation in this work are based on organo-metal halide materials with perovskite and related structures. These are hybrid materials that have inorganic and organic constituents that can be made at very low cost using abundant elements. These materials also have high charge carrier mobility, which can lead to faster response and potentially high gain in photodiode and planar photoconductor structures. This project examines emerging organo-Pb materials and explores non-toxic organo-Bi materials that can absorb light in the blue to UV range. The interfaces of these materials with solution processable organic semiconductors will be studied to develop electrode layers that achieve high performance photodiodes with gain. The outcome of this work will be a disruptive advance in the ability to make high sensitivity, low-cost photodetectors.less","453,277",2015,2020
0,Exploring Entanglement in Quantum Spin Liquids with Nonlinear Spectroscopy,United States Air Force,to JOHN HARTER,"By harnessing the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, the development of transformative new computing technologies may be possible in the coming years. Many-body quantum states are extremely delicate, however, and environmental perturbations can easily induce decoherence in quantum systems. To solve this challenge, several exotic phases of condensed matter have been predicted to host excitations that are naturally immune to local perturbations. This project will investigate one of these classes of materials- the quantum spin liquids. Quantum spin liquids feature long-range entangled spin degrees of freedom that could be used for quantum information applications, but there are currently no good experimental techniques to quantify entanglement in solid-state systems. To address this deficiency, nonlinear spectroscopy will be developed as a tool to investigate the fundamental properties of quantum spin liquid materials. Two specific techniques will be employed- nonlinear optical rotational anisotropy, which will be used to study symmetries and symmetry-breaking phase transitions in these materials, and two dimensional terahertz spectroscopy, which will be used to uncover unambiguous signatures of fractionalization and entanglement, two hallmarks of quantum spin liquid ground states. In order to perform the nonlinear terahertz measurements, a new technique called near-field terahertz magnetic spectroscopy will be developed. Entanglement of many-body system touches upon a wide range of topics in condensed matter physics, and the potential applications of protected entanglement in solid-state systems are significant.

0,"Ligated Metal and Metal Oxide Clusters: Structures, Energetics and Reactivity",United States Air Force,to Michael Bowers,"Over the past two decades there has been an increasing interest in the generation and characterization of materials at the nanoscale. One of the principal drivers of these studies has been the fact that many of these new materials have unique and potentially transformative properties in the areas of catalysis, optoelectronics, coatings and many other areas. Of course another driver is to explore and understand these new systems at a fundamental level. We have been involved in nano-chemistry for many years both in the self-assembly of polymeric and biological macromolecules and in the generation, structure and reactivity of metal-based clusters. The current proposal focuses on metallic clusters of both coinage metals and transition metals. Our emphasis will be on ligation of metal clusters, building on our earlier work that showed measurement of sequential ligand binding energies and entropies is informative of bothinitial cluster structure and on ligand-driven structural transformations. In addition, we will use novel ion mobility-based mass spectrometric methods to measure ligated cluster cross sections and with the aid of modeling use these to directly determine cluster structures. Both of these kinds of measurements will be done on a newly designed and constructed instrument funded by a DURIP grant. In a new departure we will collaborate with Prof. Michael Duncan at the University of Georgia who is involved in generating macroscopic amounts of stabilized nanocluster systems. His current focus is on ligated metal oxide clusters.

This reduces the power needed for operations and also allows for superiorperformance of systems. This is especially important for portable and airborne electronic systems. Graphene-based electronics offers such an advantage. However, currently a major bottleneck is the lack of large-area, single crystal h-BN substrates for high-qualitygrowth of graphene thin films needed for scalable electronics.Maturation of h-BN growth will enable its use in wide bandgap heterostructures devices. Integration of h-BN into nitride-based devices can increase efficiency in solidstate lighting and power conversion. Boron nitride-based deep-UV light sources have the potential to be far more efficient than devices based on competing nitride materials. Deep-UV solid-state light sources can have extremely relevant applications in portable, efficient surface sterilization and water purification devices.

0,Towards Synthetic Nonabelions in Graphene Heterostructures,United States Department of the Army,to Andrea Young,"The goal of this proposal is to use graphene heterostructures as a platform for engineering nonabelian defect states, including Majorana and parafermion bound states. In the last decade, the possibility of using ground state topological degeneracy as a basis for quantum computation has gone from being a distant dream to an ambitious but reasonable possibility. Recent advances owe much to a shift in focus to a ÔsyntheticÕ approach. Rather than seek nonabelian anyons as elementary excitations in ÔnaturalÕ electronic systems, the disparate ingredients required are assembled through proximity effects. For example, Majorana bound states (MBSs)Ñthe simplest nonabelian defect stateÑcan be engineered by inducing superconductivity in an effectively spinless, one dimensional fermionic wire. As the experimental hunt for MBSs intensifies, the question arises as to whether richer parafermion and Fibonacci anyon ground states can be realized using the same synthetic approach. Theory answers this in the affirmative: although no-go theorems forbid parafermions in strictly 1D systems, coupled fractional quantum Hall (QH) edge modes can provide the necessary ingredients to engineer effectively 1D systems hosting defect states with richer quantum statistics. Graphene heterostructures are an ideal system to pursue synthetic nonabelions, providing viable routes to realizing all of the requirements for engineering, detecting, and manipulating Majorana and parafermion bound states (MBSs and PBSs) at current levels of technology. Two major experimental challenges prevent the immediate realization of MBS and PBSs in graphene heterostructures: lack of a complete phase diagram of integer- and fractional-quantum Hall states in bilayer (BL) and double layer (DL) systems most promising for engineering nonabelian defects, and insufficient understanding of the physics of QH interfaces, the tailoring of which forms the basis for all synthetic parafermion proposals. Our approach is to Classify the electronic phases of graphene double layers using a novel thermodynamic technique (year 1-2); Control superconducting proximity effects (year 1), interlayer tunneling (year 1-2), and symmetry breaking in helical edge state (year 1), using MBS detection as a benchmark (year 2); Combine these results to enable parafermion detection in graphene bilayers and double layers (year 3). Parafermion bound states are an important milestone towards fully protected topological quantum computation. PBSs allow two out of the necessary three elementary gate operations in a quantum bit to be fully protected from decoherenceÑMBSs, in contrast, only protect one. Furthermore, we expect that the increased experimental control over ground states and interfaces in graphene heterostructures will also contribute to more concrete proposals to realize Fibonacci anyons, the minimally dense anyon required for universal fault tolerant quantum computation where arbitrary unitary transformations of a qbit can be effected, immune from all local sources of decoherence.less","450,000",2016,2019
0,Situational Awareness Through Walls With Everyday RF Signals,United States Department of the Navy,to Yasamin Mostofi,"Situational awareness through walls is an important enabling capability for many applications. Assessing the situation through walls, however, is a considerably challenging and unsolved problem. In this research work, we propose a new foundation that can enable, for the first time, everyday Radio Frequency (RF) signals, such as WiFi, to build a complete situational awarenessthrough walls. Our approach is multi-disciplinary spanning wireless ommunications, robotics, and vision. More specifically, our proposed foundation has four underlying components. First, we propose a new methodology to translate the vast already-available vision data, e.g., several videos that arefreely available, to the RF domain. This enables us to instantly create a very large RF dataset, encompassing many different situations, for the purpose of analysis, training, and design, something that would have been infeasible if it had to be manually collected. Second, we propose a multi-dimensional signal processing pipeline, spanning time, frequency, and space domains, in conjunction with machine learning, in order to characterize and extract keyfeatures/signatures from the RF data pertaining to different situations. The number and location of the transmitting and receiving antennas can play a key role in the performance of RF-based situational awareness. In the third objective, we thus propose to use unmanned vehicles to emulate a large number of RF transmitter/receiver positions and enable the correspondingantenna position optimization via proper path planning. Finally, we run several experiments to validate the proposed foundation and understand its fundamental capabilities and limitations as a function of the given resources and complexity of the task. To the best of our knowledge, there is little work in the literature that has focused on enabling complete situational awareness in thismanner. Situational awareness is central to many applications as it is key to disaster relief, search and rescue, surveillance, and security missions. In particular, the ability to establish a situation through walls can be a considerably useful asset. The goal of the proposed work is to enable complete situational awareness through walls, which can significantly impact the aforementionedapplications. Furthermore, by bringing a foundational understanding to the capabilities and limitations of RF-based situational awareness, this work can provide a clear guideline for designing an RF-based system that can achieve the needed level of performance. This work further proposes to use unmanned vehicles to optimize the performance of RF-based situational awareness via proper path planning, thus making it immediately applicable to human-robotnetworks. Overall, this research effort can enable the successful deployment of a completethrough-wall situational awareness system, which can impact many applications.less","450,000",2020,2023

Although phased-array metasurfaces have revolutionized our ability to design and produce passive optical elements, it is currently an open question whether phased array light-emitting metasurfaces are indeed possible to construct. The unifying outcome of thisproposal is demonstrations of novel GaN-based luminescent metasurfaces where light is efficiently emitted into modes with imprinted metasurface functionality such as directionality or focusing.Research efforts are divided into four themes addressing challenges specific to 1) design, growth, and fabrication; 2) measurement; 3) theory; and 4) materials properties and engineering.In theme 1 investigations we will design and fabricate new photoluminescent and electroluminescent metasurfaces that significantly improve the efficiency with which light couples to desired metasurface-mediated emission channels. We will demonstrate luminescent metasurfaces with highly directional emission as well as luminescent metasurface lenses where light is directly emitted into focused beams. Metasurface measurements primarily exploit the PI~s unique homebuilt momentum-resolved spectrometer system, which quantitatively maps light emission as a function of the direction of emission. We will expand the spectral and angular range of our measurement capabilities, account for all the light emitted by luminescent metasurfaces, and quantify metasurface directivity as well as internal and external quantum efficiencies. Accurately simulating luminescent metasurfaces is challenging due to the lack of intrinsic phase coherence. We will pursue two approaches for developing experiment-validatednumerical simulations of metasurface photoluminescence. We will use combined experimenttheory feedback to establish intuition and heuristics for luminescent metasurface design. In materials-focused efforts we will definitively quantify how nanofabrication impacts internal quantum efficiencies and exploit quantum engineering of dipole orientations in UV quantum wells to achieve even greater control over metasurface-mediated light emission.

Existing technologies capable of few-photon processing utilize integrated photonics to reduce computational overhead, but they rely on low-efficiency, off-chip optical sources and detectors that limit scalability and stability. Similar to the revolutionary advancements in classical computing enabled by integrated circuits, the realization of optical quantum computing requires interfacing all components onto a single chip, which imposes conceptual and practical challenges. The goal of this research is to address these challenges by developing an all-electrical, all-on-chip quantum photonic platform capable of implementing the basic logic gates necessary for universal quantum computation. This is achieved through the fabrication and metrology of III-V/silicon photonic circuits that combine state-of-the-art, electrically driven quantum dot (QD) single-photon sources, silicon-based photonics for LO operations, and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.

Typical metasurfaces manipulate an external light source as it transmits through or reflects from the metasur,face. Designing metasurfaces in this common regime is straightforward, with well-established procedures. If the light source is plac,ed within the metasurface, however, the effects of the metasurface patterning are not easy to predict or understand. Recently, with, ONR support, we demonstrated first-ever examples of phased-array light-emitting metasurfaces. In this novel class of metasurface, l,ight is simultaneously generated and redirected within arrays of nanopatterned pillar structures. However, fundamental understanding, of the optical physics underpinning light-emitting metasurfaces is still lacking.

In particular, within W-band, at 94 GHz, up to 8 W/mm of output power density has been obtained which represents a 4x improvement over traditional gallium-polar (Gapolar)devices at similar frequencies while maintaining a high power-added efficiency in excess of 27%. These observed performance benefits of N-polar GaN arise from device design advantages associated with the inverted polarization-induced electric fields relative to a Ga-polar GaN-based transistor. For millimeter-wave devices, the addition of a GaN cap layer in the device access regions provides the dual advantage of increased access region conductivity with control over dispersion. In addition to the inverted polarization electric fields which provides advantages in device design, the N-polar orientation also offers a second difference in characteristics in that the N-polar surface is more chemically reactive than Ga-polar GaN. This difference between the two orientations creates the possibility for different device fabrication approaches for N-polar GaN relative to gallium polar GaN. To date, for the fabrication of these N-polar transistors, techniques and processes which were initially developed for Ga-polar devices have generally been applied to N-polar device fabrication with minimal optimization for the N-polar orientation.

0,Integrated Mechanism-Based Framework to Address the CMAS Problem in Gas Turbine Technology,United States Department of the Navy,to Carlos Levi,"ABSTRACT: A research program is proposed to generate the fundamental understanding and quantitative description of the mechanisms that govern deleterious CMAS interactions with oxides of interest in thermal and environmental barrier coatings (T/EBCs), and their implications in durability. The problem is sufficiently complex, owing in part to the stochastic nature of CMAS deposits andlimited relevant information on the properties and behavior of deposits and coating materials, that identification of robust solutions requires a strategy guided by ICME principles. Development of an integrated framework was initiated under a previous grant and the proposed project is intended to continue building its requisite components. It is envisaged that such approach wouldinvolve elements of (i) understanding the composition space of relevant siliceous deposits, (ii) phase equilibria and thermochemistry, (iii) the dynamic processes controlling the infiltration of molten silicates into porous TBC microstructures, and the reaction with dense EBC coatings, (iv) the mechanics governing the response of the system to cyclic thermal gradients, and (v) the processing science needed to implement the emerging engineered materials solutions. The proposed program would address the dynamics of the micro-, meso- and macro-scale processes during CMAS-coating interactions, focusing on the thermochemistry and melt dynamics. An ongoing activity on understanding quantitatively the kinetics of oxide dissolution and itseffects on melt crystallization will be extended to new materials and CMAS compositions. Of particular interest is the interplay between the flow of the silicate melt, not only into TBC segmentations, but also under aerodynamic flows on the overlying melt. The role of melt composition, already proven to be critical in both TBCs and EBCs, will continue to be investigated underthis project, with deposit compositions selected to (i) represent the relevant range of viscosities over the temperatures of interest, (ii) provide a spectrum of intrinsic melting and crystallization behaviors, and (iii) yield insight on the selection of phases resulting from interactions with the T/EBC oxide. The effect of oxide composition will be explored in the context of the MaterialsGenome Tool being developed under Navy project N00014-17-C-2034 (with QuesTek and UMN). Collaborations with other processing groups will also be pursued to explore strategies to enhance T/EBC properties via microstructure, notably the toughness of the coating. The thermo-mechanical response of CMAS-modified systems will be investigated using a unique laser-based gradient test facility developed at UCSB, in combination with computationalmodels developed under Navy project N00014-17-1-2351 (Begley). Research in this area will (i) identify the role of the thermal gradient on the penetration rate over a relevant spectrum of melt viscosities, (ii) ascertain the mechanisms arresting melt penetration, and (iii) determine the conditionsleading to transitions between different delamination modes, and the parameters that lead to minimization of damage for a given coating system and depth of penetration. The program builds upon previous ONR-sponsored work and UCSB facilities that enable the study of CMAS/TBC interactions using a variety of techniques, as well as interactions with other organizations that are addressing different components of the ICME framework. The expectedbenefit to the US Navy is an augmented science base and tools that would enable the development of improved coating materials and life prediction models. Broader benefits include an enhanced scientific foundation for high temperature materials and contributions to the training and diversity of human resources in this important area.less","450,000",2019,2022
0,Correlations in Topological Heterostructures,United States Air Force,to SUSANNE STEMMER,"In the past 15 years, topological matter has become a major focus of materials physics, resulting in an avalanche of new materials discoveries, such as three-dimensional topological insulators and semimetals. These materials host new phenomena that are generating enormous excitement for new electronic, photonic, spintronic and quantum device applications. Even richer physics is expected when topology acts in concert with strong electron correlations. Electron-electron interactions are, however, weak in most topological and Dirac materials studied to date, due to the vanishing density of states at the point-like nodes. In contrast, flat electronic bands, which are non-dispersive electronic states, have a much higher density of states, and promote strong correlations. The objective of this project to use thin films and heterostructures of known topological materials to controllably engineer such flat band states. Our approach builds on recent progress in epitaxial heterostructures of topological semimetals, such as cadmium arsenide. One approach that will be the focus of this project involves stacking of Dirac nodes that brought into proximity in multilayers. A second approach to flat bands involves non-uniform strain fields, such as those caused by dislocation arrays that form at interfaces between epitaxial layers with different lattice parameters. The periodically varying strain field acts as a pseudomagnetic field, which produces electronic states with a flat energy dispersion. The anticipated outcomes of the project are increased tunability and controllability of topological states of matter and new quantum phases and functionalities that benefit from topological protection.less","450,000",2021,2024
0,(YIP) EFFECT OF EXTREME ELECTRIC FIELDS ON THERMAL TRANSPORT IN WIDE-GAP SEMICONDUCTORS,United States Air Force,to BOLIN LIAO,"Wide bandgap semiconductors, such as GaN, Ga2O3, SiC, hold great promise for nextgeneration power electronic applications. A main limitation, however, is the requirement of efficient heat dissipation from these high-power devices. In particular, the active regions in power electronic devices with the highest temperature during operation are the same areas that withstand the highest electric field, up to extremely levels as high as 5 MV-cm. Therefore, how the extremely electric field impacts the thermal transport properties of these materials is of crucial importance for efficient thermal management and electro-thermal codesign of future devices. Surprisingly, little previous studies have focused on this important issue and it remains unclear which factors are the major contributors to the field-dependent thermal transport in wide-gap semiconductors. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to bridge this fundamental knowledge gap in materials science with a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Theoretically, we will apply state-of-the-art first-principles phonon simulations incorporating finite electric fields using the modern theory of polarization. In particular, we will investigate how the bonding nature of the wide-gap semiconductors is affected by the applied extremely electric fields, and how the crystal symmetry can be changed by the applied fields and in turn affect phonon scattering. Experimentally, we will incorporate the extreme external electric fields into laser-based thermal transport characterization techniques including time-domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) and transient thermal grating (TTG) to systematically examine the anisotropic effect regarding the crystallographic direction and the applied electric field directions. The expected outcomes of the proposed research will not only revolutionize our fundamental understanding of coupled charge and heat transport in wide-gap semiconductors, but also provide important design guidelines for optimizing thermal design of future power electronic devices based on wide-gap semiconductors.less","450,000",2022,2025
0,Thermogenic Capacity and Redox Regulation of Uncoupling Protein 1 in Non-shivering Thermogenesis,United States Department of the Navy,to Brandon Greene,"Deep-water diving exposes divers to cold environments with high thermal conductivity, placing divers at risk of performance impairment and mortal endangerment. Extrinsic mechanisms for thermal insulation are essential in combatting body heat loss, but intrinsic thermogenesis is also necessary for body temperature maintenance. Recent discoveries have revealed that brown adipose tissue, capableof non-shivering thermogenesis, is maintained in adulthood and presents a potential solution to heat loss during diving. Non-shivering thermogenesis involves partial mitochondrial membrane uncoupling by short circuiting oxidative phosphorylation, regulated and facilitated by an integral membrane transporter, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). While the environmental factors that determine adult brown adipose tissue development and maintenance remain unknown, the utility of this tissue depends on its thermogenic capacity. This proposal seeks to evaluate the thermogenic capacity of UCP1 within brown adipocytes. This will be accomplished through a strategic technical approach pursuant to three objectives. Our first objective is to measure the proton flux through human UCP1 under physiological membrane potentials to define the thermogenic capacity of individual UCP1 proteins. Our approach involves the construction of a protein fusion construct, where the vectoral proton conductance of UCP1 is aligned antiparallel to bacteriorhodopsin, a light-stimulated proton pump. Reconstitution of this construct into mitochondrial-mimetic unilamellar lipid vesicles allows for light-controlledpH gradients to be rapidly and continuously generated. An attached pH sensor based on yellow-fluorescent protein provides a rapid pH readout to directly measure proton conductance, thus establishing the maximal thermogenic capacity of an individual UCP1. Under physiological conditions UCP1 is necessarily regulated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and free fatty acid levels, through mechanisms that remain unclear.Objective two is to elucidate how free fatty acids and ATP regulate UCP1 activity. To this end, isothermal titration calorimetry and proton conductance measurements will be performed to elucidate the specificity, affinity, and mechanism of regulation of UCP1. These studies will develop a molecular level understanding of UCP1 regulation, informing rational regulation for on-demand thermogenesis. Evidence from murine model studies suggest that reactive oxygen species may be important in regulating UCP1 function through post-translational modification of a specific cysteine residue on the matrix face. This is particularly relevant given the hyperbaric oxygen levels necessary to maintain diver air supply and counterpressure. The human variant, conspicuously, contains a second cysteine predicted to be exposed on the mitochondrial matrix, and thus may render murine model studies problematic. Objectng the effect of these modifications on conductance and regulation. In parallel, the effect of oxygen tension on both murine and human brown adipocyte UCP1 expression and thermogenesis will be evaluated These studies will represent the first evaluation of hyperbaric oxygen concentrations on thermogenesis function both in vivo and in vitro.It is anticipated that the results of the above studies will provide rigorous benchmarks for UCP1 thermogenic capacity and regulatory status under various metabolic conditions, includthose specific to deep-water diving. With the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue quantified at both the single protein and cellular level, the potential role of this tissues in improving thermogenesis can be critically appraised.less","450,000",2021,2024
0,"Situational Awareness, Scene Understanding, and Context Inference With Everyday RF Signals",United States Department of the Navy,to Yasamin Mostofi,"Situational awareness, scene understanding, and context inference through occlusions is an important enabling capability for many applications. Assessing the situation through walls, however, is a considerably challenging and unsolved problem. In this research work, we propose a new foundation that can enable everyday Radio Frequency (RF) signals, such as WiFi, to build a complete scene understanding and context inference through walls. Our approach is multi-disciplinary spanning wireless communications, vision, and signal processing.More specifically, our proposed foundation has four underlying components. In Objective 1, we propose a completely different way of representing and imaging the scene, by exploiting edge interactions with the incoming waves, using Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) and the corresponding Keller cones. This enables capturing the scene in a compressive yet informative manner, thus addressing the high dimensionality of the RF-based imaging problem of interest. In Objective 2, we propose a methodology for generating a large synthetic RF dataset pertaining to many different scenes, objects, and activities, using available vision datasets, and further infer meaningful statistical metrics on the spatial dependencies of the scenes, to be used in conjunction with our proposed compressive RF imaging pipeline. In Objective 3, we extensively study the synthetic RF dataset that we shall generate under Objective 2, and mathematically characterize a key set of features that are relevant to each scenario. To achieve this, we utilize a combination of full frequency-domain high-energy epoch analysis and short-time transient analysis, in conjunction with the proposed compressive edge representation methodology of Objective 1. This analysis also allows us to train deep-learning pipelines that are generalizable. We further propose to exploit the interesting relationship that exists between the context of a scene and the location of the person in the scene, via utilizing our past work on tracking and localization. Finally, in Objective 4, we run several experiments to validate the proposed foundation and understand its fundamental capabilities and limitations as a function of the given resources and complexity of the scene.Situational awareness is central to many applications as it is key to disaster relief, search and rescue, and security. In particular, the ability to establish a situation through walls can be a considerably useful asset. The goal of the proposed work is to enable complete situational awareness through walls, which can significantly impact the aforementioned applications. Furthermore, by bringing a foundational understanding to the capabilities and limitations of RF-based situational awareness, this work can provide a clear guideline for designing an RF-based system that can achieve the needed level of performance. It will also have significant implications for smart homes/buildings, and personalized services.

Previous studies indicate that such networks (ÒCrossNetsÓ), performing analog processing of information, may eventually far overcome both their biological prototypes (cortical circuits) and digital artificial neural networks in both density and speed, at manageable power dissipation. Our project will address the key challenges on the way toward practical, large-scale, high-performance CrossNet spatial-temporal memories, in the following areas: 1. General STM theory. We are going to use both approximate analytical approaches and numerical modeling to establish the quantitative relation between the capacity, fidelity, and noise immunity of spiking, CrossNet-based spatial-temporal memories, with two types of pattern recording: ex-situ (using a software precursor) and in-situ (using synaptic spiking-timedependent plasticity Ð STDP). 2. Memristor-specific theory. Based on experimentally characterized properties of the new generation of crossbar-integrated bi-oxide (Al2O3/TiO2-x) memristive devices being fabricated by our Santa Barbara group, we will determine optimal ways to implement the STM in CrossNets using such crossbars. 3.

The system requested consists of a streak camera with InP/InGaAs photocathode, spectrometer, charge-coupled device video camera for the streak readout, and timing electronics unit. Additional funding is requested for optical and optomechanical components and fabrication services to integrate the new instrument with existing spectroscopic instrumentation at UCSB Optical Characterization Facility (OCF). The streak camera is capable of high-sensitivity time resolved detection of NIR light in the range 950-1700 nm which is relevant for characterization and development of novel low-bandgap materials used in panchromatic photovoltaic devices (solar cells), NIR light detectors, organic electronics components, and other areas of DoD interest.

0,Enhancing electro-optic coupling in novel ferroelectrics for quantum transduction,United States Department of the Army,to Christian Van de Walle,"Identifying materials with strong nonlinear optical properties is of paramount importance for many applications, and has recently become particularly relevant in the context of quantum information science. We will study the nonlinear optical properties of novel ferroelectric and incipient ferroelectrics based on heterostructural alloys that display emergent behavior. Our first thrust in the project is focused on carrying out a comprehensive first-principles evaluation of the nonlinear optical properties of AlScN. ScN occurs in the rocksalt structure, but when modest amounts of Sc are added to AlN, the resulting AlScN alloy retains the wurtzite structure and displays enhanced piezoelectricity and even ferroelectricity. The presence of incipient ferroelectricity in the alloys is strongly connected to enhanced nonlinear optical behavior, which we will study with state-of-theart first-principles calculations. In addition to providing quantitative results, we aim to generate insights into the mechanisms that yield the enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Our second thrust is aimed at identifying additional promising materials with superior nonlinear optical properties. One set of materials will be III-nitride alloys similar to AlScN but with other group-III elements, such as B or Y, substituting on the cation site. A second set of materials will be the II-IV-nitrides. II-IV-nitrides with transition metals on the group-IV site look highly promising from the perspective of incipient ferroelectricity and enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Identifying materials with enhanced nonlinear response that can be directly integrated into cavity electro-optics systems will allow for major advances in integrated photonic transduction, and particularly quantum transduction. Disruptive advances in nonlinear optical properties could also prove transformational for many other applications, including lasers and sensors. The phenomena that we aim to investigate are examples of emergent behavior in heterostructural alloys. The materials of interest involve mixing two compounds that have incommensurate crystal structures. Such heterostructural alloys typically exhibit a phase transition and large nonlinearities around a critical composition. The ferroelectric and nonlinear optical properties that will be investigated provide a compelling example, but the project will put us in an excellent position to examine other emergent phenomena as well as promising materials combinations.

However, a major challenge for structural materials is the strong dependence of the intrinsic plasticdeformation processes on material structure, with important features at the nanoscale, microscale and mm-scale in most classes of metallic materials. Slip processes under monotonic and cyclic loading are typically highly heterogeneous, propagating through complex microstructure dominatednetworks, ultimately resulting in local cracking and failure. The predictive challenge is all the more difficult in structural titanium alloys since (i) deformation is a time-dependent dynamic process at ambient temperature, (ii) the alloys display complex microstructure features at both the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, (iii) multiple deformation mechanisms exist at roomtemperature, including deformation twinning, slip and grain boundary sliding and (iv) cyclic properties exhibit some undesirable and not well understood dependencies on loading waveform and microtexture..The overarching goals of this proposed research program are to (1) integrate and extend emerging experimental techniques that reveal the dynamics and 3D spatial evolution of the deformation processes that occur during monotonic and cyclic deformation of microtextured titanium, (2) use the experimental information to critically evaluate and further develop models for yielding and fatigue and (3) to make models and 3D data broadly available to the Navy and its suppliers for usein life prediction or for development of improved processing paths. Of particular interest are the dynamics of the deformation processes that contribute to premature dwell fatigue failures in microtextured titanium alloys and the discovery and acquisition of the representative microstructural volume elements relevant to the cyclic loading process. At the mesoscale (~m to mm) protocols for acquisition, segmentation and analysis of 3D TriBeam datasets of model andcommercial titanium alloys will be developed. These datasets will provide new insights on the microstructural networks that enhance local deformation and will complement dynamic topotomographic synchrotron-based experiments at the same scale. At finer lengthscales (nm to ~m), new Heaviside digital image correlation (H-DIC) approaches will be deployed to acquire high spatial resolution quantitative measurements of deformation processes at the scale individual phases and grains.

This work will also address the related question of effective boundary conditions that will make possible advances in multiscale modeling through coupling between molecular dynamics simulations and continuum-level dynamics. The main challenge when considering parallel computing is to design algorithms that maximize the amount of computation local to each processor, while minimizing communication. The first important task is therefore to effectively partition the computational grid, i.e. to evenly distribute the entire grid among the available processors to ensure a balanced workload. This will be done through orderings to map 2D and 3D arrays of cells into a linear ordering, and through development of local octree data structures with which to discretize differential operators in such a manner as to closely or exactly match leaves to local computational cells. Another effort will be pursued to construct unconditionally stable methods that can take large time steps.

0,Shimware: Security Retrofitting of Monolithic Embedded Firmware,United States Department of the Navy,to Christopher Kruegel,"Shimware: Security Retrofitting of Monolithic Embedded FirmwareThe Navy uses a wide variety of systems that operate on embedded devices, and their security has direct implications for operations both in cyberspace and in the real world. Unfortunately, the enticing set of targets has not gone unnoticed by attackers and reports on vulnerabilities in embedded systems have increased dramatically over the last few years. In addition, even when bugs are found and reported, that does not guarantee that a fix will be available or can easily be deployed. The reason is that many embedded systems and IoT devices lack mechanisms that enable easy and safe updating and patching. In this project, we will develop novel techniques to automatically retrofit security into firmware that drives critical systems. To this end, binary firmware images are modified to mitigate a design or implementation flaw. While the actual content of a fix is very dependent on the details of the flaw being patched, this work will focus on the act of patching a monolithic firmware image, and automating as many aspects as possible. Our efforts directly address needs outlined in the BAA under focus area (11) Cyberspace Operations. By automatically removing vulnerabilities in critical systems, work in this project wo;; prevent compromise of devices and harden them against attacks.less","398,140",2020,2021

0,Sparsity-based Design for Robust Deep Learning - Topic C. iii (3),United States Department of the Army,to Upamanyu Madhow,"Deep neural networks represent the state of the art in machine learning in a growing number of fields, including vision, speech and narura1 language processing. While the principles behind learning and inference using neural networks were established many decades ago, their spectacular success over the past decade is generally attributed to a quantum leap in the quantity of training data and the available computation, which allows rapid experimentation with a variety of architectures. The empirical success of such experiments has propelled industry to deploy such networks in a host of arenas, including safety-critical applications such as vehicular autonomy. In principle, such techniques have the potential for revolutionizing situational awareness and autonomy for the battlefield as well. However, important open questions regarding the robustness of deep networks must be answered before this potential can be realized. The proposed research is motivated by the recent discovery that deep neural networks can be easily fooled by tiny, carefully designed, adversarial perturbations. For example, such perturbations would be almost imperceptible to a human observer, but could cause a deep network for computer vision in a self-driving car, to not recognize a stop sign, for example. This phenomenon was pointed out in 2014, and has prompted a flurry of research in adversarial attack and defense in the machine learning community. However, most of this work is again purely empirical in its nature, providing no guarantees on robustness. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a theoretical framework that does provide such guarantees, and to demonstrate its efficacy experimentally. The technical approach in the proposed research is based on the notion of sparsity. The input to neural networks (e.g., an image) is high-dimensional, and small adversarial perturbations can add up to a large number when summed over a large number of dimensions. However, in order for learning and generalization to be possible, the information in the input must lie in a low-dimensional manifold, and hence must be sparse with respect to some basis. The impact of adversarial perturbations can therefore be attenuated by a sparsifying front end which projects the input onto such a basis. Another, complementary, approach to attenuating perturbations is to impose sparsity on the weights of the neural network, as well as the activations of the neurons. The proposed research builds on preliminary results on theoretical guarantees and initial experiments based on such approaches. Topics to be investigated include design of improved, data-adaptive bases for sparsifying front ends, design of networks with sparse weights and activations, and exploration of universal sparsifying front ends. In addition to the primary goal of robustness, a secondary goal is to leverage sparsity as a means of enhancing the interpretability of deep networks, which are currently used in black box fashion.less","375,000",2019,2021
0,Advanced Ransomware Modeling for Threat Intelligence Extraction,United States Department of the Navy,to Christopher Kruegel,"Combating ransomware is essential to protecting the national infrastructure, mission-critical services, and theeconomic well-being of the nation. Both industry and academia have developed various approaches to combating malware. However, the ever-changing nature of these threats makes it difficult to identify patterns that correctly identify threats without false positives. Even if one would have reliable models for ransomware, the actual kill chain would make it challenging to identify an attack, as the deployment and activation of the ransomware is usually the last step in a highly targeted, multi-phase attack that includes an initial breach, lateral movement, and eventually the downloading of the ransomware binary. If these steps are not completed, the final ransomware component is not deployed, preventing the security analysts from extracting key threat intelligence about the attackers.We propose to develop a novel approach to create a simulated complex network environment to provideinputs to the various steps of the kill chain of a targeted ransomware attack, so that the attacker is deceivedinto delivering the final ransomware component, allowing for the collection of threat intelligence that aids inthe disruption of the malicious actor#s activity.While there are sandboxing solutions that provide a realistic execution environment for the analysis ofmalware, the multi-step nature of the kill chain, combined with the targeted nature of the attack, only allowsfor the detection of the early stages of a breach. Once the initial malware component (usually a downloaderor a remote access tool) is unable to move laterally or discovers a target network configuration that does notmeet the attacker#s expectations, the attack stops.To solve this problem, we propose a novel analysis framework that evolves the concept of a traditionalsandbox to an elastic sandbox that extends and adapts in reaction to the attempts to move laterally performedduring the early stages of an attack. Therefore, as an attacker looks for additional hosts to compromise,additional instances of the sandbox are deployed to support the advance of the kill chain. In addition, wepropose a machine-learning-based approach to providing network information that is both realistic whilenot disclosing important information to the attacker. In particular, we plan to use Generative AdversarialNetworks (GANs) to provide metadata about the network. Therefore, we plan to use real-world traffic fromthe target networkin order to train a GAN-based system. Then, during the analysis of a multi-step attack inan elastic sandbox, whenever data about the network needs to be fed to the malware samples the GAN-basedsystem is used to generate data that is consistent with (but differentfrom) the targeted network.By using this approach, it is possible to provide a more comprehensive analysis environment that automaticallyexpands as the attacker attempts to move laterally while providing meta-information about thenetwork configuration that matches the attacker#s expectation in highly targeted attacks.The resulting threat intelligence can be extremely effective in protecting computer networks from similarattacks and in disrupting the threat actor#s operations. For example, full visibility into the TTPs adoptedin the kill chain allows for the creation of models to detect both single artifacts (e.g., a specific credential harvesting component) and multi-step attacks (e.g., specific chains of tools). In addition, by obtainingthe final ransomware sample it is possible to collect command-and-control indicators, identify the ransomcollection infrastructure (e.g., the onion site used to interact with the victim), and possibly extract the cryptowallets involved.less","374,725",2023,2024

0,A Switch Controlling Biomolecular Reconfigurability,United States Department of the Army,to Daniel Morse,"The dynamically adaptive tunability of color and brightness of light reflected from cells in the squid's epithelium exceeds the present capabilities of our best reconfigurable synthetic materials. The PI and his students recently discovered the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing this tunability, revealing the workings of a remarkable protein-based molecular machine that drives this biophotonic tunability. In biophysical terms, the protein-based machine drives an osmotic motor that simultaneously regulates the refractive index and lattice dimensions of a Bragg diffraction grating. Professor Morse's group discovered that neurotransmitter-induced phosphorylation of the reflectin proteins acts by charge-neutralization of the proteins to trigger structural condensation, which consequently leads to the emergence of previously cryptic, stereospecific Velcro-like hydrophobic domains that subsequently drive condensation and hierarchical assembly, thereby driving the increase in refractive index and dehydration of the membrane-bounded compa1tments of the Bragg lamellae containing the reflectins to activate reflectance and progressively tune its color (1-8), but the specific nature of the neutralization-activated switch remains unknown. We aim through a combination of novel genomic, computational, genetic engineering and advanced imaging (including both single molecule cryo-TEM tomography and advanced CD spectroscopy, in concert with dynamic light scattering and other experimental analyses, to identify the molecular elements of this switch and its detailed mechanism of action, and in the final year of our proposed effort, demonstrate that it can be harnessed to make non-tunable proteins tunably switchable.

0,Understanding the role of surface structures on flow boiling instability,United States Department of the Navy,to Yangying Zhu,"Approved for Public Release)The increasing power densities in gallium nitride and gallium oxide power electronics, RF devices and la,sers are demanding aggressive thermal management solutions to dissipate high heat fluxes with stable performance. Two-phase flow boi,ling in micro and mini channels has been proposed as an attractive approach to address this problem due to the high latent heat of v,aporization and compact form factor. However, a critical issue associated with flow boiling is dynamic flow instability which result,s in sustained oscillations in flow rate, pressure drop and temperature. Extensive theoretical and experimental research has shown t,hat flow instability results from the interaction and feedback between internal characteristics (pressure drop vs flow rate inside t,he two-phase channel) and external (flow loop) characteristics. Different instability modes include Ledinegg instability, pressure-d,rop oscillations and density-wave oscillations, which correspond to different external characteristics. Recently, micro/nanoscale su,rface structures have been integrated into flow boiling micro channels. Enhancements in the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) as well, as critical heat flux (CHF) have been reported. Although the preliminary results are promising, most studies have not investigated, these surface-structure coated channels in different flow loops, and how surface structures affect each mode of flow instability ha,s not been studied. The goal of this proposal is to understand the influence of surface structures on different modes of flow boili,ng instabilities (Ledinegg, density-wave and pressure-drop oscillations). The study will bridge local mechanisms that occur on surfa,ce structures within channels to system-level instabilities that result from the interactions and feedbacks between individual chann,el and flow-loop components. The main tasks of this proposals are:Task 1: We will characterize the internal characteristics (pressur,edrop vs flow rate) curves for channels with surface structures in various flow loop configurations leading to Ledinegg, density-wav,e and pressure-drop instabilities, respectively. The internal characteristics of structured surface channels will be compared to smo,oth surface channels, and flow instabilities for these surface structure and loop combinations will be analyzed. Task 2: We will inv,estigate the role of surface structures on heat transfer characteristics within the channels under different flow instability modes.,Using a high-speed infrared camera, we will map the local wall temperature distribution and transient response on the surface struct,ures and correlate them with inlet mass flux oscillations.Task 3: Based on the hydrodynamic and thermal measurements in Tasks 1 and2,, we will extend classical models on flow boiling instabilities to include the effect of surface structures, and generate a regime m,ap to identify the optimal working conditions with the most heat transfer enhancement and suppressed instability.This study will gen,erate a more comprehensive understanding of the role of surface structures in different flow boiling systems, which will guide the d,evelopment of advanced two-phase thermal management systems highly relevant to DoD applications.as an educational institution, UCSB, performs fundamental and unclassified research.

0,Imaging Non-equilibrium Hot Carrier Dynamics in 2D Materials and Their Heterostructures with Scanning Ultrafast Electron Microscopy - Novel Functional Materials,United States Department of the Army,to Bolin Liao,"This proposed research is aimed at directly visualizing and quantitatively analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of photo-excited hot carriers in two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures using scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) and accompanying multiscale ab initio transport simulations. 2D materials and their heterostructures hold great promise as the core units of next-generation optoelectronic devices. In particular, the reduced electron-phonon scattering phase space due to the reduced dimensionality and the atomic thickness of 2D materials indicate a great potential of extracting and utilizing the photo-excited hot carriers for energy harvesting and photo-sensing applications. To fully capture the dynamics of hot carriers in 2D materials immediately after photo-excitation, extreme spatial (nanometer) and temporal (femtosecond) resolutions are required at the same time, beyond the capability of conventional ultrafast optical spectroscopic methods due to the optical diffraction limit. SUEM is a newly developed photon-pump-electron-probe technique that combines nanometer spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution for in situ and real-time imaging of photo-induced carrier dynamics, utilizing ultrafast-laser-induced photo-emission of pulsed electron beams. We propose to use SUEM to directly visualize the dynamics of hot carriers photo-excited in uniform 2D materials or right at the heterojunctions formed by 2D materials, with the following scientific objectives: l) understand the superdiffusive behavior of hot carriers immediately after photo-excitation caused by the initial high electronic temperature and reduced charge-lattice coupling in uniform 2D materials, which is expected to be fundamentally different from near-equilibrium carrier dynamics; 2) understand the charge separation, oscillation and recombination behaviors of hot carriers excited right at heterojunctions formed by 2D materials with different thicknesses, defined by electrostatic gates or fabricated by ""stitching"" different 2D materials, which will form the knowledge base for designing 2D-material-based photovoltaic cells and photo-sensors; 3) understand how hot carrier dynamics in 2D materials is modified by the interaction with various substrates, especially the roles played by polar optical phonons in polar substrates and the Schottkey junction formed with metallic substrates, which will provide both practical guidelines for device fabrication and new means to tailor hot carrier dynamics for specific applications; 4) as an exploratory direction, we will develop a time-resolved electron backscattering diffraction (tr-EBSD) mode in SUEM to directly probe the interaction between photo-excited hot carriers and specific phonon modes in 2D materials, in particular the out-of-plane flexural phonon modes; 5) to obtain quantitative understandings of these scientific objectives, a nonequilibrium-Boltzmann-equation-based simulation framework will be developed in parallel to quantitatively interpret experimental measurements, with inputs of electron-electron, electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering rates from state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. The proposed research will significantly advance our knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of photo-excited hot carriers, which has been extremely challenging to study due to the required spatial-temporal resolution and the lack of simulation tools based on first-principles. An accurate and detailed understanding of photo-excited hot carrier dynamics, which can be drastically different from near-equilibrium dynamics, is essential for developing next-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials and their heterostructures.less","359,698",2019,2021

0,Probing Nonequilibrium Phonon-Magnon Coupling in Emerging Functional Materials with Femtosecond Transient Thermal and Spin Grating Spectroscopy,United States Department of the Army,to Bolin Liao,"We propose the development of a state-of-the-art transient grating spectroscopy setup that can flexibly generate periodic thermal and spin excitations with sub-picosecond time resolution and diffraction-limited spatial resolution. The key strength of this system is that it can selectively excite phonons (quantized lattice vibrations) or magnons (quantized spin waves) with specific wavelength and monitor the interaction between the excited population and other energy carriers in the same material with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolutions. Phonons are major heat carriers and magnons are responsible for transporting magnetization in magnetic solids. The interaction between phonons and magnons is the origin of many technologically relevant processes, such as magnetoelasticity, magnetocaloric effect, spin Seebeck effect and the dissipation processes in spintronic devices. Cooling and energy conversion technologies based on magnetocaloric and magnetoelastic effect and next-generation communication and computing technologies based on spintronics are an important part of the DoD portfolio and can have important applications relevant to defense and national security. In particular, interaction of phonons and magnons when they are driven away from their local equilibrium is the key to understanding energy and information transport processes in these applications. However, current understanding of nonequilibrium phonon-magnon coupling is largely qualitative due to the lack of suitable experimental probes, which has hindered further development of materials and devices with desirable efficiency. We propose to develop an ultrafast optical spectroscopy system with the unique capability of separately exciting phonons or magnons with controlled wavelength and monitoring their subsequent evolution with high spatial-temporal resolution. This system uses two crossed laser beams with controlled polarizations: parallel polarization generates a periodic intensity grating, which can thermally couple to phonons in the sample whereas orthogonal polarization generates a periodic circular polarization grating, which can couple to magnons in the same sample. The two modes can be conveniently switched using a half waveplate. This system will also include a cryogen-free low temperature testing system, which will allow the investigation of phononmagnon interaction in novel magnetic phases, for example the skyrmion phase in chiral magnets. We plan to apply this state-of-the-art system to study 1) the influence of the microstructures on phonon-magnon coupling in functional intermetallic compounds such as half-heusler/heusler solid solutions, which are important magnetocaloric and magnetoelastic materials, 2) the coupling of flexural phonons and magnons in two-dimensional magnets, such as CrI3 and 3) coupled lattice and magnetization dynamics in skyrmion phases in chiral magnets. This requested equipment will be of critical importance in understanding the processes of heat and spin interconversion in emerging functional materials and in designing future compact, integrated cooling, energy conversion and communication technologies.

0,Active Disruption of Marine Cement-Coating Interface Interactions to Prevent Fouling.,United States Department of the Navy,to Rachel Segalman,"We propose to design polymer coatings with tailored sequence-controlled chemical functionalities for non-toxic surfaces that are soft- and hard-fouler resistant and have fouling release properties. We hypothesize that in addition to their amphiphilic character, good antifouling properties come from the incorporation of adhesion disruptors. Our prior results indicate that, for example, in the case of barnacles and other hard foulers addition of antioxidants interfere with the chemistry of barnacle attachment by forming weak adhesive-coating interfaces. In addition, some foulers create pH excursions during settlement and we hypothesize that pH buffers could inhibit the fouling behavior in such species. We will therefore produce coatings with sequence-controlled chemical functionalities that include adhesive disruptors in addition to amphiphilic segments. In addition, while we have developed chemistries with success at lab scale assays, we will begin to translate these into large scale samples suitable for marine testing.Our goals therefore are to:~ Synthesize amphiphilic block copolymers as anti-fouling/fouling resistant coatings~ Explore and understand a broad range of active adhesion disruptors including the stableradical TEMPO~ Incorporate adhesion disruptors into sequence defined peptoids and optimize their positionon the polypeptoid chain to ensure strong surface activity~ Provide coated samples on 4~x8~ glass plaques for large scale testing of our most favorable coatings, by developing new, effective methods for substrate coating production~ Develop new surface characterization tools to directly monitor surface properties in a wetenvironment (AP-XPS, super-resolution microscopy)~ Carry out laboratory scale assays including in-situ colorimetric experiments for radicaldetection and pH evaluation to relate surface coating changes with fouling resistance andfouling release behavior (U. linza, N. incerta, barnacle settlement and pushoff)We will therefore create Surface Active Block Copolymer (SABC) coatings functionalized withsequence controlled and modular means of introducing multiple surface-active chemicalfunctionalities. Specifically, sequence-controlled polypeptoids will be grafted to a siloxane-basedand PEO/AGE-based triblock copolymer scaffold for optimal fouling release. Our goal is toultimately develop a multi-purpose platform active against both hard and soft foulers and to dothis we will reproduce our sequence-controlled segments in radical polymers introduced into thecoating. To produce large scale coatings, we will explore three methods including attachment ofsequence-controlled segments before coating, after coating or grown from a coating surface.Additionally, we will investigate a unique combination of methods for hydrated surfacecharacterization including environmental XPS (available at the Advanced Light Source).

0,A PLUG-AND-PLAY QUANTUM PHOTONIC COMPUTING TESTBED,United States Air Force,to Galan Moody,"Optics and photonics are at the forefront of quantum information technologies, as they naturally link computing, communications, and networking in the same physical framework. In a similar way that integrated circuits revolutionized electronics, integrated photonics is a driving technology for scalable quantum information systems—from chip-scale processors and memories to encrypted key distribution and sensing across global networks. In this DURIP proposal, we propose to build unique instrumentation to test and benchmark integrated quantum photonic systems for (1) all-on-chip linear optical quantum computing with up to 16 quantum bits, (2) quantum machine learning with reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits, and (3) quantum photonic transmitter and receiver chips with entangled-photon source arrays for communications and networking. Despite the intellectually diverse goals of these applications, photonic integrated circuits are a common key enabling technology that calls for development of new instrumentation and measurement techniques. The University of California, Santa Barbara has a long-standing tradition of excellence in photonics with a world-renowned electronics and photonics group, a state-of-the-art nanofabrication facility and characterization instrumentation, serving as the West Coast Headquarters of AIM Photonics, and strong student engagement through the Photonics Society, which was recently awarded Most Innovative Chapter by IEEE. We look to build upon this success by constructing the first cryogenic plug-and-play quantum photonic computing testbed system capable of screening and benchmarking intermediate-scale (5-20 quantum bits) processors and circuits. With a recently awarded AFOSR Young Investigator Grant, we will develop novel heterogeneous photonics platforms with 100’s to 1,000’s of opto-electronic components monolithically integrated into a compact chip, including quantum light sources, filters, wavelength demultiplexers, tunable interferometers, and single-photon detectors. The range of applications that are enabled by intermediate-scale quantum photonic circuits is extraordinarily diverse. This DURIP proposal motivates and outlines the development of unique and innovative cryogenic photonic computing instrumentation that greatly expands the capabilities of existing tools to access leading quantum photonic systems with wider optical bandwidth and multi-channel optical and electrical connections at temperatures down to 0.8 K. This new tool will have vastly improved throughput, enabling cryogenic control of quantum photonic processors with up to 16 qubits and 32 integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. These unique capabilities will address critical testing needs for a wide-range of photonic devices with technological relevance to the Department of Defense. The proposed instrumentation will benefit the training of a large number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at UCSB in quantum photonics and information processing, which will be the focus of many Ph.D. dissertations.

Intellectual property (IP) reuse is essential to meet the challenges of IC design productivity improvement, design quality, and shorten the time-to-market. IP reuse has been explored for many years since the emerging of SOC design methodologies. It has been an efficient way to reduce the design cost for high-volume digital SOC designs. 2.5D integration is to integrate multiple IC dies on a same package with interposer technology, while 3D integration is to integrate multiple IC dies on a same package with more advanced stacked chip technologies, such as through-silicon-via (TSV) technology or monolithic 3D technology where multiple active device layers are grown on the same silicon substrates.The major goal of combining IP reuse and heterogeneous integration is to lower the design and fabrication cost, and accelerate the technology adoption. The advantages of any performance/power benefits of an emerging technology ultimately have to be translated into cost savings when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, it is very important to perform cost analysis at the early design stage to explore various design options, such as 2D SOC integration or 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integrations. The proposed project will build upon the PIÕs prior expertise and experience on 2.5D/3D architecture and design methodologies, and explore possible directions to enable an effective IP reuse strategy for heterogeneous integration. The proposed project consists of two tasks that address the challenges. The first task focuses on cost analysis and cost-driven IP reuse methodology exploration. The work will develop a set of cost analysis tools that can be integrate into traditional design automation flow, in order to facilitate design space explorations and help architects understand which approaches should be adopted. A cost-driven design methodology, which is the close coupling between cost analysis and 2.5D/3D architecture-physical design co optimization, will also be developed. The second task will develop two interconnect architectures that can help enable IP-reuse strategy. The first one is an interposer-based Interconnect Service Layer (ISL) architecture. The second one is a TSV-based ISL architecture. The design will be simulated with architecture simulation platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed work.less","299,989",2015,

Cytometry techniques combine illumination (typically by laser or light sources of different wavelengths) and detectors for imaging or counting to enable the identification, characterization and sorting of cells, e.g., by cell contents using fluorescent reporter dyes or cell size using optical properties. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) flows suspended populations of cells past a laser to excite fluorescent emission of a label then past a series of detectors to rapidly count and isolate subpopulations into distinct samples. This FACS instrument will enable urgent research needs and significantly expand quantitative biological measurement capabilities at UCSB relative to currently funded and potential DoD initiatives.

0,"A Switch Controlling Biomolecular Reconfiguration: ""Tunably Controlled, Calibrated Assembly""",United States Department of the Army,to Daniel Morse,"In our current ARO-supported research, we discovered the mechanism by which chargeneutralization precisely regulates the size of assembly of the reflectin protein, and how this assembly governs the osmotically tunable color and brightness of light reflected from intracellular Bragg reflectors in specialized cells in squid skin (1-17). Most recently we discovered that (a) this charge-regulated assembly of reflectin proceeds through a liquid nano-droplet phase, and (b) it is likely that the physics of this liquid state governs the size of the assemblies, and thus, the precise calibration between the excitatory neuronal signal and the output color. We call this process and its underlying mechanism ÒTunably Controlled, Calibrated Assembly.Ó We first discovered that reflectin's assembly is triggered (as many neuronally and hormonally activated processes are) by the neurotransmitter-activated, signal transduction cascade-mediated phosphorylation of the protein, which we realized serves to neutralize the Coulombic repulsion of the positively charged, initially disordered protein. Based on this finding, we then developed several ""surrogates"" for this neutralizing phosphorylation that we can use conveniently to progressively and reversibly drive charge neutralization and thus fine-tune the assembly of the purified recombinant protein in vitro; these include pH-titration, genetic engineering, ionic charge screening, and low voltage (< 1V) electrochemical bias. Based on these discoveries, we now propose to extend our research to other proteins, both to determine the extent of generality of the mechanisms we have discovered, and to enable us to harness and control the form and properties of other proteins that do not normally assemble, This proposal requests a 1-year continuation of our current project, to serve as a bridge to extend our latest discoveries to a suitable second protein, both to test and extend our conclusions made with the tunable reflectin from squids, and then to use this second protein as a tunably controlled, calibrated assembly- directing carrier for other proteins. As the first candidate we propose to explore the use of amylin, a small (37- amino acid) protein that offers several advantages for our proposed study: like reflectin, amylin is cationic, initially disordered, and capable of assembling via extended beta structure stacking. As a fall-back if our efforts with amylin do not succeed, we propose to genetically modify the initially non-tunable reflectin from octopus, converting it to one that can be harnessed as carrier for the precisely calibrated, finely tunable assembly of other non-assembling proteins. If we are successful in our proposed identification of the structural modifications and conditions necessary to precisely and predictively control the size and extent of amylin (or octopus reflectin) assembly and its reversibility, follow-on work beyond this one-year bridging effort will then aim to develop the engineered protein as a robust platform for bringing non-assembling proteins under finely tunable, controlled assembly, enabling us to harness their functions in fiber, thin-film or other physical forms useful for Army applications.less","250,000",2020,2021

Wepropose here a high throughput testbed that will allow us to rapidly quantify the performance of thesetraps. The fabrication of these micro-3D ion traps is based on two photon lithography, a new additive 3Dprinting technology. The resulting traps will combine the tight confinement of 3D traps with a scalableproduction process, where 100s of electrodes and multiple traps can be incorporated on a single chip.Trapped ions have demonstrated the best performance in key quantum computing metrics, but as withall quantum systems, scaling up to a practical quantum computer has been challenging. We are proposinga cryogenic ion trapping system to significantly speed up the testing cycle from over a month to less thana day. The bottleneck for fast testing is achieving the ultralow vacuum pressures necessary for trappingions. In our testbed, a cryogenic pump freezes out gas molecules rapidly onto cold surfaces, only severaldegrees above absolute zero, obviating the need for long system preparation, and allowing us to test a trapdesign in a single day. The cryogenic environment also provides key benefits for quantum gate operation: itachieves lower pressures than what is possible with room temperature systems and it reduces decoherencedue to heating sources. These ancillary benefits combined with the next generation ion traps we are chargedwith producing position our groups to realize the best trapped ion performance in key quantum computingfigures of merit.Realizing a fast development cycle is important for testing new ion traps in this unexplored parameterspace. Our systems fast turnaround is matched by the trap manufacturing cycle, where multiple trapscan be made in under a day.

0,Multifunctional Metamaterial Laser Energy Control,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Jonathan Suen,"Oxford Defense North Carolina, LLC (ODNC) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will collaborate to develop a beam control metamaterial surface in this Phase I STTR effort. A concern with laser beamed energy systems is the inadvertent exposure of operators and bystanders to inadvertently scattered or reflected laser energy. In an energy web system, multiple transmitters and receivers will be mounted on mobile land and airborne platforms, thus unexpected vehicle dynamics may cause beam misalignment and exposure of personnel from energy by reflection from adjacent structures or glint. A solution may be to cover adjacent structures with an absorptive or scattering coating, i.e. black and white paint. However, this would present a large static visual signature, and could not protect canopies or windows. Instead, we propose the development of a conformal beam control metamaterial. Metamaterials are engineered sub-wavelength periodic structures with tailored electromagnetic properties. The metamaterial will scatter or absorb (as designed) laser energy in a narrow band while presenting a minimal visual and infrared signature at other wavelengths. Using metamaterial theory and techniques developed in academic research, the metamaterial will be able to sustain high laser intensities without damage, and will be able to be economically fabricated over large areas.

While our prior work has definitively shown the advantages of tailored sequence-controlled chemical functionalities for non-toxic surfaces resistant to soft-foulers, we hypothesize that the incorporation of adhesion disruptors is necessary to achieve hard fouling resistance. In the last cycle of funding, we demonstrated the utility of stable free radicles in disrupting the redox chemistry of cement formation and therefore reducing the adhesion of barnacles to surfaces. We now propose to produce coatings with sequence-controlled chemical functionalities that include adhesive disruptors (both anti-oxidants and pH control buffers) in addition to amphiphilic segments.

0,Cryogenic Optical Links for Digital Sensor Transmission and Readout with Energy Efficient Modulators,United States Department of the Army,to Aaron Maharry,"Digital sensor data received by infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPA) faces a readout bottleneck before exiting the cooled environment to room temperature processing. This is the very same bottleneck faced in other applications with harsh environments, such as quantum and classical supercomputing. Electrical links are lossy and bandwidth limited, and coaxial cables have a high thermal conductivity and electromagnetic interference as compared to optical fibers. For these reasons optical links have revolutionized data center communication, but further development is still required to adapt the same technologies to cryogenic temperatures. Datacenter silicon photonics rely upon thermal phase shifters to maintain proper biasing despite fabrication variance and drifting environmental conditions. Critically, any heat dissipation inside the cooled environment must be compensated by a 500X cooling overhead. Additionally, the thermo-optic coefficient in silicon is orders of magnitude lower at 77K as opposed to 300K. There are various monolithically-integrated control methods for silicon photonic modulators, but to be implemented at low temperatures, wide athermal tuning may be needed. A possible alternative may be electro absorption modulators (EAMs), which offer a compromise between the stability of MZMs and the compactness of RRMs. The strength and speed of modulation is insensitive to temperature, but the operation wavelength can shift by 100 nm from 300K to 77K. Furthermore, light is absorbed into photo-current, so low optical power is required to minimize heat dissipation. An efficient EAM may outperform thermal tuning-based modulators, but deliberate design decisions must be made for cryogenic operation. The scope of this Phase I effort is to identify candidate modulators capable of high-speed error-free operation at cryogenic temperatures, and to outline plans for fabrication in existing foundry offerings. In addition, full link analysis or power consumption, potential roadblocks to scale, and promise for monolithic integration will be explored.

0,Low Level Signal Detection for Passive Electro-Optical Space-based Surveillance,United States Department of the Air Force,to Matthew Buoni,"ABSTRACT: Toyon Research Corporation and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) are proposing development and feasibility demonstration of advanced algorithms for the detection of vibration signatures in scattered light. The algorithms are being developed for applications including space-based electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) sensing at high frame rates and extremely low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Toyon-UCSB are proposing both detailed modeling and simulation of the signals measured by the space-based EO/IR sensors, as well as implementation, demonstration, and evaluation of advanced noise reduction and detection algorithms. The proposed algorithms are based on principles from Track-before-Detect (TrbD), implemented via nonlinear particle filtering techniques, and are designed to near-optimally integrate information from high-frame-rate EO/IR sensors to provide improved effective SNRs at the detection stage, enabling high-confidence detection decisions, with reduced latency. In this novel application of particle filters for low level signal detection, the filter is designed to exploit the particular physical signature (temporal vibration) of the object of interest. Phase I R & D will include signal and sensor modeling, signal processing algorithm development and evaluation, and development of a recommended Phase II prototype architecture. BENEFIT: The successful completion of this R & D will ultimately result in advanced algorithms and a real-time software implementation for detection of extremely dim modulated signals from space-based EO/IR sensor platforms. Additional applications include airborne- and ground/surface-based sensing onboard manned and unmanned platforms. The proposed technology has the potential to enable detection of target signals which were previously not exploited due to the low level of the signals, due to signal scattering and/or long sensor-target standoff ranges. Thus, the proposal technology has applications in counter-terrorism, law enforcement, and a variety of civilian applications, in addition to many military applications.less","150,000",2013,2013

Preliminary analysis indicates that the system will achieve 10-cm z-axis (altitude) accuracy, thereby enabling autonomous carrier landing capability under GPS-denied conditions. Moreover, the system has a low probability of detection and intercept (LPD/LPI), significant built-in anti-jam, anti-spoof, and multipath-mitigation capabilities, and is not prone to integer ambiguity and the cycle-slip phenomenon that is common with GPS-based carrier-phase tracking systems. Furthermore, because the system makes use of the same hardware that is required for GPS processing, the LC-PALS receiver can be fully integrated with GPS, thereby minimizing redundant hardware and enabling simultaneous operation with GPS, when available. While an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is not required for precision approach and landing, an onboard IMU can be used as an additional and complementary measurement source for improved attitude performance. During the Phase I program the LC-PALS feasibility will be fully verified and a hardware design will be completed in preparation for a Phase II demonstration.less","150,000",2014,2015

Namely, the group III nitride alloys AlGaN, InGaN, and InAlN, show behavior that strongly deviates from that expected from an average alloy. In the case of simple GaN-AlGaN-GaN stuctures, the expected barrier behavior of AlGaN is not observed, rather the AlGaN barrier allow percolative transport. This behavior is is attributed to potential fluctuations from the combination of natural alloy fluctuations combined with fluctuating space charge from polarization fluctuations. In the proposed program, we will study the impact of natural alloy fluctuations on Schottky barrier behavior for AlGaN, InGaN and InAlN.

THz imaging can, potentially, be used for this application, but it requires the development of a new class of THz detectors whereby the signal to noise ratios are improved significantly.

In Phase I, we demonstrated an initial class of prototype devices that are consistent with such multiplicative mixers, and we documented the potential benefits of such devices as ca. 40 to 70 dBs. In Phase II, we will demonstrate such multiplicative mixing THz detectors, and also demonstrate the metrics associated with it’s use. At the end of the Phase II project, we will have mitigated all risk elements associated with the science, and will be in a position to initiate a commercialization effort.

The proposed approach utilizes a novel apparatus which is scalable to process volumes of hundreds of liters at modest cost.  The novel apparatus will be capable of accessing process pressures above 0.6 GPa (~6,000 atm or ~90,000 psi) and temperatures above 650 °C, conditions where growth rates of high quality single crystal gallium nitride above 15 microns per hour have been demonstrated using a non-scalable apparatus.  The key deliverables for the Phase I project include:  (1) Demonstrate capability of a novel high-pressure apparatus to contain ammonia pressures and temperatures greater than 0.6 GPa and 650 °C, respectively; and (2) Demonstrate growth of GaN crystals with a crystalline quality at least competitive with HVPE GaN, with a path to achievement of world-class crystal quality.

Bulk gallium nitride substrates, currently in use for laser diodes only and grown by a vapor-phase technique, are projected to grow from a market size of $144M in 2008 to $405M in 2010.  The proposed approach should enable a significantly lower substrate cost and enable key technologies of interest for the Air Force and DoD, including high performance detectors and emitters and high-performance high-frequency GaN-based electronics.  A low cost native GaN substrate would also transform the substantially larger commercial market for light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

Agents will be expected to perform a variety of cooperative missions such as persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), target search, acquisition, and tracking, area denial, attack, and battle damage assessment under dynamically-varying bandwidth limitations, intermittent communications, and limited information. Two key features of the proposed cooperative control system include (1) the use of an estimator-based distributed architecture allowing each UAV to internally model the actions of the others, and (2) the introduction of a communications index to scale the algorithms from centralized control to distributed control. The estimator-based distributed architecture models a centralized design by attempting to compute the control actions for each individual agent as a function of the agents' positions and the global information state (GIS). The communication index permits our control algorithms to transition from a completely centralized solution to a decentralized one based on the information rate available to each agent within the cooperative network. The performance of the system will be guaranteed to degrade gracefully with the level of information available to each agent. Toyon will implement the algorithms developed under this effort in its SLAMEMT simulation and will demonstrate their effectiveness under varying levels of information throughput.

To address mobility, we propose the use of quasi-orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBCs) that do not require channel state information (CSI) to be available at the transmitter. Additionally, our receiver design jointly performs channel estimation and detection.

The proposed project builds on our current research and involves the formation of patterned coatings from specifically synthesized polymer brushes as well as surface-active block copolymers (SABC) that can be assembled on test surfaces. The research proposed in this program will be focused, as a result of recent successful studies, on the preparation and testing of hydrophilic, hydrophobic and zwitterionic groups incorporated into “ambiguous surfaces” that are chemically patterned at various length scales. The advantage of this approach is that we can create fundamental understanding leading to new low cost coatings with molecular and higher level control of the fouling resistant (FR) surface to solve a major Navy problem. The goal of this research is thus to produce FR coatings and to understand why these coatings are effective for fouling release. In constructing these surfaces we will collaborate with the group of Rachel Segalman at UCSB. The coatings will be tested for their ability to provide specific surface properties. Surface analytical methods will include imaging X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and microscopy, and scanning force microscopy (SFM) as well as contact angle studies. We are initiating studies using neutron reflection to take advantage of the natural labeling that fluorination provides. In addition, studies of fouling settlement as well as fouling release in conjunction with ONR investigators such as J. Finley, A. Clare and D.

Routing of the UAVs is performed using cooperative control theory while management of the sensors onboard is accomplished through Toyon's existing optimization techniques. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using our software testbed SLAMEMT on an example problem. In Phase II, we would work to refine our algorithm, perform a physical demonstration of the system, and expand our focus to include the CSAT of sea-based targets in a littoral environment.less","100,000",2004,2005
0,High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Velocimetry Measurements for Microfluidic Devices,United States Department of the Air Force,to Carl Meinhart,"The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a commercially-viable micro/nano-PIV instrument that can measure fluid motion in microchannels with 100 nanometer out-of-plane spatial resolution, 1 micron in-plane spatial resolution, and 1 microsecond temporal resolution. The instrument will also be capable of measuring bulk fluid motion in 100 nanometer channels.The 100 nanometer out-of-plane resolution will be achieved by using an evanescent field to illuminate flow-tracing particles near a waveguide surface. The PIV instrument will be well-suited for investigating near-wall slip flow, boundary layer regions, and electro-osmotic flow in microfluidic devices. Although this form of micro-PIV has been reported by several researchers, it has not yet been commercialized. We will use low-cost laser diodes, and well-designed optical coupling strategies, to improve the evanescent illumination and to develop a low-cost commercial instrument.In order to take full advantage of evanescent wave illumination and to measure flows in 100 nanometer channels, the size of the flow-tracing particles must be reduced to order 20 - 50 nm. These particles must be small enough to flow within a ~100 nanometer channel or within an evanescent field, while being large enough to sufficiently dampen Brownian motion, and emit sufficient fluorescent light. We will investigate the use of single quantum dots (QDs) or clusters of QDs. QDs are well known for their broad excitation curves, and bright emission signals. Several research groups have suggested using quantum dots as seed particles but to date there has been no report in the the literature that this has been done.less","100,000",2004,2005

While the field of THz detectors has largely been driven by the needs of the astrophysics community, where cryocooling is considered acceptable, recently, two classes of room temperature THz detectors were demonstrated.   One of these is the tunable antenna coupled intersubband terahertz (TACIT) detector, which was demonstrated by a team from UCSB and JPL.  Specifically, the TACIT detector has already been demonstrated as providing a reasonable room temperature NEP at 1 THz, and it has been demonstrated as providing high speed of operation, and voltage tunability with a small dc bias.  In this proposal, the Tanner/JPL/UCSB team is proposing the refinement of the TACIT detector to the specifications required by the DoD.  At the end of Phase I, we will deliver a TACIT detector, along with a demonstration of the man-portability aspect via a demonstration at an Air Force facility.  At the end of Phase II, we will deliver an optimized TACIT detector with specifications as set forth by the Air Force POC, and various Air Force customers.

Agile calls this new invention the Switchable Trimmable Acoustic Resonator (STAR). An array of such filters could implement a very compact and reconfigurable high-selectivity filter bank. Similar, BST-based STAR filters could be combined to make a low-loss and high-selectivity duplexer or TR switch. There are many other possibilities for frequency-agile components including filters with selectable and flexible bandwidths. Thus the proposed technology will have a profound impact on the front-end filtering problem in modern communications. This project will investigate the full potential and limits of this technology, and result in the first demonstration of voltage-controlled or tunable STAR devices. The technology is enabled by perovskite oxides, specifically BST and SrTiO3. The quality of the devices is highly sensitive to film quality and orientation.

Agile’s high-frequency tunable filter development efforts using BST have found that loss due to surface or series resistance (Rs) is a significant limitation.

0,Signal Processing with Memristive Devices,United States Department of the Air Force,to Vladimir Kochergin,"To streamline data processing in, e.g., hyperspectral imaging, new massively parallel data processing circuits are needed. The team of MicroXact Inc. and UC Santa Barbara propose to develop circuits based on completely novel computing paradigm, which could be extremely efficient (i.e. dense, relatively inexpensive, and consume very little power) for massively parallel signal processing. We offer to (1) develop fully CMOS compatible hybrid circuits based on the conventional CMOS technology and recently suggested thin film memristive devices; (2) demonstrate analog dot-product computation, which is a core operation for all signal processing applications; and (3) perform rigorous and impartial comparison of their performance to that of flash based circuits.

We will further develop large scale hybrid architectures for signal processing and bio-inspired networks and perform their detailed simulations using models derived from experimental data. In Phase III we will commercialize the developed technology BENEFIT: According to the ITRS 2007 Roadmap, currently used CMOS technologies will reach the 18-nm technology node and 7-nm physical gate length by 2018. It is anticipated that beyond this point, CMOS scaling will likely become very difficult if not impossible due to power dissipation problem.

Our approach is to exploit a three terminal VCSEL structure where the third terminal modulates the optical gain by means of current steering while maintaining the lasing pump current constant. Maintaining the pump current constant during modulation eliminates conventional limits imposed on directly modulated VCSEL speeds and promises to achieve ultra-high speed VCSELs approaching the intrinsic bandwidth ~90 Ghz (fmax) of VCSELs or ~180Gbps. By using a third terminal, the requirements for efficient lasing can be in principle decoupled from requirements imposed by fast modulation (e.g. relaxing modal volume/RC time constant tradeoff). This will be a major breakthrough in the ability to cost effectively directly modulate lasers (even in 2-D arrays) at speeds that have hitherto been only possible by using expensive, bulky and lossy external modulators.

This will be a major breakthrough in the ability to cost effectively fabricate directly modulated lasers (even in 2-D arrays) with polarization diversity which has hitherto been only possible by using expensive, bulky and lossy external modulators. The basic principle that we propose relies on the fact that the polarization of a diode laser optical output can be influenced by the direction of the current flow. As opposed to the horizontal geometry of a waveguide diode laser, the vertical VCSEL geometry makes it possible to inject pump current in two orthogonal directions. Two electrode pairs can be placed orthogonally around the cavity and the resulting orthogonal current directions can overcome the built-in asymmetry given by birefringence to actively control the polarization of the emitted laser light. We believe that this new class of device will be critical for laser-detection-and-ranging (LADAR) applications, and will open up a whole new class of devices and applications which exploit high speed polarization modulation.less","98,924",2010,2010

0,THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF N00014-14-1-0633 Koopman Mode Decomposition and Mixing in Fluid Flows,United States Department of the Navy,to Igor Mezic,"Executive Summary Two recent developments are gaining in popularity in analysis of complex uid ows of Navy in- terest. These developments are 1) the Koopman Mode Decomposition and 2) Mesohyperbolicity analysis. Here we propose to couple these developments into a theory that is capable of describ- ing mixing in complex, aperiodic ows using a strongly reduced representation - the Koopman Mode Decomposition - that enables application of both classical (e.g. lobe dynamics) and novel mesohyperbolicy-based tools to the problem of mixing in aperiodic ows. Firstly, we propose to utilize Koopman Decomposition methods to address the problem of mix- ing in ocean ows. Ocean ows commonly exhibit periodic components due to daily and seasonal forcing e ects. Those forcing e ects cause both super harmonic and subharmonic response due to nonlinearity of the dynamics. We hypothesize that the attractor in this case is of skew-periodic type. In order to verify this hypothesis, we will study well-resolved ocean models. The decom- position in this consists of time-mean, quasi periodic part and continuous-spectrum part. Notice that the continuous-spectrum part can be modeled as a stochastic process. In our work we will characterize the stochastic nature of the continuous spectrum part and consider it after we have thoroughly explored the mixing properties of the deterministic part, consisting of the quasi-periodic mean. Time-periodic examples of the deterministic part are well-studied in 1 1/2 degree of freedom dynamical systems. Some studies exist in three-dimensional time periodic case as well. However, the quasi-periodic case was studied much less in two dimensions and not at all in three dimensions. We propose to develop a theory of mixing in aperiodic ows by considering separate Koopman Modes as distinct contributions to overall mixing dynamics. From chaotic advection studies we know much about what this theory would look like in two-dimensional examples. For example, for ows with simple, periodic time dependence we know that lobe dynamics plays a large role in description of mixing in this case. We propose to explore the relationship between mesohyperbolicity and lobe dynamics in this context. In numerical simulation of periodically oscillating double gyre ows we have already observed positive and negative mesohyperbolicity concentration within lobes. We will explore this connection mathematically, using the formal apparatus of lobe dynamics. In addition, we have shown that in KAM regions, mesohyperbolicity concepts are related to Green's residue criterion. We will explore this connection further, pursuing Green's criterion ability to detect invariant structures. This will enable a deeper understanding of mixing dynamics in such ows and enable extensions to quasi-periodic ows that we will address next. Mesohyperbolicity theory for quasi-periodic ows will be developed. Its connection with lobe dynamics will be established. Invariant structures will be studied by pursuing extension of ideas from Greene's residue criterion via mesohyperbolicity connection. Finally, ows with fully aperiodic time dependence will be studied. First the splitting of the ow into its mean, quasi-periodic and continuous spectrum components will be established. Then, the developed knowledge of mixing in quasi-periodic ows will be supplemented by additive contribution from continuous spectrum dynamics. This will enable a more complete understanding of mixing in aperiodic ows via a staged approach where the analytical di culties induced by time dependence are added in the natural order of complexity.

Mine detection programs such as the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) system and the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) currently use frequency-doubled 1-µm lasers as the laser source. The generation of green laser light via frequency doubling of a 1-µm laser has typical conversion efficiencies that are ~50% for the process. For unmanned vehicles or manned platforms with limited space and power, the loss in efficiency due to frequency doubling impacts size, weight, and power. It is highly desirable to develop a solid-state laser whose primary wavelength is in the green and does not require frequency doubling. Laser sources for naval mine detection require 1 - 5 ns pulses, pulse energies of greater than 100 mJ, and average powers of ~ 50W.

Integrated optics is the most suitable candidate to address those essential requirements because it allows large scalability for high data transfer rate and minimize the heat transfer with the external environment. At cryogenic temperatures, only lasers and photodetectors have been demonstrated to operate efficiently, while isolators, switches, and modulators must be redesigned to work at such operating condition.

Providing coverage requires 100s to 1000s of sensing devices. Command and control (C2) of such a large number of devices, to provide time sensitive targeting (TST), poses a difficult technical challenge. Our solution to this problem is to use a hierarchy of unattended ground sensors (UGS). Ultra low-cost trigger nodes provide indications that a possible event of interest is occurring in a local area. While only equipped with a limited sensor suite, they will still be able to fuse information from multiple co-located nodes to reduce false alarms. Trigger nodes will be responsible for tasking a much smaller number of video nodes at the next higher level of the sensor hierarchy. Once a video node is alerted by a field of trigger nodes it will task its image sensor in the direction of the event and begin relaying this imagery to a stand-off communications center. There is also the provision to utilize a local video tracker to further increase the autonomy of the hierarchical sensor network. We note that such a hierarchy dramatically reduces the C2 personnel requirements. Toyon has teamed with the University of California, Santa Barbara.BENEFITS: A key benefit of the proposed work is an effective means for managing 100s to 1000s of wireless sensors. While such problems have been addressed in the literature and experimental testbeds, their applicability to problems of interest to the military has been limited.

Because most of the effective stimuli-responsive molecules used as sensors, such as, spiropyrans, suffer from intrinsic limitations – poor solubility in a range of polymer systems, simultaneous activation by heat, light and mechanical stress, and low stability in the highly colored form – we seek to develop a stimuli-responsive system based on new thermo- and photochromic material recently developed in our laboratory, called donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA). To proceed in a rational manner, we propose to synthesize a range of DASAs and incorporate them into polymers. Based on the flexible synthetic design, each DASA adduct will be constructed to have different absorbance wavelengths and each yielding at different strains. This work will allow for facile visual mapping of stress throughout the polymer sample and should provide a better understanding of how polymeric systems behave under strain.

The power of mental re-appraisal can be dramatic: the toil of work can be converted into health promoting physical activity, a threat can be transformed into a challenge, fatigue can be circumvented, purpose in life can improve health and strong social relations can alter visceral organ function. Complementing this top down influence there are known brain health promoting physical activities including sleep, exercise, a sound diet and a healthy microbial flora. Together, this rapidly growing behavioral literature on mind-body interactions suggests a powerful two-way street, with information and influence flowing in either direction. The shaping of the body's visceral physiology by the brain has been defined mostly by the contribution of circulating pituitary-hypothalamic hormones or autonomic influences arising from the brain stem. While these canonical mechanisms clearly link the subcortical brain and body, the contribution of cognition and the cortical control of the body (beyond muscles) is glaringly absent from most physiology models. For example, there is new evidence establishing the links from cortex to the adrenal medulla. There is also extremely rapid sympathetic modulation of the heart and skeletal muscles occurs with decision making, motivated behavior and reward seeking. On slower time scales, mental states can alter normal organ function and might even alter the gut microbiome. We are only beginning to formalize the architecture that enables this multi-layered control occurring across multiple time scales and contexts. Complementing these top down processes, there are enormous gaps in understanding how information from the body reaches the brain to shape cognitive health and performance. Circulating factors released by muscle are widely recognized as drivers of brain health and the expression of BDNF. There is increasing recognition that the autonomic nervous system, particularly vagal afferents also play a critical role as a signaling pathway and can also increase BDNF expression in the brain. Nevertheless. there remain many gaps in understanding the neurally mediated mind-body nexus. It is also evident that the gut microbiome can shape brain activity, cognition and physical performance. In this case, the mechanisms by which signals from microbial flora are transduced and alter cortical activity via neurotransmitters and other means are only beginning to be understood. Recently the concept of the ""holobiome"" has been introduced to emphasize that no single aspect of an organism is sufficient to understand performance. With that, we are motivated to consider a multi-dimensional approach. Objectives: We propose a workshop that will focus on identifying both the known and uncertain bidirectional neural pathways, signaling mechanisms within the body and cortical circuits that mediate mind-body interactions. To focus discussion, the workshop will be organized around top down and bottom up processes and draw on expertise from both animal and human model systems. The primary objectives are: 1) Identify putative and probable mechanisms by which mental activity reaches and shapes the viscera through neural and non-neural mechanisms. 2) Discuss known and putative mechanisms of visceral perception and characterize pathways for propagating information to the neocortex of the brain. 3) Review the signaling mechanisms that allow the gut and mind to shape each other's activity. Define opportunities for translating animal studies of gut microbiome to neural based model. 4) Bridge the gap between behavioral models and targets of intervention. Identify challenges and opportunities in establishing biologic/mechanistic understanding of mind-body interactions that could enhance or sustain human performance.less","53,581",2020,2021
0,Research Area 11.1 ARO STIR Program: The Chaotic Quantum Oscillator,United States Department of the Army,to Bjorn Birnir,"We analyze the sequential resonant tunneling model of electron transport in weakly coupled, n-doped semiconductor superlattices under a DC voltage bias. From the Poincare map, we illustrate the bifurcations of the electronic dynamics as the bias voltage is smoothly varied. We also vary the number of periods making up the superlattice, as well as the strength of (time-independent) random perturbations in the widths of the wells and barriers and (time-dependent) noise in the bias voltage and tunneling rates. We find supercritical Hopf bifurcations, perioddoubling bifurcations, and period-doubling cascades, all of which are robust against the additional perturbations. These bifurcations have been predicted for single assymetric quantum wells at terahertz frequencies, but in superlattices, these bifurcations occur at gigahertz frequencies and are easier to measure.less","50,000",2016,2017

0,Electrode-Specific Molecular Wires for Bioelectrochemical Systems (Chemical Sciences),United States Department of the Army,to Guillermo Bazan,"Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEÕs) are molecules defined by a conjugated, semi-conducting backbone and pendant ionic functionalities which afford solubility in polar solvents Ð a feature which has allowed for the utilization of these molecules in biological systems. Through interactions with microbial membranes, certain classes of COEÕs have been shown to improve the performance of bioelectrochemical devices such as microbial fuel cells (MFCÕs). To this point, the use of COEÕs in microbial devices has been limited to the addition of solutions of the synthetic compounds to suspensions of cells. Instead of directly influencing the microbes, the aim of this study was to modify the anode of a MFC in order to enhance physical and electronic interactions at the biotic-abiotic interface. To achieve the electrode modification, a novel COE containing a terminal thiol was designed and synthesized. Formation of self-assembled monolayers through thiolate-gold bonds was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Increase physical interaction between bacterial cells and gold films as a result of surface modification was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Microbial fuel cells utilizing gold electrodes functionalized with this molecule showed a 27% increase in current generation and an 81% increase in peak power relative to bare gold electrodes.less","49,784",2015,2016

0,Understanding and Assessing Riparian Habitat Vulnerability to Drought-Prone Climate Regimes on Department of Defense Bases in the Southwestern USA,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Michael Singer,"This project will provide a toolkit and quantitative support for land/water conservation management plans to promote the sustainability and resilience of riparian forest ecosystems in arid and semi-arid landscapes. This work will focus on drought-prone ecosystems, where prolonged dry periods affect riparian habitat quantity and quality, thereby limiting their role as thermal and moisture refugia for many threatened and endangered (T&E) species including songbirds and amphibians. Drought stress affects the extent, functioning, and sustainability of riparian habitats for T&E species, which are of great management concern on Department of Defense (DoD) bases. However, there are currently limited tools available for developing sustainable, long-term riparian habitat management plans that are responsive to changes in the mean state and variability of climate. This project will detect and assess the responses of sensitive riparian forests to drought stress over recent decades, and will generalize these responses through modeling of a warming/drying climate punctuated by variable rainfall. The research will be carried out within three DoD bases in the Southwest, but will be widely applicable to other drought-prone lands, which is critical because the spatial extent and severity of drought is increasing across the USA.less",2018,‐,
0,"Combining Novel Analytical Tools, Long-Term Data, and Experiments to Manage Multi-Stressor Threats in California Amphibian Communities",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Cheryl Briggs,"California and the western United States are experiencing increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Such extreme weather events interact with other stressors – including invasive species and disease – to affect amphibians in ways that may be difficult to predict. Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate taxon on earth, and Department of Defense (DoD) installations in California represent essential refugia to many threatened and endangered amphibian species. Resource managers at DoD installations, who are challenged with managing these species in the face of multiple stressors, require knowledge, tools, and approaches to provide cost-effective stewardship of the natural resources and ecosystems on their lands. The objective of this project is to advance scientific understanding of, and develop management strategies for, the interacting effects of multiple stressors on threatened amphibian species in California. The focal stressors are (a) extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts, and floods, (b) infectious diseases, and (c) introduced species, but the project team will also obtain information on the effects of other stressors, including livestock grazing and (opportunistically) wildfires. This project focuses on two DoD-relevant threatened amphibian species, the California red-legged frog () and the California tiger salamander (), but the results and the tools developed here will also provide information on other DoD-relevant aquatic species, including the southwestern pond turtle () and the tidewater goby (), along with the western spadefoot toad ().less",2024,‐,
