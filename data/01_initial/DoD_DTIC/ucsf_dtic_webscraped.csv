0,Cell Aging and Metabolism in Combat-Related PTSD: Validation and Female Studies,United States Department of the Army,to Owen Wolkowitz,"Scientific Objective and Rationale: Identifying and characterizing biomarkers of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is critically important in basing diagnoses on biological criteria rather than only self-report and in developing targeted therapies for personalized and more effective treatments. Considerable progress has already been made under two recent principal DOD grants, which have identified several promising biomarkers of PTSD in combat-exposed males. These initial findings require validation in separate male cohorts as well as expansion to female populations with combat-related PTSD. Both of these studies are already recruiting subjects for other analyses, and blood samples will be available for the proposed work. The objective of the proposed research is to expand and validate putative biomarkers for PTSD that we have investigated under previous DOD grants. Methods: The investigators will perform plasma metabolomic assays on both male and female samples. They will determine mitochondrial DNA copy number and will assay mitochondrial function. They will use flow cytometery and other methods to identify and validate signatures of accelerated immune cell aging in post traumatic stress disorder. They will determine the level of inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome in post traumatic stress disorder samples. They will measure allopregnanolone and related neurosteroids. Contributions to Advancing the Field of PTSD Research: We aim to apply these assays and analyses to future larger, and in some cases, longitudinal cohorts as well as pre/post deployment and pre/post-intervention cohorts. Pre/post designs would be especially meaningful in assessing causality between these biomarkers and PTSD symptoms, potentially allowing us to develop better early diagnosis markers and novel therapeutic targets.less","1,399,842",2016,2021
0,Tools for Design and Engineering of Hybrid Nanostructures,United States Department of the Navy,to Shawn Douglas,"RESEARCH PROBLEM: Molecular engineering holds great promise to create novel bio-inspired materials and devices that will exceed the performance and sustainability of many existing military technologies.Preliminary research efforts have generally focused on adapting individual biopolymers found in living organisms and coaxing them to self-assemble in a customizable fashion. We now understand"" many of the subtleties of crafting simple shapes with these materials, as evidenced by the number and variety of nanostructures tha""""t have been produced in the past decade. To date, most shapes have been designed to fold from a single type of biopolymer, and only"" a handful of hybrid nanostructures have been created. The next challenge is to extend and generalize hybrid design methods to const""ruct more sophisticated molecular nanostructures that draw inspiration not only from Nature~s raw building materials, but also the d""ynamic formation of multi-polymer complexes. Overcoming this challenge is a crucial step toward realizing the goal of engineering biopolymers to create powerful new technologies that are completely unprecedented in nature.TECHNICAL APPROACHES: To create devices t""hat can perform useful work, we must learn to leverage natural machines that have evolved catalytic behavior. The scope of this proj""ect is to develop methods to integrate nucleic acid nanostructures with dynamic protein machines. Our project has three objectives:(1) -Extend our computer-aided design (CAD) tools to accommodate hybrid nanostructures made from combinations of nucleic acids and p""oteins in a unified graphical interface. (2) Design, synthesize, and characterize a set of molecular building blocks that can be use""""d to construct hybrid nanostructures of various sizes, shapes, and functions. (3) Build a proof-of-concept device that leverages DNA"" origami for structural patterning of protein modules capable of seeding the growth of microtubule filaments. Our technical approach"" for this 5-year project is to focus concurrently on objectives 1 and 2 during budget periods 1~5, culminating in publications and l""""imited beta software testing. We will mostly dedicate budget periods 3~6 to advanced application of our methods for objective 3, and"""" dissemination via additional publications and open-source software release. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMEOF THE RESEARCH, IF SUCCESSFUL: The"" proposed project will produce a series of peer-reviewed papers describing the research outcomes and methods developed. FUTURE NAVAL RELEVANCE: Macromolecules have tremendous potential for adaptation into military-relevant technologies such as high-performance mat""erials, environmental sensors, or artificial muscles.

0,TourniTek: Pre-Hospital Thermal Regulation For The Prolonged Field Care of Traumatic Injuries,United States Department of the Air Force,to Shahram Aarabi,"TourniTek and the University of California at San Francisco propose to design, build, and test a portable chiller for the prolonged field care of traumatic limb injuries. Using thermal regulation, injured limbs may be preserved in the field until patients can be transported to definitive surgical care. By treating these injuries prior to surgical care, amputation and disability can be prevented. This technology will improve the range of deployment and efficiency of air evacuation of warfighters. TourniTek can be applied to injuries due to asymmetric warfare, traditional warfare, traditional tourniquet use, and REBOA use.less","749,827",2022,2023
0,VascuSight: Wearable Machine-Learning Ultrasound Monitor,United States Department of the Air Force,to Shahram Aarabi,"TourniTek and the University of California at San Francisco propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using our novel 3D ultrasound technique with machine learning ultrasound image analysis to diagnose internal hemorrhage and guide blood product resuscitation in the field with our novel technology, VascuSight. Using artificial intelligence-based techniques, severe injuries and burns may be rapidly triaged and treated in the field until patients can be transported to definitive surgical care. By diagnosing and treating patients at the point of injury, disability and mortality will be reduced and precious blood products will be conserved. This technology may improve the range of deployment and efficiency of Aeromedical Evacuation. VascuSight will provide minimally invasive and accurate monitoring of resuscitation in the field, will be usable by soldiers and medics, and will be able to communicate remotely with advanced medical providers.less","74,263",2022,2023
