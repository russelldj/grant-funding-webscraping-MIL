This nanofabrication process could potentially reduce to a single step, the fabrication of photonic crystals by direct imprinting on inorganic materials. The method is low cost and suitable for large-scale areas. In Phase I, the demonstration of feasibility of the method provides the basis for fabricating a new class of quantum-dot nanolasers in Phase II. BENEFIT: Our approach will revolutionize the fabrication of nanophotonic components and will allow development of new photonic devices. The first targeted application will be a new class of quantum-dot nanolaser arrays. It will then be expanded into other areas of photonic applications, such as for displays. The method promises to enable the development of many other nanophotonic applications.less",

Sensitive, high-speed quench detection and control systems are required to ensure safe operation to allow superconducting systems to transition onto Navy platforms. The program aims to develop active acoustic emission quench detection and control systems for HTS magnets and other superconducting devices for naval applications. The Phase I program focuses on developing Navy-specific quench detection hardware and demonstrate their performance on small superconducting coils. The system should respond within 80 ms of the onset of a quench, even in the presence of noise and vibrations that may be present on a Navy ship.

Indium phosphide (InP) has proven itself as a radiation-hard cell material, and indium nitride (InN) has shown superior radiation resistance to 2MeV protons. InP (1.34 eV) and InN (0.7eV) bandgaps allow current-matching (38 mA/cm2) under the AM0 spectrum, enabling two-terminal operation. We will investigate use of a pseudomorphic InGaP window to boost InP top cell efficiency from its current 19% one-sun AM0 level to 22%. We describe a process that allows the InP top cell to be undisturbed by dislocations from the InN growth. The 0.7eV InN bottom cell has an upper efficiency limit of ~9% AM0; however, the growth of InN would introduce substantial dislocations, and its efficiency would likely be about 4%. However, the dislocations should not compromise the InN radiation hardness, and we believe that the proposed research should lead to tandem space cells with efficiencies of ~26% (1 sun AM0, 25C) which would be flat in power output to fluences beyond 1e16 1MeV electrons/cm2.less",

Discrimination can be achieved through selective filtering of the response inherent to the system design followed by post acquisition data processing. The parameters of the object are obtained by an inversion of the measurements to establish the principal EM moments of the detected object. These are never determined perfectly because of a fundamental non-uniqueness in the solutions (the response of the target) to the governing diffusion equation. Limitations introduced by depth of the target, the response of the ground, and the presence of other non-UXO metallic objects combine with constraints of weight and power considerations to restrict what is achievable. An optimum system is bounded by these theoretical and practical considerations and, in the end, represents a compromise that detects, discriminates, and classifies to an agreed upon specification.The project performed basic research to develop a systematic approach for the design and fabrication of an optimum active EM system based on the methodology employed in the minerals exploration industry in the search for metallic ore bodies. The intent of the optimum system, bounded by practical and theoretical limitations, is to detect, discriminate, and classify buried ordnance.less",

Furthermore, it is desirable to find and characterize a metallic object without the need to accurately locate the sensors at multiple positions around the target. The ideal system would thus locate and characterize the target from a single position of the sensor and indicate to the operator where to flag the target for subsequent study.

        "abstract": "Perchlorate contamination of ground and surface water has occurred at a number of sites, principally in the western United States. The contamination is a result of historical activities such as previously acceptable disposal procedures and the testing of solid rocket motors. The health effects of low exposure levels to perchlorate are not well known, but state action levels for perchlorate in drinking water are as low as 1 part per billion. The responsibility for perchlorate remediation at many of these sites falls to the Department of Defense, and the development of innovative remedial approaches has been an active area of research. The most widely used approach for perchlorate remediation is ion exchange using strong-base anion exchange resins and traditional pump-and-treat technology. One drawback is the relatively low perchlorate selectivity of commercial resins, which renders a large fraction of their anion exchange capacity unusable. Highly selective anion exchange resins have been prepared, but they are much more expensive. Bioremediation by perchlorate-reducing bacteria is an attractive approach for the in-situ degradation of perchlorate in groundwater; however, it is ineffective if other electron acceptors, especially oxygen and nitrate, are present.The primary research objective was to modify activated carbon by creating additional quaternary ammonium sites and measure the capacity and selectivity of these activated carbons for perchlorate adsorption. The secondary research objective was to determine whether granular modified activated carbon (GMAC) anion exchange materials could be prepared using only gaseous reagents under conditions similar to those used to prepare conventional gas-activated carbon.less",

        "abstract": "Permafrost environments are a unique setting for built infrastructure, an environment in which small thermal perturbations can have dramatic impacts on structural stability ranging from foundation settling to catastrophic failure of roads, bridges, and runways due to thermokarst generation. A substantial global temperature change is expected within the next century with a higher degree of variability predicted in arctic regions (approximately 4\u00b0C) where substantial Department of Defense (DoD) resources are currently located. The non-linear coupling of future changes in air temperature, surface insolation, and surface/subsurface hydrology to soil mechanics generates a high degree of uncertainty as to the environmental changes that built infrastructure will actually experience.The objective of this project is to develop and validate a fiber-optic geophysical sensing package capable of providing real-time information on subsurface conditions relevant to infrastructure performance and failure in permafrost environments. The system will consist of a combination of three fiber-based distributed sensing methods\u2014distributed temperature sensing (DTS), distributed strain sensing (DSS), and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)\u2014designed to be embedded in, or near, built infrastructure and to detect regions of progressive permafrost thaw induced by subsurface flow, surface water accumulation, or changes in system thermal behavior. Seismic noise generated by infrastructure utilization (e.g., planes, automobiles, and railway activity) will be measured by DAS and inverted to generate real-time shear modulus profiles across the length of the installed component. Pre-failure deformation will be measured using DSS, allowing characterization of the early phases of consolidation. These profiles will be coupled to DTS-detected thermal perturbations to identify zones likely to be experiencing thawing and to flag such regions for inspection before infrastructure failure occurs. The resulting information will be provided on a quasi-real time basis to system decision-makers for incorporation into maintenance planning.less",

For discrimination technologies to be validated they must be demonstrated at real sites with unexploded ordnance (UXO) and real world conditions. ESTCP has invested in munitions response demonstration and validation efforts to understand the applicability and limitations of these pilot technologies at live sites under the Live Site Program. ESTCP has also assembled an Advisory Group to address the regulatory, programmatic, and stakeholder acceptance issues associated with the implementation of discrimination in the munitions response process. The continued involvement of regulators within the demonstration process aids technology development and relevance for decision makers.The two primary demonstration objectives of this study were to (1) determine the discrimination capabilities of the Berkely UXO Discriminator (BUD) at San Luis Obispo (SLO), California, and (2) investigate, in cooperation with regulators and program managers, how discrimination technologies can be implemented in cleanup operations.less",
