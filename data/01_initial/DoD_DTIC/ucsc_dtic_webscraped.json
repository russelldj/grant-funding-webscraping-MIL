        "abstract": "Continuing advances in solid state storage technology have enabled detachable storage devices that are inexpensive, high bandwidth and high capacity, making them practical for sharing even large amounts of data among devices that need not be networked.  For this reason, they are very attractive as a mechanism for secure data storage as well as transfer. Unfortunately the current generation of memory sticks expose risks that make them unsuitable for use by US government agencies. The primary concern with these devices is the attack surface presented by the micro-controller that is required to present the storage as a USB peripheral to the host operating system. Exploits have been demonstrated in which an attacker could, with brief physical access to a memory stick, reprogram its firmware so as to enable arbitrary privilege escalation on a host operating system without needing to exploit an OS-level software vulnerability.  A reprogrammed storage device could exploit the USB protocol, which multiplexes many physical devices on logical channels and permits devices to negotiate registration (and re-registration), to masquerade as a keyboard for long enough to capture the root password via physical keystrokes.  The flash can be reprogrammed with a laptop, making tamper-resistant designs ineffective. We describe the first year of work designing and implementing a secure operating system for memory sticks that is correct-by-construction as well as amenable to formal verification.  Several key features of Twizzler make it ideally suited to the task. It structures memory---whether persistent or volatile---into coarse grained objects that are the units of access control, reducing both the number and variety of access policies that must be considered when deploying the OS. Comprising only 5K lines of code and exposing only 20 system calls to user-space, Twizzler exposes a minimal attack surface and is small enough to be a reasonable target for embedded architecture as well as for systematic verification. Moving the kernel out of the I/O path, it exposes the raw I/O latency and bandwidth  of the memory to programs. To transform Twizzler into an appropriate target for detachable storage micro-controllers requires a research and development effort along three distinct but interrelated lines: Guaranteeing via a flat permission model with no superuser role, in which cryptographically signed capabilities persistently encode access rights. Providing isolation of untrusted code both within and across threads of control via \\emph{security contexts} that subsume UNIX roles, and  gated APIs that subsume system calls and IPC, providing fine-grained control of privileges without escape hatches. Ensure secure boot and integrity of trusted components via unforgeable, content-derived naming.less",

The resulting infrastructure aims at becoming the core of hardware designers tools by allowing large scale designs, incremental elaboration/synthesis/simulation, leverage multicores, and cloud. We call this project LGraph for the Live Graph that resides at its core. LGraph is designed to become the next LLVM-like infrastructure for hardware design with a focus on fast response time for large designs. Current tools, commercial and academic, do not scale well with large designs. This lack of scalability is shown in compilation, simulation, and verification. As the designs scale in size, the tools get very long compilation times, long synthesis feedback loops, and even slower simulations. While software flows are used to fast incremental flows, hardware designers need to wait hours to get feedback. The goal of this project is that for synthesis and simulation a small code change even for a large project should complete in a few seconds. In addition, other time consuming tasks like formal verification or design frequency improvement should also finish in few seconds. The proposal includes details by providing incremetal elaboration, scalable synthesis, incremental simulation with Hot Reload, scalable simulation. All these changes while providing more correct by construction transformations with elastic pipelines and third party tools.

        "abstract": "Underwater noise, most notably from shipping, seismic activities and naval sonars, has emerged as one of the most important and controversial stressors on marine mammal populations worldwide. Despite geo-spatial and temporal evidence linking such anthropogenic disturbances to mass stranding events by deep-diving cetaceans, causal mechanisms between oceanic noise and lethal or sublethal injuries have been difficult to identify. Currently, the leading hypotheses suggest a combination of extreme behavioral flight responses, cardiovascular instability and decompression syndromes. However, the question remains, what factors differentiate when an escape response by cetaceans due to noise exposure leads to benign avoidance or to death? An understanding of two critical elements of the escape response, physiological resiliency and recovery, are required to answer this question. To date, neither has been studied for any integration of key behavioral (dive duration, exercise level), environmental (water temperature), physiological (heart rate, metabolic demand, respiratory rate, heat flow), and biochemical (pH, lactate, blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, catecholamines/cortisol) triggers that control the three Rs of escape reactions in mammalian divers - response, resilience and recovery. We will focus on four physiological pathways to assess resiliency and recovery via the cardiovascular system, 1) thermal and metabolic homeostasis, 2) metabolite control, 3) neurological protection, and 4) behavioral-respiratory integration. This will be accomplished by pairing our current physiological and blood chemistry monitors with newly available, portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitors, heat flux tags and doppler ultrasound technology for assessing tissue blood flow. Using this multi-variable approach with trained cetaceans (bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales) performing controlled swims and dives, we will determine the hierarchy of blood flow to central and peripheral body sites to support local oxygenation and thermoregulation during submersion and surface recovery. Independent and sequential dives will be compared. Particular focus will be on central and peripheral thermal windows, and the hypoxia-sensitive vascular master switch, the brain. By correlating vascular events and blood chemistries with common physiological and behavioral markers used for recovery (i.e., breathing frequency, heart rate, stroke frequency, dive duration) in trained cetaceans under controlled conditions we will develop predictive metrics for determining the timeline for re-establishment of thermal, cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis in wild diving mammals. This will be tested on both new and previously archived data for the elite deep diver, the narwhal, during control and noise-exposed periods in the wild. This project will be the most comprehensive analysis of diving physiology for cetaceans exposed to unanticipated noise to date. For the first time the cardiac, respiratory, and energetic responses of noise-impacted wild, deep-diving cetaceans will be followed throughout escape and recovery. As such, the study will provide a comparative foundation and key physiological metrics applicable to evaluating the effect of fear and submerged exercise on other marine mammal species and even human divers. Ultimately, these metrics will enable Navy personnel to, 1) develop environmentally-sensitive schedules for acoustic activities that account for the most likely lethal and sub-lethal effects on marine mammal populations, and 2) instigate measures that will promote rapid recovery and resumption of normal behaviors by affected animals.less",

        "abstract": "During the past two decades, oceanic noise including Navy sonar has remained one of the most controversial and debated stressors aff\"\"ecting marine mammal populations. Although it has been linked to numerous mass stranding events involving deep-diving cetaceans, ide\"ntifying the actual cause of injury has been difficult. This is due to the fact that scientists are just beginning to understand how\" marine mammals respond to anthropogenic disturbances. Specifically, we do not know how the suite of conflicting biological response\"s associated with escaping noise interacts in marine mammals to result in tissue injury or death. Only after determining the physiol\"ogical consequences of, 1) diving deep and fast, 2) performing escape maneuvers, and 3) surviving disrupted metabolic control during\" submerged flight will we be able to make the link between abnormal behaviors by marine mammals and harm by aversive oceanic noise.\" To address this, the main purpose of the pr\"\"oposed study is to determine the physiological consequences of escape responses in cetaceans, and to develop the key metrics for acc\"urately predicting short- and long-term energetic impacts of anthropogenic noise on diving mammals. Our approach considers that anth\"ropogenic disturbances that harm marine mammals are associated with extreme, conflicting physiological responses (high speed and ele\"vated stroke frequencies coupled to bradycardia and metabolic suppression) that occur with submerged escape. We focus on cetaceans d\"ue to the sensitivity of this group to oceanic noise, their vulnerability to developing decompression syndromes, the lack of biologi\"\"cal information regarding anthropogenic threats, and concern over the number of cetacean strandings attributed to Navy sonar. Usign\" a lab-to-field protocol with trained and wild odontocete cetaceans ranging in body mass from 50 kg porpoises to 3500 kg killer whal\"es, we will test the central hypothesis, that the unique biological adaptations that normally enable cetaceans to safely complete a\" dive are overridden during escape responses and pose a risk to metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis. Four specific aims are pro\"posed, 1) determine energetic costs and physiological risks of evasive manuevers by dolphins and whales, 2) build allometric regress\"\"ions for predicting gait-specific stroking costs for small and large cetaceans, 3) assess the physiological effects of metabolic dia\"\"pause in diving cetaceans particularly for maintaining heart-brain integration, and 4) apply energetic/physiological metrics to pred\"ict the cost of escape in free-ranging cetaceans exposed to anthropogenic noise. Custom heart rate-accelerometer instruments and blood flow monitors combined with open-flow respirometry will be used to determine the capacity for submerged escape by cetacea\"ns. We will develop a suite of metrics (peformance costs, evidence of cardiovascular anomalies, relative risk to neural function, at\"ypical behaviors) to define acute and chronic impacts due to oceanic noise. By combining data for small and large cetaceans from thi\"s proposal and our previous work, we will complete an allometric analysis that will allow investigators to translate behavioral and\"\" accelerometer data collected previously or in the future into energetic impacts for animals responding to noise. Thus, results from\"\" this project will be directly applicable to all cetaceans, will represent the most comprehensive energetic analysis for free-rangin\"\"g cetaceans, will represent the most comprehensive energetic analysis for free-ranging cetaceans to date, and will provide critical\"\" data for population threat models. Importantly, the project will accomplish the overall objective of improving the protection of ma\"rine mammals during Naval operations by enabling Navy personless",

Hybrid systems are dynamical systems with intertwined continuous and discrete behavior. Hybrid controllers are algorithms that involve logic variables, timers, memory states, along with the associated decision-making logic. The combination of such mixed behavior, both in the system to control and in the algorithms, is embodied in key future engineering systems. The future autonomous systems will have variables that change continuously according to physics laws, exhibit jumps due to controlled switches, replanning of maneuvers, on-the- y redesign, and failures, while the control algorithms require logic to adapt to such abrupt changes. Hybrid behavior also emerges in such engineering systems due to their complexity. In fact, communication events, abrupt changes in connectivity, and the cyber-physical interaction between vehicles, humans, robots, their environment, and communication networks lead to impulsive behavior that interacts with physics and computing. The intellectual impact of the proposed research plan stems from a novel use of hybrid control theory, one that leads to experimental data-driven learning algorithms for hybrid systems that are not only robust but also optimal.

Identifying where marine organisms are most concentrated can reduce the frequency of negative Navy-wildlife interactions. Biological hotspots (areas of intense biological activity that promote feeding activity in higher trophic level species) have become an important monitoring tool for describing locations where certain species and environments are at greater risk. However, the research community lacks detailed information about the location of biological hotspots in the marine environment. Large marine vertebrates such as whales, seals, seabirds and sea turtles have been identified as ecosystem sentinels, or indicators of overall ecosystem processes and climate change impacts. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are an ideal vesselfor detecting hotspots of biological activity in the ocean because they are fast, quiet, far-ranging, and deep diving. Our research group co-leads a long-term elephant seal monitoring program which contains the tools to review what is known about hotspots and to understand how hotspots vary across scales using drones, stable isotope analysis, and instruments attached to animals. The research program can facilitate valuable quantitative skills development for undergraduate students, highlight career opportunities in the DoD workforce, and train graduate students to facilitate a safe field environment for future scientists. The proposed work cannot take place without considering the ethics of animal handling and compensating young field researchers. Thus, we propose a holistic research program for conducting Navy-relevant research on biological hotspots grounded in ethical considerations and experiential learning. The characterization and subsequent avoidance of knownbiological hotspots pertaining to foraging, reproduction, migration, and multi-species aggregations of marine animals would be advantageous when planning Naval exercises. Avoiding these areas would not only reduce the direct impacts on the organisms, but also potential negative rippling effects to coastal communities dependent on ocean ecosystem services such as ecotourism and fisheries.Approved for public releaseless",

A major problem is the occasional mismatch between the type of injury and the type of surgeon available to treat it. Telerobotic surgery is a means to mediate the narrow spectrum of available front line surgical expertise. To date, most R & D efforts on medical robotics for the battlefield have focused on the remote site (the manipulator) with little focus on the critical man-machine interface which is the surgical console. The objective of the proposed project is to develop, fabricate, integrate, and experimentally demonstrate the functionality of a multimodal surgical cockpit (surgical console) enabling telesurgery capabilities which expand the range of surgical expertise to the level dictated by the type and nature of wounds in the battlefield. Through the proposed cockpit, the one or multiple expert surgeons located in the continental US will be able to collaborate while interface with different manufacturers\"end effector robots through a universal interface and perform a surgical procedures on solider located anywhere around the globe with a reduced workload and enhanced situational awareness. While the proposed surgical cockpit will be designed specifically for controlling surgical manipulators, it can also provide a unique and innovative console design elements which could be beneficial to all warriors using remote systems, such as UAV, UGV, etc.less",

The proposal aims at finding holistic security solutions for these systems using a multi-disciplinary approach. We will develop unique results such as information theoretic encryption techniques, provable secure control algorithms, novel key exchange and authentication protocols, and attackresilient multi-agent systems that can be useful for many types of military applications including the Internet of Military/Battlefield Things. The main goal of this proposal is to protect the confidentiality, security, and recovery of the information in a disruptive environment. To address these challenges, we will develop an interdisciplinary approach that will bring together three different fields: (1) Control theory for hybrid and cyber-physical systems, (2) Information Theory, and (3) Cybersecurity. The combination of these three fields will allow us to model the dynamics and algorithms used by these cyber-physical systems, secure their communications, and detect potential attacks. Our goal is to develop algorithms and protocols that enhance the security of Internet of Military/Battlefield Things against state sponsored hostile actors to the highest possible degree. Our proposal includes participation of graduate and undergraduate students in this program using UCSC internal funds. For graduate students, we intend to recruit minority and underrepresented graduate students using UC sponsor Cota-Robles scholarship. We will also leverage on our relationship and collaboration with California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and UC LEADS programs. We will continue sending our graduate students as \u00d3ambassadors\u00d3 for outreach to nearby high schools and community colleges with significant number of minority students to encourage these students to pursue STEM higher education.less",

Specific to bacteria, ions play a large role in homeostasis and contribute to the communication among bacteria in a colony. Here, we will develop electrophoretic bioelectronic pumps integrated in a microfluidic chip that accommodates cultures of B. subtilis. These pumps will be able to deliver ions and nutrients to B. subtilis to study their communication as a function of nutrient continent. Specifically, we will monitor B. subtilis membrane voltage in the presence of ionic or chemical actuation and explore whether we can control the oscillation in time and space of membrane voltage that have been observed in microfluidic cultures with nutrient shortage.

The first research goal is to develop definitions of graph classes motivated by triadic closure --- the idea that vertices with common neighbors are likely to be connected by an edge. There is tremendous empirical support for this property in social networks, and this property seems to lead to graph classes with more exploitable structure than the other most widely accepted properties of social networks, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions. 2. The second research goal is to develop structural results for the graph classes we define, to understand what these graphs ``look like.'' This is a familiar strategy for understanding restricted graph classes, analogous to using separator theorems to make precise how planar graphs resemble grids, tree decompositions to quantify how bounded-treewidth graphs resemble trees, and the regularity lemma to describe how dense graphs are approximately composed of ``random-like'' bipartite graphs. Such structural results are interesting in their own right and provide a flexible foundation for algorithmic applications. 3. The third research goal is to develop algorithms that solve problems more effectively for graphs in the proposed classes than for worst-case graphs. Empirically, many optimization problems that are notoriously difficult in the worst case, such as finding cliques or dense subgraphs, are solved to near-optimality in social networks by fast heuristics. Narrowing the gap between this theoretical intractability (in the worst case) and empirical tractability (in social networks) of these problems is a concrete and practically relevant challenge for algorithm analysis ``beyond the worst case.'' Specific opportunities include provably polynomial-time or fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for problems that are NP-hard in worst-case graphs; approximation algorithms with better approximation ratios for social networks than in the worst case; and algorithms for the approximate recovery of planted solutions.less",

We propose using our existing dataset, along with new data form our ongoing elephant seal field work to explore the specific physiological mechanisms that link body condition and reproduction to better understand how energy status integrates with allostatic load to modulate reproductive effort. We will develop and refine the following metrics associated with physiological measures of body condition that allow detection of pregnancy or the timing of reproductive suppression and provide insights into the physiological mechanisms that link body condition to gonadal function. We will examine the following issues: we will use standard hormonal assays to detect implantation, pregnancy, and mediators of gonadal function that link body condition and foraging success to reproduction in northern elephant seals; we will examine whether there are unique signatures within the diving behaviors of pregnant vs. non-pregnant female elephant seals, using our condition indices determine the thresholds that are associated with implantation and termination of pregnancy; and lastly determine the maximum and minimum condition thresholds for survival in both adults and pups.less",

When such materials are synthesized, it is crucial to thoroughly characterize them so that of intrinsic properties (e.g., the electronic and topological properties of the material) or extrinsic properties (i.e., defects). Moreover, if the structural characteristics at the nanoscale can be systematically studied and correlated with the synthesis methodology, the methodology can be altered to optimize the quality of the material. The proposed instrument will consist of a high power, rotating anode x-ray diffractometer optimized to determine the structure of the thin films, heterostructures, and multilayers. In particular, the system will have excellent angular and lateral spatial resolution with high x-ray intensity, characteristics which are crucial for the characterization of ultra-thin films (films thinner than approximately 2 nm). For antiferromagnetic thin films which could be used in THz spintronics, the crystalline quality, interface roughness, and strain can significantly affect their magnonic properties. The system will allow rapid characterization of the structure of the films, both in- and out-of-plane, to identify the structural factors which optimize the films\u00d5 spintronic properties. For two-dimensional materials, where samples consist of flakes which are on the order of 100 \u00b5m in lateral size, the focused beam (approximately 50 \u00b5m in diameter) capabilities of the system will allow the measurement of single flakes, allowing the determination of their structure (for example, the type of stacking in multilayered samples). The combination of high intensity and high lateral resolution will approach the capabilities of synchrotron-based measurements, making high quality routine characterization of our samples in our lab, thus increasing sample quality and reproducibility. Researchers other than the PI and Co-PI at UC Santa Cruz who synthesize thin films and are interested in neuromorphic computing and optical sensors will also benefit from this new instrumentation. From an educational point of view, the instrument will help train a new diverse generation of scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering. UC Santa Cruz students at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be trained to use the instrument through collaborations of their advisors with the PI and Co-PI. Undergraduate students from community colleges in California will use the instrument as part of an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program led by the PI. High school students participating in the summer Science Internship Program (SIP) at UC Santa Cruz, will use the instrumentation as part of their research activities. The PI will give presentations at minority-serving high schools in Northern California which will include remotely controlling the instrument to generate data live during the talk to illustrate basic concepts of interference and crystal structure.less",

        "abstract": "Many two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and topological insulators (TIs) are promising for the development of electronic components with new capabilities for defense-related applications, such as sensing and information processing. These 2D material nanoscale devices are highly tunable platforms that enable unprecedented manipulation of emergent quantum properties, such as quantum confinement, superconductivity, and dissipation-less metallic edge states. By implementing these materials into nanoscale devices, their unusual correlated quantum properties can be exploited for novel technological applications. Unfortunately, the intriguing quantum properties of these materials are affected or even destroyed by exposure to air and water. Environmental control is thus crucial for studying the fundamental properties of novel electronic components based on air-sensitive 2D materials. In order to address problems with air contamination that preclude many fundamental studies of the properties of air-sensitive 2D materials, this proposal requests support for the acquisition and setup of a glove box system for fabrication and characterization of 2D quantum material devices at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), a minority serving institution with over 30% Hispanic enrollment. The proposed glovebox is equipped with tools for 2D material device fabrication, such as an optical microscope, a spin coater and a thermal evaporator. It is also equipped with characterization tools well suited for 2D material devices, such as a state-of-the-art atomic force microscope (AFM) and a four-point probe station. The proposed equipment is a unique and versatile system, with only a few comparable systems available worldwide. Hence, the proposed system will enable unprecedented landmark studies on pristine, air sensitive 2D material devices. The proposed glove box system will enhance the research facilities and increase the impact of current and future research on materials at UCSC. It will also enhance undergraduate and graduate student education/training with regards to materials. As a result, the quality of UCSC STEM programs in general and the education and training capabilities of the emerging Materials Science and Engineering Initiative (MSEI) at UCSC will be enhanced significantly. These positive impacts are possible because equipment such as the proposed glove box system and its integration with existing UCSC facilities are unmatched in labs around the world, and therefore, will enable transformative research in the area of 2D materials electronics. Importantly, these studies will be driven by the efforts of graduate and undergraduate students, and thus the proposed glove box system will directly contribute to the scientific training of these students who will perform cutting edge scientific research. Moreover, summer interns from high-achieving community colleges that are Hispanic Serving Institutions will participate in these research projects during their summer research internships. Additional efforts will be made to include local high school students and/or teachers into research projects that utilize the proposed glove box system as well.less",

On one hand, stringent performance and complex nonlinearities of space systems demand the use of optimal control. On the other, uncertainty in any control systems is ubiquitous. It degrades performance of optimal control, and can potentially cause failure in control systems. Recently, a new framework, Riemann-Stieltjes (RS) optimal control, has been proposed to explicitly address uncertain in optimal control setting. In the proposed research, we will explore RS optimal control framework to mitigate the uncertainty in space control systems. We will conduct research on the following topics: 1) analyzing modeling issues in Riemann-Stieltjes optimal control, especially on handling different objectives in constrained problems; 2) developing computational algorithms to improve the efficiency for problems with higher dimensional uncertainty, and conducting research to analyze the performance of the developed algorithms; 3) investigating feedback implementation for optimal control of uncertain systems; 4) testing the results on space control applications. The proposed research will improve control performance of spacecraft, and enrich scientific missions of satellites; thus benefits general public. Moreover, the outcome of the proposed work is portable to other control systems. The algorithms developed in this project provide engineers with new ways to solve uncertain optimal control problems in challenging engineering applications, for example, motion planning of autonomous vehicles, an area with many industry applications and interests. The research work also enhances high education by engaging graduate students into interdisciplinary training on modeling, computational mathematics, and engineering implementations.less",

        "abstract": "In conventional design processes, the design of the plant, the controller, the prototype as well as the certification of validity are products of consecutive phases of development utilizing distinct simulation, fabrication, and synthesis tools. Each phase produces an \u201coptimal\u201d solution, which is typically not jointly optimal for all phases. Phases need to be restarted from scratch if a new edge case or catastrophic failure is discovered at a later stage, and the interaction between failures, fabrication tolerances, and model inaccuracy is murky at best. Instead, we propose to combine rapid prototyping, hybrid systems techniques for modeling and control, formal verification, and quantified uncertainty and risk models for systematic autonomous system development. New advanced systems have raced ahead of our ability to analyze them, while advanced manufacturing technologies allow us to quickly and inexpensively build them. The Physical Design Optimization (PDO) paradigm we propose rapidly prototypes the design, validates its fabrication, and quantifies both its performance and its failure risk by conducting physical tests of the prototypes. This allows the PDO process to rationally improve this combined representation without being subject to reality-gaps in simulation, and without requiring catastrophic restarts when new edge cases and failure modes are discovered.less",
