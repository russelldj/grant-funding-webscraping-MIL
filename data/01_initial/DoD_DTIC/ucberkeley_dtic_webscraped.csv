0,"High-Fidelity, 2D Noise-Resilient Superconducting Quantum Processors",National Security Agency,to Irfan Siddiqi,"We propose to design, fabricate, and benchmark planar 2D superconducting processors with = 8 qubits and 2-qubit gate fidelities = 0.99. We leverage a toolbox containing submicron Josephson junctions/arrays and high-coherence, passive microwave circuit elements including capacitors, superinductors, and co-planar waveguide resonators. Our approach does not rely on circuit elements for which robust fabrication techniques have not been developed (eg. phase-slip elements and cos(2À) elements) or qubit architectures where a clear route to logical gate operation has not been proven (eg. 0-p or other topological qubits). We adjust the ratios of EJ/EC and EJ/EL to realize two unexplored noise-resilient qubits: The High-Coherence Fluxonium that encodes quantum information in matter and the Multi-Photon Cat where, in the presence of an intense 2-photon microwave drive, information is encoded in photonic degrees of freedom. We have thoroughly simulated both designs and have also fabricated proof-of-concept devices. We will (i) pair these next-generation matter and photonic superconducting 2D circuits with a robust, high-fidelity CZ gate (originally developed for transmons in the HiPS program); (ii) quantify and mitigate decoherence due to dielectric loss and non-equilibrium quasiparticles, integrating our recently demonstrated Q > 5M Nb co-planar resonators into qubit circuits and establishing coherence limits due to these mechanisms; (iii) use charge-sensitive sensor qubits for characterizing correlated quasiparticle errors; (iv) mitigate quasiparticle losses by fabricating circuitry on suspended membranes; (v) use both quantum-information and condensed matter methods to characterize many-body noise processesÑincluding correlated logical errorsÑin a multi-qubit processor; and (vi) execute standard quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform to validate quantum processor performance. Our integrated theory effort will support and extend these experimental efforts. We will (i) optimize gate performance and qubit lifetimes using machine learning techniques and realistic models of the environmental noise and drive cross-talk; (ii) optimize readout fidelity by accounting for nonidealities such as memory effects and basis hybridization; (iii) characterize and model the environmental noise by mapping its spectral density using correlated sensor-qubit data; and, (iv) study and develop protocols to mitigate sources of dynamical dephasing. For High-Coherence Fluxonium qubits, we will (i) simulate 2-qubit gates with a charge multi-path coupler; (ii) explore implementations of the 2-qubit fSim gate family that includes CZ and iSWAP as special cases; and (iii) design tunable 2-qubit gates that use both charge and flux couplers, as well as multi-path interference. For Multi-Photon Cat qubits, we will (i) model coherence limitations and analyze alternate circuit designs that address those limitations; (ii) design faster, noise-biased single-qubit gates; and, (iii) explore novel interactions suitable for implementing multi-qubit gates. We will also close the loop in the qubit design innovation chain by correlating the following: materials imperfections, measured coherence, logical gate fidelities, measured noise-spectra, and error reconstruction based on quantum verification/validation protocols. This is a fundamental research project that is not expected to produce any developmental items. Should any developmental items result from this work they will have both civilian and military applications.less","11,918,116",2022,2026

0,OPTION 1: Implementation of novel benchmarking and error management protocols in planar transmon processors,National Security Agency,to Irfan Siddiqi,"The proposed research aims at optimizing three types of two-qubit quantum logical gates in a planar superconducting transmon processor: the cross-resonance gate, the geometric phase gate (M¿lmer-S¿rensen Gate), and the controlled phase gate (Zeno gate). The first is implemented via microwave irradiation of one qubit at the excitation frequency of its capacitively coupled neighbor. With improvements in coherence times at the level of 100 ÀÀs and beyond, and quantum control methods to suppress spurious couplings. These improvements will take us from our current value of 93.7% two-qubit gate fidelity to an ultimate operation fidelity of 99.9%. The two other proposed gates are novel circuits which, on the basis of preliminary numerical simulations, are predicted to exhibit raw fidelities in excess of 90%. A research focus is to demonstrate the first realization of these gates, followed by subsequent optimization to achieve fidelities at the 99% level. The geometric phase gate developed is a novel superconducting qubit implementation of the M¿lmer-S¿renson gateÑa work horse in the atomic physics communityÑbased on the generation of cavity mediated coupling between two transmon qubits using additional microwave sideband drive tones, analogous to the laser light induced mechanically mediated coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom of ions in a Paul trap. Finally, using extensions of the quantum Zeno effect, we propose a new controlled phase gate in which the higher levels of the transmon are excited and strongly measured to inhibit certain inter-level transitions, effectively inducing a ""pi"" phase shift on a target two-qubit state. Improvements to superconducting quantum processor hardware include the design and integration of multiple stages of frequency specific Purcell filtering to permit the strong coupling of control lines to qubits, thereby minimizing crosstalk, without a significant increase in environment induced decoherence. Additionally, quasiparticle reduction techniques based on engineering the on-chip phonon density of states will be incorporated into multi-qubit chips. These designs modifications will be co-introduced with materials improvements targeting the removal and passivation of lossy surface dielectric layers introduced at each step of the qubit fabrication process. To further enhance performance, quantum control methods to (i) optimize drive pulses utilizing gradient based routines and machine learning algorithms, (ii) suppress crosstalk and spurious operating frequency shifts using dynamical decoupling sequences, and (iii) randomly compile gate sequences to suppress coherent errors will be developed and implemented. Finally, to diagnose the performance of the quantum processes described, extensions of randomized benchmarking techniques which yield information about specific noise models and consider coherent and non-Markovian effects are proposed for evaluation. In addition to these projective measurement based routines, simultaneous, continuous measurements of two coupled qubits will be performed to diagnose the onset of gate infidelity, particularly targeting correlated errors.less","5,019,212",2018,2022

There are clear needs to develop insights of RHPs at various length scales and time scales once adsorbed onto the porous particles and form a monolayer membrane and characterize the phase behavior of RHP-covered nanoparticles.

0,Rational Design of Statistical Heteropolymers as Biomimetic Enzymes and Binders,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Ting Xu,"Chemical and biological warfare agents (CBWAs) pose a severe safety threat to mankind. Due to their extreme toxicity at ultra-low concentration, high sensitivity/selectivity detection and on-demand neutralization without transportation and minimal handling are particularly important yet challenging. Bioremediation using bacteria, protein binders and enzymes are proven effective, but are not suitable for in-field application due to poor stability. Recently, we demonstrated that by encoding statistic pattern of monomer distribution in random heteropolymers (RHPs), it is feasible to generate polymers mimicking intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). RHPs succeed in stabilizing proteins in non-native environment, assisting protein folding during translation, and fabrication of enzyme-containing fabrics for in-field organophosphorus degradation in both aqueous and organic solvents. In nature, abundant IDPs are found to catalyze reactions and bind substrate for signal transduction. Here, our Berkeley/MIT joint team proposes a synergized experiment/computation effort toward iterative design of RHPs capable of catalyzing and selectively binding toxin molecules in both aqueous and organic solvents.less","2,484,465",2019,2024

0,Program on Security Institutions and Violent Instability,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Leonardo Arriola,"Abstract: Developing countries around the world increasingly face violent irregular threats in the form of insurgency and terrorism. Many developing countries, however, have proven unable to effectively deploy their security institutions, military and civilian, in responding to those threats. The problem for U.S. policymakers and military planners is that existing research cannot explain much of the cross-national variation in the performance of security institutions in tackling violent irregular threats. The Program on Security Institutions and Violent Instability seeks to advance our understanding of how the design of security institutions (e.g., military, police, paramilitary, militia) can affect the capacity of countries to combat violent irregular threats. We specifically propose to assess how the institutional features of state security forces, including structure factors (such as inter-service coordination rules) and system factors (such as promotion policies), shape their ability to undertake sustained counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns. We will examine how such institutional differences influence whether countries can deter the onset of violent irregular threats, defeat existing violent groups, reduce the number of civilian and combatant deaths, and increase the duration of periods without violent activity. The Program on Security Institutions and Violent Instability will pursue its research objectives through a multi-method approach. First, we propose to assemble and statistically analyze a cross-national Domestic Security Institutions (DSI) database with systematically coded information on security institutions and their inter-service relationships. Second, we propose to produce paired case studies of six countries that share a common set of threats, but exhibit considerable variation in their success combating those threats: Colombia and Mexico; Ethiopia and Nigeria; and Burma/Myanmar and the Philippines. Third, we propose to conduct a survey of security personnel in the Philippines, where multiple types of security institutions have been employed in combatting insurgency and terrorism with varying degrees of success. This study will have direct implications for U.S. defense missions across command regions and across services. By accounting empirically for differences in the performance of critical security institutions, this project will contribute to the development of objective diagnostic metrics for anticipating how partner countries, particularly in fragile and transitional states, might respond to the outbreak of insurgency or the emergence of a terrorist network within its borders. Additionally, the data and analysis generated by this project will enable policymakers and military planners to better target security sector assistance and reform programs to the institutions within partner countries most likely to respond positively.less","1,836,044",2017,2020

0,Probabilistic and Relational Inferences in Dynamic Environments (PRIDE),Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Avi Pfeffer,"Uncertainty on the modern battlefield makes mission planning and decision making extremely complex for field commanders. Mission planners can be aided by initial and ongoing situation assessment, future state estimation, assessment of the current plan""s probability of success, what-if analysis, and suggestions for decisions. At present, few automated tools exist to provide mission planners with the required information. An automated tool to assist mission planners must deal with both the inherent uncertainty and the complexity of the situation. Charles River Analytics proposes a system for Probabilistic and Relational Inferences in Dynamic Environments (PRIDE), an approach based on probabilistic relational models (PRMs). PRMs use probabilities to handle uncertainty while capturing the logical and relational structure of a situation to handle complexity. We base our implementation of PRMs on probabilistic programming (PP), which provides a powerful and flexible way to represent probabilistic models using the power of programming languages. We propose to design and develop a full-fledged prototype of our PRM and PP engine, to design and develop temporal reasoning capabilities, and to design and develop decision-theoretic reasoning capabilities.less","1,499,383",2011,2011

0,Exploiting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Extreme Performance,United States Department of the Army,to Nicholas Marini,"Advances in DNA sequencing technology have generated a rapid expansion of human genome information and the revelation of extraordinary individual-level genetic variation.  Individual genome sequencing will soon be routine and cost-effective.  To exploit this resource to the benefit of warfighters, we propose an approach for identifying and characterizing genetic variants that compromise metabolic efficiency (and ultimately physical and cognitive performance) yet are amenable to nutritional optimization.  There are 600+ cofactor-dependent enzymes in the human proteome, and preliminary studies provide ample precedence for the remediation of dysfunctional enzyme variants by simple vitamin/mineral supplementation. We describe a technology platform in which all possible enzyme variants are functionally assessed and pre-determined for each enzyme/gene.  These datasets will serve to rapidly identify carriers of variant enzymes who can metabolically benefit from cofactor supplementation.  In Phase I, the key technical aspects of the approach have been validated.  These include:  1) generating comprehensive variant libraries of target genes through a simple, minimal-step process for functional testing, and 2) assessing function of all possible single-nucleotide variants simultaneously by quantitative complementation in a model organism (the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae).  The validation of these processes makes gene atlas generation achievable at a scale large enough to provide meaningful data for genome interpretation.  In a first-use scenario, these studies will facilitate Phase II efforts to query all genes (N = 13) related to clearance of homocysteine, an intermediary metabolite in methionine/one-carbon pathways.  Elevated homocysteine levels can have adverse effects on physical performance and cardio-respiratory fitness, though the metabolic steps surrounding homocysteine are amenable to nutritional “tuning”.  Specifically, we will define the functional impact of all possible single-nucleotide changes within this metabolic cassette to serve as an information resource used to identify at-risk individuals.  These finding will spur a field trial in which individual genotype and metabolite profile are diagnostic for potential performance enhancement, as well as define a first product for subsequent commercialization.  This pioneering work will render genome sequence an asset to improve health, fitness and readiness.less","1,094,874",2021,2023
0,New Concepts for Mobile Radiation Detection and Mapping Systems,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Kai Vetter,"Recent advances in the fabrication of detector materials and readouts, machine vision, and autonomous systems and their control enable unprecedented capabilities in the search, localization, and characterization of nuclear and radiological materials. The integration of these advancements into autonomous platforms, such as small, unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), will significantly enhance the speed and accuracy in the detection and mapping of nuclear materials, particularly in complex and inaccessible environments while minimizing the exposure of the warfighter to hazards. We propose to study the fundamental properties of the relevant sensing and control components to enable a network of mobile sensors. The sensing components consist of new generations of organic scintillators along with solid-state photodetectors. Fundamental properties in the design, fabrication, and operation of these new materials will be explored to enhance the sensitivity and specificity in the detection of gamma rays and neutrons associated with special nuclear materials. Techniques to 3D print these materials will be explored and their utilization as structural components of detection systems and platforms as well as their arrangement to modulate and moderate incident radiation to improve localization capabilities. These basic aspects will be studied in combination with machine vision concepts required for the control of the mobile detection units to enable the mapping and reconstruction of 3-D environments and the fusion with radiological data. The control components entail new concepts in the effective deployment of mobile networks to minimize the search time utilizing algorithms to compute theoretic quantities represented as probability distributions over the environment states.

0,Emergent Order and Quantum Information Flow in Non-equilibrium Systems,United States Department of the Army,to Norman Yao,"Understanding the dynamics of strongly-interacting systems composed of many particles is a prerequisite for controlling complex quantum phenomena. While the equations of motion governing these dynamics have been known for almost a century, solving them in full generality is simply too difficult. Fortunately, a combination of analytic, numerical and experimental progress has led to the development of insights and tools that bridge the gap between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic quantum behavior. These insights suggest a remarkable proposition: that out-of-equilibrium systems can stabilize many-body entanglement and exhibit phenomena fundamentally richer than their static counterparts. However, predicting and measuring the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central open challenge in physics. Part of this challenge stems from the fact that many-body systems can be taken out of equilibrium in a variety of different ways, each with its own set of expectations and guiding intuition. Among others, this plenitude of non-equilibrium strategies include: periodic driving, prethermalization, strong disorder, quantum quenches, and dissipation. To this end, the overarching goal of this proposal is to explore quantum phenomena, which can only be realized via the cooperative synergy between multiple non-equilibrium techniques. In particular, we propose to investigate two intertwined questions: first, what are the novel types of emergent quantum order that can arise in systems, which exhibit a combination of disorder, driving, and dissipation. And second, how do the microscopic dynamics of quantum information in such systems lead to late-time, macroscopic steady-states. We will address these long-standing questions by developing: 1) analytical techniques which bound the speed-limit for quantum information flow, 2) massively-parallel computational methods which enable large-scale quantum dynamics simulations, and 3) a novel experimental platform composed of two different species of strongly-interacting spin-defects in the solid-state. In addition to answering fundamental questions in the broad landscape of quantum physics, our results will directly impact a number of applications - such as quantum metrology, computing, and communication - which rely upon the production, preservation, and manipulation of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems.less","1,000,000",2021,2026

The foundational networks will be tested on the tasks as Scale-MAE in Phase I, and we will also benchmark performance for key point matching. Phase II will extend our Scale-MAE work by integrating additional metadata into the network to increase accuracy by providing it with more information; we will extend the approach to handle inputs including NTM, multi-spectral, and SAR data. Finally, the downstream task networks will be transitioned into NGA SAFFIRE for integration and evaluation.

0,Quantum Adiabatic Interferometry,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Dan Stamper-Kurn,"This projects supports the development of a new approach to trapped-atom interferometry, named quantum adiabatic interferometry, and its application toward precise sensing of acceleration, rotation, and other effects. The project is divided into three main tasks. First, project researchers will develop advanced optical systems for producing optical box potentials, in which atoms are trapped in a dark, un-illuminated volume, while being surrounded with a ""wall"" of high intensity light. When this light is blue-detuned from atomic transitions, these walls confine the atoms in the dark volume, within which they experience no potential energy variations or other disturbances from the trapping light. A goal of this task is to produce box potentials with high contrast of light intensity between the trapping volume and the optical walls, to confirm that optical trapping can be performed with light close to atomic resonance, thereby reducing the optical power requirements, and to develop optical systems with a small footprint in terms of size, weight and power. A second task is to provide a near-perfect microgravity environment for trapped atoms within stationary on-Earth setups. For this, a precise electromagnet set, to provide a magnetic field gradient whose force on atoms cancels the gravitational force, will be modeled, wound, tested, and demonstrated to produce residual accelerations at the micro-g level. The third task is to demonstrate long-lived coherence in a box-trap atom interferometer, in which a quantum-coherent gas of atoms is adiabatically divided into two separate containers, allowed to evolve freely for variable time, and then used for phase-sensitive matter-wave interference. An overall goal of the project is to demonstrate all the necessary techniques and principles to use quantum adiabatic interferometers for inertial sensing.less","885,698",2020,2022
0,Degenerate quantum gases of transition metal atoms,United States Department of the Army,to Dan Stamper-Kurn,"This effort aims to extend the application of laser and evaporative cooling to a new family of elements. The specifi c aim of this project is to create an ultracold, quantum degenerate gas of titanium atoms. A scheme is proposed wherein titanium atoms are excited to a metastable state, the a5F5 atomic state. Two closed optical transitions are identified, at wavelengths near 498 and 1040 nm, that permit the application of standard laser-cooling methods to metastable titanium atoms. A four-phase research effort is outlined, with the goals of (1) assembling and testing a titanium atomic beam apparatus, and applying optical pumping to prepare atoms in the a5F5 state, (2) Zeeman slowing and magneto-optical trapping of titanium atoms in the metastable state, (3) magnetic or optical trapping of atoms in the metastable state or in one of the fine-structure states of the a3F electronic ground level, and (4) preparation of quantum degenerate gases in the fine-structure ground state. Success in this project will open the door to new scientifi c directions, such as the study of ultracold gases in mixtures of different angular-momentum states and subject to polarization-dependent off-resonant light fields, the study of long-lived spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases and their possible topological low-energy phases, new variations on atom interferometry enabled by the polarization-dependent optical interactions and the plethora of metastable states in the titanium spectrum, and the study of stable spin-2 spinor Bose-Einstein condensates.

However, locomotion in arboreal environments or irregular high-slope terrain, is relatively unexplored. Saltatorial locomotion, with continuous high acceleration jumps, allows traversing gaps as well as acceleration off of high-slope surfaces. The main focus of this proposed research is to understand how to robustly use saltatorial locomotion on challenging surfaces which can have high compliance, high slope, and irregular features. We expect that saltatorial locomotion models for these environments will require high acceleration and dynamic range, combined with appropriate structures and new control strategies to achieve some of the robust 3D performance on complicated terrain demonstrated by saltatorial animals. These models will be verified both through simulation and with real hardware. The experimental part of this research is enabled by the Saito robot. Saito is capable of repeated jumps in the saggital plane with a vertical jumping agility of 1.7 m/sec, which is 78% of the animal with the highest vertical jumping agility, the galago.

0,Rational design of enzyme-containing materials,United States Department of the Army,to Ting Xu,"Synthetic materials are still rather simplistic compared to their biological counterparts. Proteins draw upon a diverse library of chemistries. They fold into precise hierarchical structures. Lastly, they possess selective responses to specific stimuli. Proteins, however, are typically not amenable for use outside of their native biological environment. Recently, we demonstrated that statistical trends in protein surface chemistry could be exploited to develop rationally designed random heteropolymers (RHPs). RHPs participate in interactions that mimic the behavior of chaperone-active intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Experimentally, RHPs behave like chaperones and have been verified to stabilize a wide range of proteins in otherwise denaturing solutions. This has led to enhanced protein processability and adaptability in a variety of applications. Although all results have been positive with several enzyme-based functional materials demonstrated, they raise significant challenges to our fundamental understanding in the hybrid biomaterials and the fundamental design rules to interface synthetic and biopolymers. For this renewal proposal, we organized a team with complimentary expertise, i.e. polymer science and biostatistics, and aim to address two questions: 1. The quantification of various processing parameters that govern the macroscopic activity of enzyme-containing materials. This is to harvest successes we have achieved up to this point and to pave the path toward functional materials that meet demands to fully realize the technological potential of protein-containing materials and to better serve the community. 2. Development of understanding in the origin of observed success in terms of RHP stabilizing proteins regardless of specific protein characteristics and inherent variations in the RHP. Specifically, we will focus on analyzing and synthetically controlling the statistical segmental heterogeneity in RHPs to correlate it with the RHP solution phase behavior and protein stabilization. As a new class of polymers, RHPs present numerous opportunities yet challenge our understanding of heterogeneous systems. The proposed fundamental investigation comes from a totally new angle, i.e. statistical heterogeneity that has not been explored previously. A synergistic effort between polymeric material and statistical sequence analysis will lead to new insights in RHP design rules to bridge the gap between the synthetic and natural building blocks. Technically, enzyme-containing materials opened many opportunities to address biological function incorporation into synthetic matter to duplicate what has been seen in nature.less","810,000",2021,2024

0,"Identifying Semantic Components from Cross-Language Variation, Structured Lexical Resources, and Corpora",Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Collin Baker,"This project addresses the automatic identification of semantic components: sub-lexical elements of linguistic meaning that may be composed in different ways to capture the meanings of words. The project is specifically intended to address aspects of lexical meaning that are not easily captured in corpus-derived distributed semantic representations, but that are an important part of the underlying cognitive structure on which language and language understanding rely. To that end, this project proposes to distill such underlying structure out of three kinds of existing resources, brought into register with each other. The first is a set of cross-language datasets documenting variation in semantic categories across languages; these permit the identification of cross-linguistically recurring semantic components that may form a universal or near-universal repertoire of semantic building blocks, combining differently in different languages. The second is richly detailed lexical resources such as FrameNet and WordNet, which explicitly capture semantic and conceptual relations among words, including underlying conceptual gestalts or ""bundles"" of meaning that are central to language understanding but are rarely themselves directly expressed in language. The third is corpus-derived word co-occurrence statistics. This project will identify semantic components from the juxtaposition of such resources using methods from machine learning. It will also assess those semantic representations against human word similarity judgments, for comparison with the performance of other approaches to semantic representation.less","750,000",2017,2022
0,Robust Model for Behavior of Complex Materials during Spin Testing,United States Department of the Air Force,to Shmuel Weissman,"The objective of this project is to develop a practical finite element-based simulation of spin-pit tests of disks. The performance of disks in spin-pit tests critically depends on localized effects, such as residual stresses, dislocations, and microstructure gradients. Therefore, a two-scale modeling approach is adopted. At the global-scale, the disk is represented by means of finite elements with embedded internal discontinuities. Local-scale models are employed to account for localized effects, such as the influence of microstructure on inelastic properties (e.g., creep and plastic hardening). An important feature of the proposed approach is that it enables the simulation of arbitrarily oriented localized “softening” effects (relative to the geometry of the finite element mesh). This feature is critical because it enables the simulation of the propagation of oriented localized effects, such as fatigue cracks, independent of the mesh geometry. This project will also result in novel two-scale material models, and procedures to obtain the associated material properties. Numerical simulations of spin-pit tests of dual-heat treated disks will be used to validate the proposed development. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations will be performed. These simulations will include both steady-state disk spinning, as well as transient states (i.e., acceleration and deceleration). BENEFIT: The outcome of this project is simulation software to predict the performance of advanced turbine disks in spin pit tests. In particular, it will permit the analysis of the influence of imperfections and residual stresses, introduced during the manufacturing process, on the performance of turbine dicks. This software will enable improved optimization of disk design, leading to increased fatigue life, and reduced maintenance. In particular, it will enable reliable analyses of advanced disks such as dual-heat treated disks, which are used in the high-pressure section of jet engines for both civil and military applications. The demand for higher fuel efficiency mandates that engines operate at higher temperatures. As a result, the need for advanced disks (i.e., dual-heat treated and hybrid disks) is increasing. In fact, future advancements in jet engine technology hinges on the availability of such disks. The tool that Symplectic Engineering is proposing, therefore, is aimed at meeting a clear demand identified by jet engine manufacturers (e.g., GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce), as well as by the Air Force and Navy. For this reason, Symplectic Engineering expects to successfully commercialize its technology.less","749,999",2010,2012

XOOPIC currently contains models for electrostatic and electromagnetic models in Cartesian and axisymmetric coordinates, with a Monte Carlo model for collisions. It can model the relativistic regime, with multiple species, arbitrary placement of boundaries, and user-extensible diagnostics. Applications include low temperature plasma discharges for materials processing and lighting, high power microwave devices, basic plasma physics, space plasmas, high energy accelerators, laser-plasma interactions, and beam optics. For VLAB, XOOPIC will be extended with models for advanced physics addressing the high-voltage radiation source regime, as well as their implementation. The applications range from fundamental physics in the high-voltage, high-current environments, to high power microwave sources for directed energy weapons, to nuclear effects simulation, to novel imaging concepts for medical or materials industries.less","749,942",2005,2007
0,Novel validation methods for multi-qubit systems,National Security Agency,to Hartmut Haeffner,"A quantum computer may solve problems which can not be computed using classical computers. A major challenge is that only in specific cases the solution a quantum computer proposes can be verified with classical means. Thus, one may have to resort to a second quantum computation which must be substantially different from the first one to be a meaningful test. Here we study how quantum algorithms can be implemented differently on the same quantum computer with the goal to find methods to to validate the results of quantum computations.

0,Optimization of Sodium Guide Star Return using Polarization and/or Modulation Control,United States Department of the Air Force,to Simon Rochester,"Laser guide stars (LGS) are artificial sources of light produced by laser-induced fluorescence from sodium atoms in the mesosphere between 85 km and 100 km altitude. The fluorescence can be detected on the ground with a telescope and used as a reference for compensating atmospheric aberrations in astronomical and space observations in conjunction with an adaptive optics system. Sodium LGS are vital for the next generation of large ground-based visible-light telescopes. Additional applications include space-debris and object tracking and imaging, ground-to-satellite laser communication, and potentially even interplanetary laser communication. Laser guide stars can also be adapted for atmospheric and remote-sensing applications; in particular, LGS can be used for remote magnetometry by modulating the light beam and observing a resonance when the modulation frequency matches the spin-precession Larmor frequency of sodium atoms in the mesosphere. For any of these applications, an increase in LGS brightness would be desirable; for daytime operation it is essential. This requires experimental and computational research into new LGS methodologies. We propose work to achieve two objectives: Objective 1: Development of enhanced user-friendly LGS modeling software. The open-source LGSBloch package, developed by Rochester Scientific, is currently the primary software serving the adaptive-optics sodium LGS modeling community. However, it could benefit from major improvements in capabilities, computational efficiency, and user-friendliness. We propose to add capabilities to efficiently model pulsed and modulated light (including amplitude and polarization modulation), to model alternative and multi-level pumping schemes, including those in other potentially useful atomic systems (e.g., iron), to integrate over the laser-beam volume, and include atmospheric and mesospheric propagation effects, as well as including a user-friendly graphical user interface to facilitate use by those who are not atomic-physics specialists. Objective 2: Feasibility study of brightness-enhanced laser guide stars based on mesospheric iron. Methodologies for brighter laser guide stars would have civilian and military commercial applications including astronomy, space-object tracking, and laser-based communication. We propose to study the possibility for one such method, namely basing an LGS on mesospheric iron atoms, rather than sodium.  Mesospheric iron may have benefits including brighter daytime operation and polychromatic LGS for tip-tilt correction. The iron-LGS study will include several components: modeling single-color LGS and polychromatic LGS, investigating the benefits of polarization modulation and frequency chirping for LGS brightness, and determining whether a directed-beam iron LGS employing amplified spontaneous emission is possible. Each component of the study will include both computational modeling and auxiliary laboratory experiments for validation.less","749,508",2020,2022

GaN vertical device structures, mostly for high-power applications, have recently become available due to significant breakthroughs in quasi-bulk epilayer growth. For the first time, the influence of dislocations on device performance can therefore be neglected for such GaN-based device structures. The effect of WMD-relevant radiation (gammas and neutrons) and of space-relevant radiation (protons and heavy ions) on defect generation in GaN vertical device structures will be investigated. Specifically, the characteristics of radiation-induced defects at the devices' interfaces and electrical junctions will be the topic of this proposal.

0,Stabilization of Reactive Chemical Species and Fundamental Studies of Small-Molecule Reactivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks,United States Department of the Army,to T. Harris,"This proposal seeks to synthesize microporous, supramolecular architectures, or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and employ them to (1) stabilize and study reactive chemical species, such as terminal metal oxo and nitrido functionalities, and (2) carry out and study stoichiometric and catalytic activation of small inorganic and organic molecules, such as dioxygen and dinitrogen. MOFs are synthesized through solution-based coordination chemistry routes often associated with molecular chemistry, enabling myriad chemical tunability of structure and function. Moreover, MOFs exhibit crystalline structures that allow us to know the exact composition of each catalytic site at the atomic level, through characterization techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, various forms of spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. In addition, the rigid structure of a MOF provides a surface upon which to anchor reactive chemical species, precluding their participation in side reactions often encountered in molecular catalysts, such as bimolecular condensation and hydrogen atom abstraction. Additionally, the solid-state composition of the MOF will enable gas-phase reactions to be conducted in the absence of solvent, thereby eliminating the possibility of side reactions with solvent molecules. A key feature of this approach is that reactive chemical species will be stabilized without sacrificing their inherent reactivity. This work sets out to answer fundamental scientific questions that will translate to applications in Army Soldier protection. Our ability to establish structure-function relationships that govern interactions between MOF surfaces and small-molecule substrates in microscopic detail will inform the design of future materials with programmable responses to dangerous chemical species. In particular, our work will focus on the formation of strong solid-state oxidants from ubiquitous small molecules such as dioxygen and dinitrogen. From these studies, we will gain unprecedented insight into oxidation chemistry that occurs on MOF surfaces, which will be of use in areas such as the selective oxidative decomposition of chemical warfare agents, such as mustard gases and VX gas nerve agents, into inactive chemical forms.less","630,000",2020,2023
0,Actionable Variation in Human Genes to Enhance Metabolic Efficiency,United States Department of the Army,to Jasper Rine,"Advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to a rapid expansion of human genome information and the extent of individual-level genetic variation. While many variants are neutral, many will have a physiological impact. The ability to distinguish among these groups of variants defines the critical challenge in human genetics research for the coming years as the advent of genome sequencing becomes a routine diagnostic tool. We postulate that while some genetic variation is responsible for inherited disease, a larger fraction is responsible for influencing metabolic efficiency and ultimately physical and cognitive performance in all manner of activities. It is this latter set that we are interested in characterizing and, in particular, genetic differences that compromise metabolic steps that are amenable to optimization. To identify and characterize such metabolically remedial variants, we will focus on the effects of polymorphisms in enzymes that require a vitamin or mineral cofactor. There are approximately 600 cofactor-dependent enzymes in the human proteome, many of which play key roles in cellular metabolism. Furthermore, there is precedence for the remediation of mutant enzymes with severe or mild abnormalities by straightforward vitamin/mineral supplementation. Specifically, in the proposed studies, we will concentrate on nutritional optimization of metabolic steps essential for generating cellular energy stores (ATP production and mitochondrial function). Niacin, riboflavin and thiamine are vitamins essential for bioenergetic metabolism as either enzyme cofactors or redox substrates. Thus, we propose to analyze variation in 5 enzymes necessary for the optimal utilization of these nutrients. We will interrogate all known nonsynonymous variation in these genes for effects on enzyme function as well as on metabolic output and mitochondrial function. Importantly, we will also identify which alleles are amenable to vitamin remediation and metabolic tuning. We will use these results, in combination with our previous studies, as a springboard to learn more about the prevalence and characteristics of vitamin-remedial alleles to ultimately enable prediction of such alleles from genome variation data. This pioneering work will close the gap between the description of variation of the human genome and understanding and acting upon that information.less","625,428",2015,2020

0,Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene/Boron Nitride Moire Superlattices for High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall and Fractional Chern Insulator,United States Department of the Army,to Feng Wang,"This project aims to realize high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall insulator (i.e. integer Chern insulator) and fractional Chern insulator by controlling the electron correlation and topology in tetralayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices. Haldane first theorized that Chern insulators with integer quantum Hall effects could appear even at zero magnetic field in lattice models with broken time-reversal symmetry and complex hopping parameters. Such an intrinsic integer Chern insulator state requires two important ingredients: strong electron-electron correlation and non-trivial band topology. The strong electron correlation is needed for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, and the topological band is necessary for anomalous Hall conductance. Recent theoretical studies reveal that even fractional Chern insulator can be realized in lattice models with sufficiently strong electron correlation, where fascinating fractional quantum Hall physics emerges in zero magnetic field. Moire superlattices of rhombohedral few-layer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide an attractive platform to explore high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall insulator and possible fractional Chern insulator, because both the electron-electron correlation and the band topology can be controlled in-situ by a vertical electrical field in these moire systems. For example, previous studies of rhombohedral trilayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices have demonstrated the existence of electrically tunable quantum anomalous Hall state up to 2 Kelvin. Here the PI plans to exploit the super flat and topological moire minibands in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene/hBN moire superlattice to realize high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall and fraction Chern insulator state. Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene/hBN is predicted to feature a super flat moire miniband, which will greatly enhance electron-electron correlation than that observed in trilayer graphene /hBN system. This extremely strong electron-electron correlation will stabilize the time-reversal-symmetry broken state and the orbital ferromagnetism against thermal fluctuation. Consequently, it offers exciting opportunity to achieve high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall insulator. In addition, the super flat topological band in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene/hBN moire superlattice could be enabling for the realization of the fractional Chern insulator, a completely new topological state with fractional quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field. The PI will combine near-field nanoscopy imaging, advanced device fabrication, and magneto-transport characterization to systematically engineer the flat topological minibands in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene/hBN moire superlattices for the discovery of such high-temperature quantum amomalous Hall insulator and fractional Chern insulator.less","600,000",2021,2024

The work proposed here is motivated by studies showing that chemistry at the interface of a liquid solution can differ markedly from that in a bulk liquid or in the gas phase TIme-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) on flat liquid microjets will be carried out using femtosecond soft x-ray pulses at photon energies as high as 250 eV. These energies are sufficient to eject core electrons from phosphorous, sulfur, and halogen atoms, and the primary goal is to observe time-resolved core level chemical shifts in these atoms as a molecule undergoes photo- or electron-induced dissociation. Depending on the photon energy, the escape depth of the photoelectrons can be varied from 1-3 nm, enabling one to probe molecules within the interfacial region of the surface (roughly defined as 1 nm in depth) as well as deeper into the bulk liquid. Specific experiments of fundamental interest include the photophysics of thiouracil and the dynamics of dissociative electron attachment to bromouracil (BrU). These experiments will provide the foundation for studying molecules of interest to ARO, specifically the photochemistry and electron-driven reduction chemistry of the chemical warfare simulants malathion, parathion, and diphenyl chlorophosphate (DPCP).

Arrays of neutral atoms held individually in optical tweezer traps and driven to high-lying atomic states are one of the most powerful and promising approaches to creating such large-scale quantum devices. However, to date, these Rydberg tweezer systems have been limited by the way in which the tweezer arrays are measured. Specifically, the optical imaging methods used to read out the state of each tweezer end up requiring a simultaneous readout of all tweezers within the array, completely extinguishing the entanglement and coherence of the system. This DURIP project supports the development of a new instrument in which it is possible to measure just a selected sub-system of a large Rydberg tweezer system, while the remaining unmeasured sub-system retains its full quantum coherence. This sub-system measurement will be achieved by using a high-finesse optical cavity to perform fast, selective, state-sensitive, and non-destructive measurements of atoms in individual tweezers. The proposed system builds on an existing setup in which such sub-system measurement within a small-scale tweezer array has been just recently demonstrated. The objective of this DURIP project is to provide the equipment necessary to drive atoms up to Rydberg states, so as to introduce strong interactions between atoms in different tweezers; to impose single-qubit gates on tweezer-trapped atoms; to control the coupling of tweezer-trapped atoms to the optical cavity; and to control the overall experimental setup with precise timing control and built-in system calibration.

In a set of stacked strata that span depth of theinner plexiform layer, the the mammalian retina forms about a dozen different images representing spatial-temporal feature sets derived from input stimuli. These representations are carried intact to higher visual centers by different populations of opticnerve fibers and contain all the information we rely upon when interpreting the visual world. These parallel feture sets comprise the native representation of visual information, a kind of native visual language. Using this language, we can formulaterobust solutions to essential image processing problems such as image restoration, enhancement, and analysis, motion detection, feature extraction, and identification.

0,Rational Design of Random Copolymers to Incorporate Proteins into Synthetic Materials (Research topic: 7.3 Polymer Chemistry),United States Department of the Army,to Ting Xu,"Proteins, NatureÕs own building blocks, have many attributes unmatched by man-made materials albeit years of efforts. Rather than taking a biomimetic approach, successful integration of functional proteins into synthetic systems can readily access attributes from proteins to address challenges in the field of catalysis, sensing, medicine, molecular machinery and hierarchical structural nanomaterial. However, preservation of protein structure and functionality in non-native environment remains a hurdle to incorporate protein into synthetic material-based devices. We recently designed and synthesized statistically random heteropolymer (RHP) that can effectively solubilize model metalloproteins in organic solvents and can still maintain nearly 80% of their native activity. The ability of RHP to maintain protein property is much more effectively than that of conventional small molecule surfactants and amphiphilic block copolymers. The preliminary results opened new pathways toward protein-based functional materials. However, the system also raised numerous questions due to diverse chemical heterogeneities for both protein and RHP and the energy landscape governing protein structure. Here, we propose to: 1. Develop systematic understanding in the protein/RHP in organic solvents to delineate design principles for protein stabilization in non-native environment; 2. Extend to functional proteins that have more complex surface chemistry, especially those with large fraction of charged surfaces; 3. Fabricate nanostructured protein-based materials in the forms of fiber, thin film and colloidal particle; Fundamentally, the proposed studies will bridge the gap in our understanding at the interface between the synthetic and natural building blocks. The RHP approach eliminates the needs to perform protein surface modification and can be applied to a wide range of proteins that are incompatible with surface modification.

PROJECT SUMMARY Controlling light requires the engineering of materials, geometrical, and topological degrees of freedom to enable seemingly impossible optical effects and specially to enable novel devices and systems that are compact and power efficient. During the last decades, this control has been enabled and enhanced by advanced structures such as photonic crystals, metamaterials, and metasurfaces. The recent discovery of topological degrees of freedom brings an unprecedented new tool in the control of light. While significant progress has been made on bandgap engineering using topological concepts, it has not been extensively used to control light at surfaces or metasurfaces. Thin structures such as metasurfaces are promising as they address the small weight requirement for many Army systems. This proposal will investigate topological degrees of freedom for controlling light at metasurfaces. The project will investigate the new physics of such wave controls structures as well as novel properties enabled by topology. These devices will find applications in many Army systems where compact and efficient structures are required. The research will 1) investigate the physics of topological metasurfaces, 2) fabricate and characterize topological metasurfaces and 3) realize novel devices based on topological metasurfaces. The project objectives will be accomplished by combining expertise in the design, the fabrication, and the characterization of nanophotonic devices.

0,Online Meta-Learning for Continuous Adaptation in Multi-Task Settings,United States Department of the Army,to Sergey Levine,"Current machine learning methods, especially deep neural networks, excel in the regime where large, statistically unbiased datasets are available. However, autonomous systems that operate in continual open-world settings must be able to adapt to changes in the environment, as well as changes in the task. In these settings, it is impractical to gather large datasets for every situation and task that the system may be confronted with, and the model must instead adapt to these changes while leveraging its prior knowledge. Unfortunately, precisely those things that make deep networks well-suited for the large data regime make them poorly suited for online adaptation: their high capacity and comparatively slow learning speed means that conventional supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods adapt relatively slowly. The objective of this project would be to investigate how meta-learning and multi-task learning methods can bridge this gap, developing a new generation of online meta-learning methods that can offer efficient continual adaptation by leveraging the experience of adapting to changes in the environment and task in the past, and by distilling this past experience into a compositional and modular multi-task representation. We will aim to develop a framework for online meta-learning in the multi-task setting, studying algorithms, representations, and applications. The algorithms portion of the project will aim to develop an algorithmic and theoretical framework for online meta-learning, so as to provide a general recipe and theoretical analysis for this new class of learning methods in a general, abstract sense.

As part of this work, a framework of fundamental understanding about some of the least studied caloric effects including studies of stress-induced piezocaloric effects (sometimes called elastocaloric effects) and the potential for multicaloric response from single- and multi-material heterostructures will be developed. Building from the PIÕs study of the physics of electrothermal responses in complex oxides, the goals of the work will be achieved by implementation of a combined synthesis, processing, characterization, and materials testing approach. It will answer questions about how different ferroic order parameters (i.e., ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and/or ferromagnetism) provide for stimuli-induced entropic changes and how can we design materials/heterostructures with large effects in this regard? The specific objects of the program include: ¥ Fundamental understanding of piezocaloric effects Ð Leverage thin-film synthesis to create model and free-standing materials (with controlled order parameters, phase transformations, domain structures, interfaces, etc.) capable of unraveling piezocaloric physics. ¥ Measurement of piezocaloric effects Ð Leverage expertise in the measurement of electrothermal effects in thin films to probe stress-induced temperature changes in thin-film materials thereby opening the door for unprecedented understanding. ¥ Multicaloric effects in single materials Ð Explore the physics of multicaloric effects in single-material heterostructures wherein both electrocaloric and piezocaloric effects are possible and coupled. ¥ Multi-material, magneto-electro-piezo-caloric effects Ð Develop novel caloric effects in multi-material heterostructures wherein single (or multiple) applied stimuli drive changes in multiple, strongly coupled order parameters thus producing large caloric effects at any temperature.

The objective is to design an optimal distributed controller for a large-scale system with complete or incomplete infonnation about the model in an uncertain environment. This problem, even in the special detenninistic case, amounts to a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult to solve and remains an open problem after 50 years of study. This project aims to develop a new mathematical foundation for the design of optimal distributed controllers, which can be applied to a wide range of real-world complex networks. Local search methods are at the core of large-scale computation for machine learning problems and in particular reinforcement learning techniques via deep neural networks. These numerical methods are based on iteratively improving an existing control policy via computing some gradient and updating the parameters. In this project, we investigate the usefulness of local search for solving the optimal distributed control (ODC) problem and design a set of one-shot and sequential local search methods for solving ODC either precisely or approximately (depending on how difficult the instance of the ODC problem is). To this end, we first study the topological properties of the feasible set of the ODC problem for systems with known models, i.e., the set of all stabilizing distributed controllers ( or control policies). We analyze how many disjoint (connected) components this set has and how non-convex each component is. We study how the structural properties of the system as well as the communication architecture of the controller affect the topological properties ofODC. Using this analysis, we characterize how hard each sub-class of ODC problems is, how many communication channels are indeed among the local controllers to make the problem tractable, and how to design local search algorithms to find the best controller possible. Our mathematical framework combines local search with a homotopy technique to avoid becoming stuck at poor local (sub-optimal) solutions. For systems with incomplete knowledge about the model, we use reinforcement learning and first study how local search for policy update affects the perfonnance and then design better learning techniques for finding a near-globally optimal distributed controller in this setting. We perfonn case studies on real-world systems with DoD applications (such as control of a network of autonomous agents to cooperatively perfonn a task).

0,Nonlinear Dynamics and Distributed Control for Soft Robot Locomotion Research Topic: 1.0 Mechanical Sciences: 1.3 Complex Dynamics and Systems,United States Department of the Army,to Oliver O'Reilly,"The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop models and associated control schemes for a soft robotic system that is designed to locomote on a range of surfaces. In order to advance understanding of the robot's dynamics, the design and fabrication of the robot will be intimately linked to the modeling and control efforts. This synthesis is motivated by the complementary needs of modifying the robot design so as to improve the fidelity of the models and minimizing the sensor requirements needed for a control scheme. The latter scheme features networked sensors and control that achieves synchronization and other global patterns using local connections. The aforementioned control scheme has the potential to advance the state of the art in soft robotic locomotion. However, before it can achieve its potential, a complementary set of questions needs to be addressed and the specific scientific issues the proposal addresses include the following: (i) What frictional laws and reduced-dimensional theories in mechanics (e.g., elastic rod theory, shell theory, plane-strain linear elasticity) best capture the mechanics of soft robots limbs, typical contacting substrates, and their tribo-elastic interactions? (ii) What are the natural boundary conditions that govern unilateral contact, and how are these influenced by the adhesion and dissipation arising from inelastic deformation or stick-slip behavior? (iii) As in natural organisms, how can friction and adhesion be actively tuned to control the tribo-elastic interactions of soft-rigid or soft-soft contacts and support dynamic locomotion or robust grasping? (iv) In the area of dynamics and control of a soft robotic system with distributed sensing and actuation, to what extent can the natural dynamics of a soft, flexible structure be exploited in its closed-loop operation? And (v) how might one apply tools from the control of networked systems to design a feedback control system for a soft machine with many spatially distributed sensors and actuators? The team at UCB will construct a hierarchical modeling framework to describe legged locomotion using nonlinear dynamics and continuum mechanics in a manner conducive to control. A hierarchy of three mathematical models will be developed featuring thermo-mechanical rod theories with a parallel effort on computer animations of the complex motions predicted by each model. Complementing this work, the team at CMU will perform an empirical and theoretical study of tribological interactions for ground contact with a soft robot limb. Because of their low mechanical rigidity, soft-bodied organisms and robots undergo significant deformation and conform to surfaces with which they make contact. This unilateral contact occurs over large areas of the body surface and introduces tribological effects that can strongly influence motion, power consumption, and internal stress distributions. Finally, the team at UMD is the design and implementation of a distributed nonlinear controller for legged locomotion using sensor feedback. This task will utilize the dynamic models from Task 1 and the soft-robot testbed constructed in Task 2. The focus is on a distributed estimation and networked-control framework with a coupled oscillator model for coordinated leg motion and hybrid spine control of intrinsic curvature, curvature, and geometric torsion. The project will develop high-fidelity, dynamic models for nonlinear control of a highly deformable body. These models will be far more sophisticated than those currently used in soft robotics. Indeed, since undulatory motion has many more degrees of freedom than traditional locomotion in robotic systems such as the robotic cockroach, a hierarchy of state-space models with clearly defined force inputs is proposed for analysis and control.less","360,000",2016,2019
0,"Next Generation Natural Language Interfaces for Data Extraction, Manipulation,and Visualization",United States Department of the Army,to Alvin Cheung,"The information deluge has greatly increased the difficulty for users to access and manipulate data. The proliferation of data processing frameworks does not help much in that regard, as users now need to master both the processing framework's programming interface and ways to express their data processing tasks using them. Interfaces that utilize natural language (NL) utterances to generate code have recently become attractive as they allow users to specify their computation without writing any code. Unfortunately, due to the ambiguous nature of NL and scalability issues, current deep learning-based code generators can only understand small fragments of NL utterances, and are often limited in their application domains and the complexity of the generated code. In this project, we will drastically improve the scalability and usability of NL-to-code interfaces by leveraging recent advances in deep learning, program synthesis, and mixed initiative user interfaces. Our focus will be on users with data interaction needs and are capable of basic programming tasks, but are otherwise non-experts in coding. Specifically, we will study the following aspects of the problem: - Current NL-to-code generators focus on generating code in isolation from the rest of the development environment. However, as code is rarely written entirely from scratch, such an approach misses the vast amount of code context that is available, such as the partial code fragments that users have written, program variables that are in scope, and the available code comments. To address this, we will develop new deep learning models and algorithms that leverage such contextual information together with NL utterances in code generation, for both disambiguation and improving training efficiency. - We will explore different modes of interaction to incorporate into NL-to-code interfaces during development. For instance, building mixed initiative interfaces that solicit input-output examples and demonstrations from users in addition to utterances, and integrating semantic parsing as part of code execution rather than a separate offline process. The latter will augment the code generator with runtime information (e.g., values of variables), which will raise new challenges in building efficient inference and memoization mechanisms to reduce code generation overhead during program execution. - We will investigate means to provide feedback to users. For instance, designing algorithms to effectively identify ""adversarial"" inputs that can be used to query the user to prune down the program search space, and constructing dialog systems that interact with the user to iteratively refine the generated code, for instance as a means to optimize the performance of the generated code over time. To evaluate, we will deploy our techniques and prototypes to solve classical code generation tasks, such as generating SQL queries from NL. We will also construct new tasks as well to showcase the power of our approach, such as data transformation (e.g., changing the shape of input data to call training methods provided by a machine learning framework), and generating interactive data visualizations from large data corpus. The PI will leverage his expertise in both formal methods and natural language processing in this project. He has a track record in publishing in those fields, along with multiple early career awards and best paper citations in the past.

Bacterial microcompartments offer tunable scaffolds to organize and sequester such reactions within the cell, and thus can serve as a new, multipurpose device in the synthetic biology toolkit. With this work, we develop design rules for assembling and using such a device. In this progress report, we outline our progress toward the previously delineated milestones and objectives. Notably, we recently published a paper in Journal of Biological Chemistry that describes how N-terminal tags can be used to control the compartmentalized levels of two proteins at once. We also gained a deeper understanding of mechanisms for tuning encapsulation levels, and made progress in developing assays that probe questions about microcompartment shell assembly.

0,"Turbulence, symmetry, and the role of organism shape in perception: Fundamental Laws of Biology (3.3.1)",United States Department of the Army,to Evan Variano,"The goal of the proposed work is to describe the effect of symmetry-breaking morphology on how organisms perceive the world while suspended in a turbulent flow. The three components of the research are laboratory measurements, a stochastic model, and the exploration of how perception depends on organism shape and symmetry. Laboratory measurements will use unique and powerful techniques that PI Variano developed and used previously for measuring axisymmetric objects in turbulence. Custom- fabricated transparent particles will be constructed in a wide variety of fundamental and biologically-inspired shapes. Particle motion will be measured along Lagrangian trajectories, revealing the distribution of particle rotation and the scales at which particles filter the surrounding flow. The method is robust and quick, so that a large number of different shapes can be investigated in a short amount of time, revealing how different features affect the passive motion of particles in turbulence. A stochastic model will be created that incorporates the laboratory results and leverages recent advances in modeling the turbulent velocity gradient tensor. The model will predict the motion of particles as a function of size and shape. The shape-space will contain key features that may confer selective advantage on organisms, including fins, tails, dorsal-ventral differentiation, and anterior-posterior differentiation. The stochastic model will be used to test the following hypothesis: bilateral symmetry represents a maximum in Òperceptive stability.Ó Perceptive stability is the degree to which an organismÕs sensory system is able to engage with a single environmental cue. This hypothesis is formulated to apply to all environments, and the proposed work will test it in the specific context of turbulent flows. In such a context, the hypothesis is that bilateral symmetry minimizes fast rotations, compared to cases of spherical symmetry, radial symmetry, and complete asymmetry. The proposed work will address for the first time the biomechanical impact of organism shape on life in turbulent environments. These results will provide insight into the evolutionary history of animal life; the split between bilateral and radial organisms is one of the fundamental steps in early evolution, and is a possible reason for the Cambrian explosion of biodiversity. The results can also contribute to Òtrait-basedÓ ecology, in which trophic interactions are described in terms of how organisms experience the environment. Overall, the hypothesis to be considered herein is a potential fundamental law of biology, of basic interest to the field. The results could also be used practically to accelerate the field of vehicle design, by providing guidance on vehicle shape and location of sensors. The schedule of the work is as follows. Year 1 will include 10 months of continuous data collection, with 2 weeks spent on each of 20 particle shapes. Year 1 will also include analytic and numerical construction of the model. Year 2 will be focused on specifying the modelÕs free parameters using the laboratory data. During year 2, a second campaign of data collection will focus closely on 8 additional particle shapes, measured for 5-6 weeks each (11 months total). Year 3 will continue the second data collection campaign, with 4 more shapes measured for 5-6 weeks each (6 months total). The main focus of year 3 will be to use the numerical model to evaluate the hypothesis. Throughout all three years, results will be shared with the community; extra effort will be made during years 2 and 3, to integrate the results in the biological literature so that these new biomechanical results can support the existing genomic methodology.less","359,998",2016,2019

0,High Fidelity Control of an Multi-Ion Register,United States Department of the Army,to Hartmut Haeffner,"Quantum information processing (QIP) relies on high fidelity control of complex quantum sys- tems. Arrays of trapped ions are a leading candidate due to the innate all-to-all connectivity of the qubits and long coherence times which enable complicated simulation and gate-based compu- tation. However, these rich dynamics cannot be accessed without reconfigurable gates across an ion register and small electric and magnetic field noise. Our laboratory has pioneered the scientific understanding and reduction of motional heating due to electric field noise, but so far has not put the infrastructure in place to scale up to high fidelity control of a multi-ion quantum processor. Here, we propose to upgrade an existing ion trap apparatus to a small scale quantum information processing device by adding a novel innovative reconfigurable single-ion addressing unit as well as a magnetic shield to improve coherence times. The apparatus features already a custom developed ion gun for surface treatment which does not impede optical access. We hope to improve both motional as well as electronic coherence of 40Ca+ -ions in a Sandia HOA 2.1 trap to 100 ms and beyond. We expect that this rare combination of long coherence times in a scalable room temperature surface trap with multi-qubit control will allow single- and multi-qubit operations on strings of tens of ions with fidelities in the range of 0.999 and above. This would enable studies of efficient calibration of ion trap quantum computers, methods to extend coherence times using auxillary ions, parameter estimation for multi-qubit systems, and certification of quantum processes.less","278,055",2021,2022

Understanding these phenomena is key to the Chemical Sciences Program of the Army Research Office, with its focus on determining the pathways and intermediates for fast chemical reactions and energy transfer mechanisms in molecular systems. The charge migration dynamics induced by ionization, also known as Òhole dynamicsÓ, represent a purely electronic time scale in chemistry and occur on a timescale of less than 5 fs. As such, they can be probed using attosecond techniques available in our laboratory (1 attosecond=10-18 sec). In the proposed experiments, a few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulse will ionize a target molecule by strong field ionization. The resulting hole dynamics will be probed by absorption of a broadband attosecond pulse, using attosecond transient absorption (ATA) spectroscopy at photon energies above 280 eV, the energy at which K-shell core-to-valence transitions in carbon become accessible. ATA in this soft x-ray region provides elemental specificity and is also sensitive to the charge state and chemical bonding environment of the atoms being probed. The proposed research focuses on three initial target systems: glycine, the simplest amino acid, uracil, the RNA nucleobase, and PENNA (2-phenylethyl-N,N-dimethylamine), a model system for hole transfer between two well-separated functional groups. All three molecules contain multiple chemically inequivalent first row atoms, each of which will have distinct and charge-sensitive core-to-valence transitions that can be probed in our experiment.

The closed-cycle superconducting magnet provides a magnetic field up to 9 tesla with low vibration, and the microscopy optical cryostat allows for sample cooling down to 4 Kelvin within the magnetic field. Coupled with the tunable femtosecond lasers, the cryogenic magneto-optical system offers the capability to perform broadband optical micro-spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy at different magnetic field strengths. We will utilize this new magneto-optical system to further the goals of our DoD MURI project entitled ÒCenter for Advanced 2D Organic Networks (CATON)Ó which is focused on developing new 2D covalent organic network and explore their novel physical and chemical properties. Many fascinating quantum phenomena arise from the competition between the kinetic and potential energy. In particular, strongly correlated behaviors ranging from magnetism to fractional quantum hall states can appear when the kinetic energy is strongly suppressed such as in flat electronic bands. Recent theoretical studies of our MURI team identified novel 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a flat electronic band. With strongly enhanced electron-electron interactions in 2D materials, such flat electronic band provides exciting opportunity to explore strongly correlated physics and magnetism in 2D COFs. The new magneto-optical system will enable the first experimental study of flat-band magnetism and correlated phenomena arising from strong correlation in 2D COFs. We will additionally explore magnetism in the heterostructure of 2D COFs and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), where the flatband magnetism of COF can couple to the spin-valley degree of freedom in TMDCs. Students and postdocs at all levels will be exposed to cutting-edge optical spectroscopy and 2D COF materials, and will learn how to develop new experimental probes and to interpret new forms of data relevant to understanding nanoscale electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior, as well as being schooled in how to deliver effective presentations and write impactful journal articles.less","248,127",2018,2019
0,Mycorrhizal potential to protect plants from pathogens and promote productivity,United States Department of the Army,to Claire Kremen,"Pollinators contribute to the production of three-quarters of crop species globally. Therefore, research that characterizes mechanisms that enhance pollinator populations and pollination services is critical to promoting food security. Soil microbial communities affect plant species in a myriad of ways. Soil microbial activity influence soil health with cascading effects on floral traits such as flower size and number, and nutrient composition of pollen and nectar. These floral traits affect pollinator resources, visitation and nutrition, and thus soil microbial communities indirectly have the potential to alter pollinator health and pollination services. The indirect connection between the soil microbes and plant-pollinator interactions is largely understudied. This project will investigate the connection from the soil microbiome (both beneficial fungi such as mycorrhizal fungi and harmful, pathogenic fungi) to floral traits, pollinator visitation and pollination, through a combination of molecular (i.e. ribosomal RNA sequencing) and biochemical characterization (i.e. high-performance liquid chromatography), greenhouse experiments and common garden observations in the field. Soil microbiome characterization will be completed in year 1 and the greenhouse experiments and common garden observations will begin in year 1 and be completed in year 2. This project will test the hypothesis that beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the soil microbiome improve floral rewards and positively affect pollinators and pollination. Further, it will investigate whether AMF provide a protective function that prevents the detrimental effects of harmful soil-borne fungal pathogens that may decrease plant growth and, hence, the availability of floral rewards for pollinator nutrition. A combination of responses between pollinator and soil health will be explored: the effect of beneficial AMF alone on pollination and the effect of soil-borne pathogenic fungi with or without AMF on pollination. Elucidating the mechanisms by which soil health (e.g. diverse communities of beneficial AMF impacts plant-pollinator interactions will determine what factors support pollinator communities that could translate to increased food security. An expectation is that diverse communities of beneficial AMF will have both direct and indirect benefits on pollinators and soil health that may translate into positive effects on food security and pollinator community composition.less","246,576",2017,2019

0,Variable Emissivity Thermal Control Capability Development for Space based Applications,United States Department of the Air Force,to Jianjian Wang,"Keeping an orbital asset at an optimal operating temperature is extremely challenging as orbiting spacecraft experience large temperature swings, the difficulty in getting hardware into space, the limited amount of volume and power available on spacecraft, and the restriction that any heat that is released from a spacecraft must leave radiatively. Radiative cooling using a high-emissivity coating proves to be a very effective way to reduce high surface temperature in orbital conditions where atmosphere is absent. However, the coating would continue to undesirably cool the surface at low temperatures, worsening the temperature swing. To address this challenge, various smart radiation devices are under development to realize variable emissivity based on the temperature of radiating surfaces. However, these devices require temperature sensors, control circuits, and additional electrical power input. In this STTR program, ACT and the UC Berkeley propose to develop a space temperature-adaptive radiative coating that automatically senses the temperature and switches emissivity from a high value at high temperatures to a low value at low temperatures. The proposed technology allows us to achieve large difference between low and high emissivity states (differs by at least 0.5) and provide excellent thermal control for both high and low temperature extremes.less","149,999",2022,2023

Sensing gravity anomalies and comparing them to a gravity map can provide positioning immune to the drift of purely inertial navigation systems. Existing gradiometers with sufficient sensitivity are large and heavy, requiring manned aircraft and helicopters for their operation. This makes comprehensive high-resolution gravity mapping slow, risky in terrain-hugging (low and slow) flight, and expensive. We propose to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle with an integrated atom-optic gravity gradiometer. Such a system combines the unparalleled sensitivity of quantum sensors with the utility of an unmanned aerial platform. This sensor would eliminate risk to a flight crew, make surveying less conspicuous, and allow automated terrain-hugging flight.

This approach is integrated with strategies that facilitate the simulation of shock waves that may develop as a result of extreme pressure engendered by the hypervelocity impact. The other level addressed is that of the material models. In Phase I, Symplectic Engineering chose to consider polycrystalline materials, coated with a silica-based ceramic thermal shield.

0,Solid Propellant Shock to Detonation Modeling and Formulation,United States Department of the Air Force,to Shmuel Weissman,"The objective of this project is to develop software capable of predicting shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) of solid propellant formulations. SDT is prompted by localized events, occurring at the meso-scale (material) level, and leading to hot spots (e.g., adiabatic shear bands, hydrodynamic hot spots, and void collapse), which trigger violent chemical reactions. However, for the reaction to be able to propagate, the diameter of the propellant must be above a (propellant dependent) critical value for which chemical energy generation exceeds loss processes. A multi-scale finite element based model is employed to simulate SDT in composite solid propellants. This approach permits the incorporation, in a single analysis, of meso-scale structure effects such as void collapse, with the macro-scale characteristics such as the external diameter and bore shape of the solid propellant. A coupled thermal-mechanical-chemical model represents the propellant. The proposed approach will be implemented in a nonlinear finite element code.

A multi-scale finite element model is proposed that enables the incorporation of macro- and meso-scale effects in a single analysis. An important feature of the proposed approach is that it enables the simulation of localized effects that are arbitrarily oriented relative to the geometry of the finite element mesh. This feature is critical because it enables the simulation of the propagation of oriented localized effects, such as fatigue cracks, independent of the mesh geometry. A numerical simulation of a spin-pit test of a disc of simple geometry will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

In order for nanotechnology to mature, diagnostic instruments must be developed to detect and analyze physical and chemical properties with spatial resolution much less than the dimensions of the nanostructures (materials and devices). The basis of this proposal is to address this need by expanding the capabilities of LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy) to the nanoscale.

DBP is a modified resistless, maskless manufacturing technique (compliant to Executive Order 13329) performed within a single cluster tool with capability to perform patterned etch, deposition, and implant processes thereby reducing both direct and indirect costs and lead times. Direct growth of LaAlO3 / SrTiO3 material using patterned atomic layer deposition (ALD) is possible within such a process tool. The Phase I feasibility study will identify core DBP techniques for manufacturing high density multi-component oxide heterostructure (MCOH) devices.

0,Multi-Task Scale Aware Continuous and Localizable Embeddings,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,to Christopher Funk,"NGA uses deep networks for many tasks including image registration, land cover segmentation, and object detection. Current deep learning approaches develop specialist networks for each task and type of data. Not only is this inefficient, because networks can’t be reused across tasks, this approach ignores correlations between tasks and data sources that can improve performance. In response, we will develop MultiSCALE, a scale-aware, task-conditioned network designed to operate across multiple, mutually supporting tasks. Multi-image tasks are typically performed by matching the ground sample distance (GSD) of the images, usually through information destroying down-sampling. Instead, MultiSCALE conditions its feature extraction on metadata, such as GSD, viewing angle, solar angle etc. generating features that model these differences. Crucially, rather than train a feature space that is invariant (blind to) to these differences, MultiSCALE’s metadata conditioning makes the network aware of differences, such as absolute size. Cascaded task conditioning will improve performance, for example detecting objects while using land cover to guide the search. MultiSCALE will create a general network, trained to perform many tasks across varying resolution data at their native resolutions, increasing network re-usability and improving task performance to support NGA’s imagery analysis.less","99,998",2022,2023

It is the primary cause of death in approximately 30% of injured soldiers who die from wounds. Early diagnosis of the onset and severity of hemorrhagic shock is critical for providing effective combat triage and optimizing survival. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of applying a nonparametric, kernel-based technology called Similarity Based Modeling (SBM) to a set of readily field-measured vital signs from a wearable, mobile sensing device for improved visibility into health status in humans. Kernel-based modeling technology has been shown in commercial applications to map otherwise unknown interrelationships between instrumented variables using empirical data. Such mapping can be used to predict/infer non-instrumented signals, such as predicting an unmeasured pressure from other, measured parameters of a system. Furthermore, the empirical mapping of these interrelationships can provide ensembles of expected values that can be compared to measured values to ascertain incipient deviations from normal system behavior. These capabilities mean (a) values can be predicted for physiological parameters for which no direct measurement can practically be made, and (b) differences between measured values and “expected” values can indicate physiological instability that is about to cascade into a physiological emergency.less","99,132",2008,2009

0,Bonded Joint Analysis Method,United States Department of the Navy,to Akhilesh Jha,"Adhesive bonds are increasingly finding their applications in aerospace and automotive structures. The adhesive bonding gets rid of fasteners, thus reducing stress concentrations and damage initiation sites. In addition, elimination of fasteners results in significant weight savings. In order to use adhesive bonding with confidence and certify integrity of bonded structures, certain issues regarding the integrity of bonded joints need to be addressed. The key issues that need to be addressed are - strength prediction, durability, damage tolerance, and non-destructive inspection. The focus of this study is to quantitatively predict the strength of a general bonded joint under multi-axial loading. The main difficulty with modeling a bonded joint is how to consider a generalized mode of failure emanating from multi-axial loading. In this work, we advance the traditional cohesive zone finite element method by replacing empirical failure criteria of limited traction-displacement curves by stress-based generalized failure criteria obtained from first principle but validated through experiments. While this method does not eliminate the need to experiments, it does provide a comprehensive approach to model failure of bonded joints.

0,STIR: Many-body localized quantum information processing in AMO systems,United States Department of the Army,to Norman Ying Yao,"The coherent control and manipulation of complex quantum systems is one of the central challenges in modern atomic, molecular and optical physics. The majority of ongoing research in this direction focuses on building up this complexity starting from individual, isolated degrees of freedom. In contrast, the opposite approach, where one seeks the coherent local manipulation of a strongly interacting system is generally thought to be intractable. The main difficulty, of course, is the exponentially growing Hilbert space with a typical many-body eigenstate strongly coupled to an exponentially dense set of other states. We propose to explore an alternate approach toward the coherent control of many-body ""qubits"", following a new paradigm introduced by recent studies of strongly interacting, disordered quantum systems. In particular, we propose to investigate a novel architecture for quantum information processing based upon the many-body localized phase. In thermal phases, the quantum coherence of individual degrees of freedom is rapidly lost to the environment. By contrast, many-body localized (MBL) phases limit the spread of this coherence and appear promising for quantum information applications. In particular, the slow-growth of entanglement in the MBL phase implies a relatively long intrinsic dephasing time-scale. Thus, quantum information stored in such many-body localized states could be extremely robust to decoherence. In addition to information storage, we propose to explore many-body localization as a new method to protect the transport and manipulation of quantum information. Together, the faithful storage and transmission of quantum information is the basic building block for applications ranging from information processing to communication and metrology. In a traditional architecture, quantum bits connect via channels that coherently shuttle information between remote nodes. Constructing such a channel from an interacting many-body system at high temperature is generally considered impossible; once quantum information disperses into the system, it rapidly decoheres due to scattering with thermal excitations. To avoid this, typical quantum channels, such as mechanical resonators, optical photons, superconducting strip-lines, and spin chains, are either specially tailored few-body systems or operate at ultra-low temperatures in order to freeze out parasitic degrees of freedom. Many-body localization offers an alternate strategy where such parasitic degrees of freedom are locally confined via disorder and thus, cannot cause decoherence. On the flip-side, to better characterize the failure of thermalizing quantum systems as platforms for information processing, we will explore the rate of scrambling in such systems. Scrambling refers to the process by which a localized bit of quantum information becomes entangled and hidden within complex many-body correlations under time evolution. The information in such a ÒscrambledÓ state has not been lost, since the final state is unitarily related to the initial state, but most of the information about the initial state is inaccessible to any reasonable local measurement. By understanding the nature and rate of scrambling in conventional many-body systems, it may be possible to identify alternate strategies to slow such dynamics, including the using of near-critical phases.less","75,000",2017,2018

Consequently, the rim zone of disks operates at high temperatures where creep is the main concern. The bore and web zones operate at lower temperatures, where strength is the driving design criterion. Procedures to produce disks that can meet both demands include dual heat-treatment and hybrid disks. A thin transition zone forms in disks produced with either of these technologies, which is characterized by location-specific three-dimensional microstructure and residual bulk stresses. The objective of this project is to enable the optimization of advanced nickel-base superalloy turbine disks by developing probabilistic modeling and simulation methods to predict location-specific microstructure and bulk residual stresses. Symplectic Engineering is proposing to develop a multi-scale model to meet this objective. The global (disk) scale will be represented as a coupled thermal-mechanical system, approximated by a three-dimensional finite elements model. A number of models will be combined to produce the local-scale representation including gamma-prime coarsening and grain growth. The two scales will interact independently at each Gauss point of the global-scale finite element mesh.

River charts can be nonexistent or inadequate because of changes in water volume, tides, sediment transport, flooding, and other events. This is a hindrance and a hazard for navigation and other operations. Currently, procedures to map rivers involve navigating surface vessels into regions with significant uncertainty, which can be labor-intensive and dangerous. A better alternative is possible using low-cost sensors that float downstream, collecting data. Passive ""drifters"" have proven useful to research groups mapping ocean currents. However, faster flows and more constricted morphology in rivers present challenges. Passive floating sensors converge to similar streamlines and thus geographic coverage is limited, and can also get trapped or damaged by river features.

0,Tuning mechanical properties of architected materials by manipulating stresses and inelastic behaviors,United States Department of the Army,to Grace Gu,"Title: Tuning mechanical properties of architected materials by manipulating stresses and inelastic behaviors PI: Dr. Grace X. Gu, University of California, Berkeley ARO program manager: Dr. Daniel Cole, Mechanical Behavior of Materials Cellular structures are types of porous materials and are prevalent as building blocks in nature. Such structures with open-cell arrangements are referred to as lattice structures and are oftentimes praised for their high strength-to-weight ratio, energy absorption, and heat transfer properties. A common feature of lattice structures employed in modern engineering applications is a symmetric configuration of repeating unit cells. The main benefit of using repeating unit cells is a greatly reduced design space, making its mechanical properties more amenable to tuning to meet a specific response criterion. This feature, however, has a major drawback: when one unit cell fails, the other unit cells will successively fail under a given loading condition, causing a sudden and catastrophic failure in the structure. Recent literature has shown that the damage tolerance or toughness of lattice structures can be increased by using asymmetric and irregular unit cells created by modifying their orientation. However, such irregular lattice structures often need to sacrifice strength to achieve higher toughness. Currently, there is a knowledge gap in understanding how to manipulate the architecture and deformation behaviors of irregular lattice structures to better balance the tradeoff between strength and toughness. Additionally, methods to create irregular lattice structures often involve rotating the unit cells, which poses a challenge for joining unit cells at interfaces and can lead to a significant strength reduction due to stress concentrations. The project objective is to design and manufacture novel irregular lattice structures and discover fundamental knowledge to overcome the tradeoff between mechanical properties by manipulating stresses and inelastic behaviors. Unit cells in lattice structures typically consist of beam elements with the same shape. This study, however, considers the shapes of beam elements in each unit cell as additional degrees of freedom for the design of irregular lattice structures. The local behaviors (e.g., deformation, buckling, failure) of each beam element and its contribution to the global mechanical properties, inelastic behaviors, and failure mode of architected materials will be examined. Moreover, this work aims to elucidate new mechanisms that can trigger the brittle-ductile transition of architected materials. It is hypothesized that by tailoring the spatial distribution of the beam elementsÕ radius, additional fracture energy dissipation mechanisms can be introduced with less reduction in the strength and stiffness. The specific aims of this program are as follows: 1) Understand how to control the mechanical properties of irregular lattice structures by adjusting the shapes of the beam elements; 2) Investigate how stress distributions vary locally in irregular lattice structures and potential to manipulate areas of high and low stress concentrations. A suite of irregular lattice structures will be additively manufactured with varying spatial distribution patterns and size distribution functions. Then, their mechanical properties such as modulus, strength, and toughness will be measured in experiments. A numerical model will be created to predict stress distributions and investigate the behavior and failure sequence of beam elements. The failure sequence of beam elements can provide insight into new mechanisms to trigger the brittle-ductile transition of architected materials such as crack detouring and buckling. The proposed research integrates computational mechanics, additive manufacturing, mechanical characterization techniques to design lightweight cellular structures with tunable mechanical properties for a variety of Army applications.less","60,000",2022,2023

Its presence in the environment from legal historical discharge poses a significant health threat. Current analytical technologies for identifying and quantifying perchlorate at low levels are based on ion chromatography with conductivity or mass spectrometry detection.

It is based on perchlorate reductase activity and couples NADH oxidation to perchlorate reduction, with phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as an electron shuttle. Hence the amount of perchlorate in an aqueous sample can be determined enzymatically by monitoring the amount of NADH oxidized spectrophotometrically (i.e., by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm). The instrumentation for the bioassay is an ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer. The equipment and materials are relatively inexpensive, and the bioassay potentially may be performed by less highly trained personnel than required by ion chromatography (IC) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analytical methods. Thus it was thought likely that the benchtop bioassay might supplement more expensive and time-consuming analytical procedures as a screening test for perchlorate in groundwater to facilitate tasks such as mapping plumes and monitoring perchlorate levels during remediation.The objectives of this project were to: (1) Compare benchtop bioassay results from testing in the laboratory to results from a reference analytical method performed by a commercial laboratory; (2) Compare results with a benchtop bioassay kit format tested by site field personnel to the site’s routine perchlorate detection method; and (3) Evaluate the ease of use of the benchtop bioassay kit format.less",2009,‐,

Commonly, biomarker development has focused on identifying nucleic acid sequences, peptides, proteins, or lipids of organisms that catalyze biodegradation reactions of interest.

0,Treatment Train for In Situ Mineralization of PFOS Using Heat-activated Persulfate Oxidation (HAPO),Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Lisa Alvarez-Cohen,"Due to the complex composition of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs), none of the existing treatment techniques can effectively mineralize all per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present at sites impacted by AFFFs. Thus far, heat-activated persulfate oxidation (HAPO) is the only in situ technology that can mineralize perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and many polyfluoroalkyl substances. Recently, SERDP-funded research showed that perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) can be transformed by a laccase-mediator system into shorter chain polyfluoroalkyl substances. To expand the technology to treat the full suite of PFAS, a method is needed to convert perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSA) to PFCA or other species that can be mineralized by HAPO. An integrated treatment that can mineralize PFCA, PFSA, and polyfluorinated compounds would help the Department of Defense (DoD) meet its need for a holistic treatment tackling the diverse PFAS at AFFF-impacted sites.While coupling this laccase-mediator treatment with HAPO seems like a logical, innovative step, additional research and development is needed to determine the feasibility of this strategy. The goal of this proof-of-concept project is to evaluate the potential for using enzymatic laccase treatment in conjunction with HAPO to mineralize PFOS under conditions relevant to in situ treatment. The approach consists of two crucial steps: 1) assess rates of PFSA transformation that can be achieved by a mediator radical system activated by laccase enzymes; and, 2) assess the potential for using HAPO to mineralize the products of the mediator-laccase system.less",2020,‐,
0,A Simple and Robust Forensic Technique for Differentiating PFAS Associated with AFFF from other PFAS Sources,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to David Sedlak,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are released to the environment from a variety of activities, including firefighting, plating, chemical manufacturing, municipal wastewater treatment, and waste disposal. In locations with multiple sources of PFAS, remedial efforts and PFAS source attribution can be facilitated by forensic tools capable of quantifying the relative contributions of different PFAS sources. In a limited number of situations, exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been used to differentiate among suspected PFAS sources. These initial approaches employed principal component analysis with measured concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and a small number of polyfluorinated compounds to assess the contributions from sources known to be present at the site. To apply these methods to more complex sites where multiple PFAS sources exist and the PFAS signature has been altered by biotransformation and preferential partitioning to soil and sediments, more sophisticated and thorough data analysis methods are needed. Such methods can integrate data from a broader suite of analytes, providing a more accurate and meaningful source assessment.To advance PFAS source attribution under complex conditions, this project will collect a detailed fingerprint of different PFAS sources prior to applying EDA methods. To provide a breadth of PFAS analysis, the project team will extend the Total Oxidizable Precursor (TOP) assay through separation and selective oxidation of polyfluorinated compounds. The project team will also investigate maximizing the accuracy of the EDA assessment by including data that are relatively inexpensive to collect (e.g., divalent cations, hydrocarbon surfactants, fluoride).less",2020,‐,

0,"Assessment of Physical, Chemical, and Biological Factors Controlling Biotransformation of Cationic and Zwitterionic Precursors in PFAS Source Zones",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Lisa Alvarez-Cohen,"The objective of this project is to assess the fate of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) after their release to soil and sediments in locations where aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) has been released. Specifically, this project aims to provide a better understanding of the sorption and subsequent biotransformation and release of cationic, zwitterionic, and neutral PFAS from source zones under environmentally relevant conditions. The project team hypothesizes that biotransformation of these polyfluorinated compounds, which are often referred to as perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) precursors, will result in the release of more mobile anionic PFAS species, including PFAAs. The project team also hypothesizes that the physicochemical properties of the soil and sediments, as well as the redox conditions of the source zone, will affect relative rates of chemical release.less",2023,‐,
