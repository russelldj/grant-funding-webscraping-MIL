0,Fast and Modular Spin Qubit Arrays (FMSpins),National Security Agency,to Jason Petta,"Semiconductor spin qubits have satisfied the DiVincenzo criteria for scalable quantum computing. Several research groups have recently demonstrated high-fidelity spin state initialization, readout, single-qubit and two-qubit control. This research program is focused on demonstrating fast control and readout of spin qubit arrays, as well as developing a modular spin qubit architecture, wherein two spatially separated two-qubit modules are coherently coupled through a quantum interconnect. Several promising approaches exist for long-range coupling of spin qubits, including exchange coupling through large intermediary quantum dots, circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), and the physical transfer of spin-based quantum information through charge shuttling. We will demonstrate coherent coupling of two or more two-qubit modules using spin shuttling. In parallel, the theory team will estimate the fidelity of various spin transfer protocols that are based on cQED. The theory team will also develop quantum characterization verification and validation (QCVV) protocols that can be applied to characterize the overall fidelity of our modular spin qubit architecture. In the area of quantum control and readout, the research team has two major objectives. The first is to build upon recent gains in single- and two-qubit control fidelities through fundamental investigations of the fidelity-limiting mechanisms. Current bottlenecks are limitations in the maximum Rabi frequency that can be achieved with electric dipole spin resonance, crosstalk during single qubit control due to microwave cross-coupling and residual exchange, limited dynamic range of the exchange coupling, and slow gate calibration times. A second objective is to develop cutting-edge quantum control and readout protocols that have the potential to greatly reduce the required qubit drive times and powers, significantly reduce the readout time, and enable multiplexed readout of spin qubit arrays. The team will focus on implementations involving Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, where quantum information is encoded in the spin of a single electron. LD qubits are generally controlled using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) in a magnetic field gradient and coherently coupled using the exchange interaction. While impressive progress has been made in controlling LD qubits with high fidelity, most demonstrations involve just single or two-qubit devices. Our team has been at the forefront of efforts to develop scalable semiconductor quantum devices, including pioneering demonstrations of resonant two-qubit gates, as well as spin coupling and readout using cQED.less","7,705,307",2023,2027
0,"Understanding Scenes and Events through Joint Parsing, Cognitive Reasoning and Lifelong Learning",United States Department of the Navy,to Song-Chun Zhu,"Project Summary Problem Statement The goal of this MURI team is to develop machines that have the following capabilities: i) Achieve deep understanding of scenes and events through joint parsing and cognitive reasoning about appearance, geometry, functions, physics, causality, intents and belief of agents, and use joint and long-ranged reasoning to fill the performance gap with human vision; ii) Represent visual knowledge in probabilistic compositional models across the spatial, temporal, and causal hierarchies augmented with rich relations, which are task-oriented, support efficient task-dependent inference from an agentÕs perspective, and preserve uncertainties; iii) Acquire massive visual commonsense through web scale continuous lifelong learning from heterogeneous sources through weakly supervised HCI and dialogue with humans; and iv) Understand human needs and values to interact with humans effectively and answer human queries about what, who, where, when, why and how in storylines through Turing tests. Technical Approach We take a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates four areas illustrated by the four layers: (a) Psychology and cognitive experiments; (b) knowledge representation; (c) lifelong learning; and (d) computer vision tasks in an inference engine. The four areas will be studied in tight loops shown by the arrows in 3 colors. Human experiments bring new paradigms to transform computer vision and machine learning; and the latter drive human experiments to probe the brain mechanisms for representation, inference and learning. Each area consists of a spectrum of tasks which we organize in three levels of increasing depth and complexity: (i) Categorical recognition; (ii) joint parsing; (iii) Cognitive reasoning. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team from both the US and UK to achieve our goals, including: Experimental psychology and cognition, computer vision and learning, Cognitive and mathematical modeling. Outcome and Impact Our proposed research tackles challenges of pressing importance in the following DoD missions. 1) Persistent surveillance with ground and aerial sensors. Our approach will achieve deep understanding, generate narrative text descriptions, and answer human queries. 2) Web scale commonsense knowledge acquisition and information gathering. We will expand our lifelong learning engine to discover visual and common sense knowledge from heterogeneous sources on the web, organize them into deep structured knowledge on a unified graphical representation. This will fill the semantic gaps, overcome the shortcomings of machine learning approaches. 3) Robot autonomy and situation awareness. We will develop task-oriented representations and learning, so that machines understand the underlying physics, causal-effects, functionality of objects, the use of tools, and human intents, needs and values. This will improve robot autonomy in civil and military tasks in collaboration with humans.less","7,550,262",2015,2017

0,Dissecting microbiome-gut-brain circuits for microbial modulation of host cognition in response to diet and stress,United States Department of the Army,to Elaine Hsiao,"Mammals are comprised of trillions of microorganisms, together called the microbiome, that respond to environmental factors, such as diet and stress, and have the remarkable capacity to modulate host brain activity and behavior. Despite increasing evidence that the gut microbiome influences brain development and function, the molecular mechanisms that enable microbiota-gut-brain interactions remain unclear. Fundamental principles are lacking for how complex microbial communities develop and respond to external stimuli, and unified models are needed to map the dynamic microbial, enteric, metabolic, immune and neural signaling networks that comprise the microbiota-gut-brain axis. To address this need, we will investigate how the gut microbiome alters cognitive sensorimotor and spatial learning behavior in response to variations in dietary fat: carbohydrate intake and exposure to oxygen deprivation stress. Technical Approaches. We will conduct controlled gnotobiotic and microfluidic experiments to determine how the microbiome is altered as a function of fat: carbohydrate intake and physical hypoxic stress and to uncover how these microbiome changes causally impact host physiology. These experimental data will be used to develop a multilayered mathematical model of the microbiome-gut-brain axis that examines system architecture, performance, sensitivity and robustness. Altogether, the proposed project integrates advances in functional genomics, microfluidics, gnotobiotics, metabolic modeling, optogenetics, and control theory. Anticipated Outcome: Through iterative in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiments, with cross-referenced testing of predictions across experimental systems, we will extract fundamental biological insights for i) how nutrition and physical stress modify microbial community structure and function, ii) how microbial products biotransformed through the gastrointestinal tract modulate metabolic, immune and vagal signaling, and iii) how metabolic, immune and vagal activity determine cognitive performance. Impact on DoD Capabilities: The mathematical models we develop would enable predictions of microbiome, immune, metabolic, vagal and behavioral responses based on quantitative inputs of dietary fat vs. carbohydrate intake and physical stress (oxygen) levels. This could inform cognitive and physiological performance of individuals based on diet and stress.less","6,249,215",2017,2022
0,"Synergistic Software Customization: Framework, Algorithms, Tools",United States Department of the Navy,to Miryung Kim,"Problem: Object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, and Java have brought us software libraries that are large, well tested, and eas""""y to use. As programmers continue to develop layers of useful libraries, the security and efficiency of application software decreas""e. The problem is that the massive libraries usually add complexity to even simple tasks and increase attack surfaces.Objective: Th""e goal of our project is to show how we can address the security and inefficiency problems with novel, automatic software tools. Our"""" tools will remove little used functionality, decrease run-time bloat, and specialize libraries to what is actually used. A unique s""""trength of our project is that we will actively leverage the synergy between the three research thrusts on functionality reduction,"""" de-bloating, and de-layering.Approach:On functionality reduction (FR), our goal is to select features and code regions to be remo""ved from applications and underlying libraries. In order not to require any kinds of human effort in tagging features or functionali""ty, we propose a completely automated approach to detect (1) unused functionality by finding never-invoked APIs or discovering defac""""touse of the interfaces, (2) inefficient objects by determining which faster performing type could replace a slower performing type"""", and (3) redundant program logic evidenced by code duplication in binaries. On de-bloating (DB), our goal is to permanently and sta""tically remove the unnecessary features and code regions. We propose a set of static techniques that merge functionalities of related types with the goal of removing unnecessary types and propose an automated clone removal technique that factorizes redundant code"" in bytecode. On de-layering (DL), our goal is toreduce indirections and layers of abstractions through static inlining and partial"""" evaluation. Our specializationtechnique will remove redundant features, partially evaluate generic code, and change allocation sit""es to use the fastest-performing type. The proposed work builds on the PIs~ foundational work on runtime bloat detection and removal"", code clone analysis and removal, and type-safe inlining. We see tremendous potential for the synergy across the above three resear""ch thrusts. We will design a synergistic approach where the results of one thrust are actively fedto the other two thrusts.

0,Brain Inspired Networks for Multifunctional Intelligent Systems in Aerial Vehicles,United States Air Force,to Yong Chen,"Computers have led to an information revolution and artificial intelligent systems that simulate the learning functions of the human brain. The world’s fastest supercomputer, Summit, may have a computing capacity comparable to that of the human brain. However, Summit consumes the equivalent power of 7000 homes (~15 MW), and the brain only consumes a power of a light bulb (~20 W). Computers execute algorithms on physically separated logic and memory units in digital serial mode, which fundamentally restrains computers from handling “big data” efficiently in complex dynamic environments, and limits the developments of emerging intelligent systems such as self piloted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By contrast, the brain simultaneously processes and learns from “big data” via trillions of synapses and neurons in analog parallel mode, and facilitates parallel processing and real time learning with an energy efficiency more than five orders of magnitude superior to that of the supercomputer. The proposed study intends to perform research on devices including synaptic resistors (synstors), memory resistors (memristors), and neuristors to emulate the analog short and long term memory, convolutional signal processing, and correlative learning functions of synapses, and the nonlinear dynamic functions of neurons.less","4,300,000",2019,2022
0,(MURI-FY22) LEARNING DYNAMICS AND DETECTING CAUSAL PATHWAYS IN COUPLED ONLINE-OFFLINE SYSTEMS,United States Air Force,to P. BRANTINGHAM,"Social instability is increasingly connected to a dynamic interplay between online and offline systems. Such instability is causally complex, multiscale in nature, and is traced to spillover, in both directions, between online and offline domains. Indeed, the complexity of offline and online systems on their own is amplified by the potential that problems or grievances incubated in one domain will spontaneously spread to the other. Threats that arise through coupled online-offline dynamics may reach a critical point faster, jump spatial or community boundaries with little constraint, and thrive on complex beliefs that readily mix fact and fiction. The inherent complexity of coupled online-offline systems motivates our proposed MURI. We will develop new data-driven methods for learning the dynamics of coupled online-offline systems and model-driven approaches for determining when spillover between systems is causally significant. Rapidly detecting patterns and knowing when those patterns are not spurious is central to maintaining agility and readiness in the face of heterogeneous threats.less","4,171,875",2022,2025
0,Adaptive Immersive Training Research,United States Department of the Navy,to Eva L. Baker,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Critical to the Navy is its ability to maintain ships in mission-ready condition at all times. Recognizing and troubleshooting problems on board ship is a crucial skill for technicians, and is essential for a ship’s viability and the safety of its crew. Much of the knowledge and skills required of engineering technicians is to effectively utilize situational and diagnostic cues from the engineering plant to determine potential or actual problems early on, and address them in time before they can escalate to costly and/or dangerous levels. Training to be proficient in such skills requires more than just content understanding and system knowledge, but also necessitates being able to blend this knowledge in hands-on, realworld contexts. A virtualized training environment in which key systems of a ship can be replicated in authentic ways, and in which a student is enabled to interact both physically and cognitively with the system, affords great benefits for training and assessing for engineering related skills/ratings. In such an environment, the student would practice tasks and decisionmaking in authentic, simulated contexts, and be able to use his or her senses to detect abnormal conditions such as excessive heat, unusual sounds, or odors emanating from certain pieces of equipment – all of which could be indicators of problems that can be triaged appropriately and addressed. The National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) proposes to develop an engineering-skills virtual reality test bed. It will combine interface technologies to support advanced sensing modalities (including motion and gesture recognition), advanced feedback modalities (including tactile and olfactory feedback), advanced adaptive training technology, and automated performance assessment capabilities. This proposal outlines the research that we will conduct to examine the effects of multisensory stimuli in an instructional/training setting on learning and performance. This will include looking at adapting task complexity both within and between scenarios, and other supplemental training modules, including perceptual learning modules, and modules on selfmonitoring and creative thinking that focus on troubleshooting.less","3,592,910",2016,2018
0,Extreme Aerodynamics: Grasping the Unknown Skies,United States Department of the Navy,to Kunihiko Taira,"(Approved for Public Release)The goal of the proposed work is to establish a new field of extreme aerodynamics that describes the hi,ghly unsteady nature of turbulent flows around air vehicles in severe weather, urban canyons, and wakes of ships and complex terrain,s.Motivation: Operating air vehicles, especially those that are smaller in size, in highly adverse atmospheric conditions is a major, technological challenge with essentially no available theory. Currently, aircraft avoid operating in such extreme aerodynamic scen,arios, leaving a void in the operational capability. This is due to the fact that traditional aerodynamics are largely based on lin,ear analysis about a steady operating condition with nonlinear extensions for modest levels of perturbations. Understanding flight,in extreme aerodynamic environments calls for innovative perspectives to analyze, model, predict, and control extreme levels of unst,eadiness over lifting bodies. Recent advancements in computational hardware and data-science libraries present a unique opportunity, to develop next-generation aircraft achieving air dominance in extreme weather.Objectives: The ultimate objective here is to establ,ish a novel framework to detect the approach of unknown large-scale perturbations in the atmosphere, determine how such disturbances, affect the dynamics of the aircraft, and perform flow control or maneuvers to achieve stable flight. One of the major challenges i,s that turbulent disturbances in the atmosphere take various forms affecting the vehicle performance in strongly nonlinear manners., If these disturbance dynamics are naively considered, the investigation would require an astronomical number of parametric studies., For these reasons, the study of extreme aerodynamics requires a shift in our scientific perspective from traditional aerodynamics t,o an innovative approach to extracting the dominant extreme response of flying bodies from a massive collection of data. To achieve, the goals of this proposal, we will utilize ultramodern concepts in dynamical systems, network science, and data science. In the p,resent effort, we will (1) numerically simulate extreme aerodynamic model flows with large potential, vortical, and turbulent distur,bances for 2D and 3D wings as well as a tailless UAV model; (2) reveal the universal extreme aerodynamic features through manifold i,dentification using machine learning; (3) model extreme aerodynamics using cluster network analysis and identify key vortical featu,res responsible for transient force generation; (4) assess control effectors for extreme aerodynamic conditions and develop control,techniques based on generalized phased-based and model predictive control; (5) train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in,an interdisciplinary manner to be leading experts in extreme aerodynamics; and (6) disseminate findings through publications, confer,ences presentations, and workshop organizations to form a research community in the field of extreme aerodynamics.Impact on DoD Capa,bilities: A focused research investment for this orchestrated work will establish the theoretical and computational framework for a,new field of extreme aerodynamics and support the designs and operations of next-generation air vehicles in adverse atmospheric cond,itions.

This synergistic approach could be potentially transformative in both the total cooling capacity and the possibility for actively controlling the cooling rate. However, the successful realization of these outcomes will require unraveling numerous unknowns, including thermophysical properties of the oxide across its phase space as well as its thermionic behavior at projected operating conditions.

0,Anion Redox in Amorphous Transition Metal Sulfides,United States Department of the Navy,to Bruce Dunn,"Battery electrode materials are based traditionally on cationic redox processes with 3d transition metals being the most widely investigated. The anions that make up the rest of the material have generally been considered inactive and do not contribute to energystorage. Thus, utilizing redox processes of anions can lead to a potentially large increase in Li-ion battery capacity and energy density, helping to guide the development of next generation Li-ion battery materials. The overarching objective of the research isto use amorphous transition metal sulfides as the basis for obtaining electrode materials which exhibit both cationic and anionic redox. As our initial studies show, amorphous materials benefit from facile bond stretching and overall structural flexibility whichcan be traced to the greater free volume of an amorphous environment. The open architecture of the amorphous system enables the metal-ion coordination to change, which is likely to be a critical feature for the S-S bond breaking and formation processes which are involved in charge storage. To realize this goal, the research will address several fundamental questions regarding amorphous transition metal sulfides. This includes the role of covalency in achieving anion redox, the importance of short-range order in influencing redox reactions and Li-ion diffusion, and identifying compositions which exhibit the highest levels of anion redox. Another objective is to better understand the reasons that amorphous and crystalline transition metal sulfides with the same nominal composition exhibit different redox properties. The proposed research on amorphous transition metal sulfides is intended to be a coordinated program which combines synthesis, electrochemical characterization, synchrotron XAS and computational simulations. By having a critical mass of individual investigators with complementary strengths, we will be able to obtain fundamental understanding of amorphous transition metal sulfides and assess their ability to achieve significantly greater energy density through the combination of anion and cation redox processes. We expect the outcome of this project to not only provide a detailed understanding of anionic redox but also to identify compositions and charge storage mechanisms which lead to high performance battery materials. The potential impact ofthis research on the DoD is that it is directed at identifying new electrochemical materials aimed at improving lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery performance.Approved for Public Releaseless","2,400,000",2023,2027

The state of the art in modeling RF magnetic components is significantly lagging components consisting only electric material with most commercial software being limited to modeling simple, linear material behaviors which are not representative of material response in actual hardware. Moreover, the intrinsic material properties are critically important such as the excitation of the internal spin waves through the exchange of the magnetic domains. These are important mechanisms contributing to power-dependent insertion loss and frequency-selective limitation observed in FSL and SNE. Modeling of such effects in a comprehensive way requires unifying of governing physics from material level in nanometer scales to component level in centimeter scales, where rigorous modeling of such physics spanning six orders of magnitude is impossible even with the fastest supercomputer in the world. In this project, UCLA and UMN researchers team up to attack this grand challenge through development of a multi-physics, multi-scale time-domain solver that can model the seven orders of magnitudes scale difference from nanometers to centimeters, including the physics from electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves to the nonlinear generation of dipole-exchange spin waves into one unified framework. The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to provide a comprehensive and precise modeling solution for nonlinear magnetics. Furthermore, the program focuses on providing a design kit that is physically solid, computationally efficient, and conveniently implementable to commercial simulation software such as ADS. This later is achieved through innovative interpretations of the motions of magnetic spins and their mutual coupling, as well as comprehensive and accurate mathematical representations of the underlying physics.

Limited experimental work is available onlyfor bundles of atomic chains of such 1D vdW materials, suggesting extraordinary electrical current densities and unusual electron-phonon coupling. Computational machine learning studies indicate that there are hundreds of vdW materials with true-1D or quasi-1D crystalline structures consisting of 1D atomic threads weakly bound in bundles. Exfoliated to a few-chain atomic thread, these materials become genuinely quantum: owing to their atomic scale dimensions and atomically sharp interfaces, the electron states are quantumconfined; in addition, many quasi-1D vdW materials are strongly-correlated quantum systems, which reveal non-trivial quantum phenomena, such as charge-density-wave (CDW) condensate phases, magnetic phases, superconductivity, strong spin-orbit coupling, and non-trivial topology. Project goals and objectives: We propose to perform a comprehensive study of 1D quantum materials with the goals of understanding the limits of downscaling of 1D vdW crystals; fine-tuning electron and phonon transport, quasi-particle interactions; and controlling strongly-correlated quantum phenomena in 1D materials. We anticipate discoveries of unique electronic, thermal, and optical properties of 1D quantum materials, resulting from the ultimate quantum confinement of elemental excitations and collective quantum states. We will apply perspectives from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering to provide high-payoff research results. Project objectives include: 1) exfoliating 1D vdW materials down to the ultimate single-atomic chain limit; 2) determining the electrical, thermal, magnetic, and optical characteristics of 1D materials; 3) establishing the electrical control of these characteristics; and 4) understanding and engineering the properties of quantum composites comprised of the polymer matrix and 1D vdWfillers. Innovative technical approaches include nanofabrication of capped and suspended 1D vdW devices to study single quantum phase-slip events; electronic ""noise spectroscopy"" for monitoring CDW and magnetic phase transitions; Brillouin-Mandelstam-Raman spectroscopy of confined elemental excitations; polarization photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons; thermal measurements of heat conduction properties; and electromagnetic testing of dielectric constants of composites with 1D vdWfillers. The experimental research will be supported by the world-class ab-initio theory. Anticipated project outcomes and impact on DoD capabilities: The long-term outcomes of this project will create a foundation for the new class of 1D quantum materials and composites based on such materials withnumerous potential applications to DoD scientific priorities and operational needs. The proposed 1D vdW quantum materials will leadto revolutionary innovations in electronics, sensors, and energy conversion, areas that are of importance to DoD. These materials will impact the DoD capabilities in low-power memory and logic, nanoelectronics, antenna design, and communications, as well as energy conversion and thermal management.

0,Radiation Effects of Brain Inspired Computing Systems,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Subramanian Iyer,"Non-von Neumann computing systems, especially the so-called brain-inspired systems (also called cognitive and neuromorphic systems), have potential to be game changing in computing capability per unit power. The underlying technologies of computer chips have advanced to the point that functional neuromorphic architectures of increasing complexity are being reported; continuing evolution of technologies is expected to expand the practicality and functional levels of neuromorphic architectures. Such computational capability at very low power levels has tremendous potential benefit for DoD applications. A great deal is known about the response of semiconductor technologies (esp. silicon-based) to radiation; somewhat less so for emerging technologies (non-silicon, 2D materials, non-charge based memories, etc.), but in many cases is the subject of ongoing research. However, very little is known about the impact of radiation environments on the robustness of neuromorphic circuit architectures implemented in advanced technologies. This multi-disciplinary project will bring together researchers with expertise in non-conventional computer architecture, device engineering, novel circuit design and radiation effects, and leverage unique access to hardware and simulation capabilities, to advance the understanding of the radiation science of this computing paradigm. Moving forward, novel hardware/circuit specifically designed and optimized for neuromorphic computing are required to unlock the ultra-low power and massively parallel processing power of such brain-inspired systems. Among the many options, novel non-volatile mutlilevel memory elements are essential for the construct of artificial synapses. A novel charge trapped transistors (CTT) and the associated artificial synapse circuit are currently being developed at UCLA in collaboration with GlobalFoundries. In this program, we will examine the radiation effects on these CTT and quantitatively examine the effects of radiation on the neuromorphic computing architecture realized using these novel memory elements.less","1,749,925",2017,2022

State of theart shared autonomy approaches rely on computer vision, motion planning, and teleoperatedcontrol without the consideration of forces. Such control imposes a cognitive burden on theoperator since the consequences of actions cannot be felt. Importantly, a sole reliance on visionbasedcontrol adds risk and slows down missions that require locating, following, and manipulatingcables whose tension must be carefully regulated. The proposed work will use multimodal robotsensing (computer vision, proprioception, tactile sensing), modeling, planning, machine learning,robot controllers, and shared autonomy computer interfaces to reduce the cognitive burden on theremote human operator of EOD robots.The proposed work aims to formalize a collaboration that leverages the expertise of teams led by Prof. Veronica J.

0,ARPIOS: Anthropomorphic Robotic Platform for Intuitive Operation and Service,United States Department of the Navy,to Dennis Hong,"The proposed effort will focus on the research and development of a lightweight, lowcost humanoid platform that is easy to transport, deploy, operate, and maintain. Though there have been a number of efforts to develop a humanoid robot that can be used as a research platform, their use has been very limited outside the laboratories in which they were developed. Their use is limited because these robots are heavy, complex, and difficult to deploy and operate. To promote and accelerate the development of humanoid robotic platforms that can be used in the field, the PI believes that it is critical to maximize the run time of the robots. By deploying and operating the robots in the field as frequently as possible, operators can gain experience with these robots and provide helpful feedback to researchers. For this to happen, it is important to have a low-cost humanoid platform that is easy to transport, handle, deploy and operate. This platform, however, would also need to be able to perform some useful tasks and be upgradeable and expandable to use the latest component technologies. Based on our extensive experience in developing and using humanoid robots, we propose to develop a new class of humanoid robot called ARPIOS (Anthropomorphic Robotic Platform for Intuitive Operation and Service). The key focus of ARPIOS is to make it as easy as possible to transport, deploy, operate, and maintain so people can easily and effectively use it for useful tasks in the field. By utilizing interchangeable revolute modular series elastic actuators (SEAs) and a simple mechanical structure, ARPIOS will be very lightweight (85 lb estimated) and easy to deploy and maintain. ARPIOS will be very easy to operate using a user-friendly human-machine interface, requiring minimal training to use. Smart design features such as mechanically lockable joints, integrated caster wheels, and multi-point support handles will all make handling and transporting the robot significantly easier. ARPIOS will be developed in multiple stages and the capabilities of each version of ARPIOS will be demonstrated with a series of scheduled demos. This will allow us to showcase the progress of the ARPIOS project and use ARPIOS in the field during the early stages of the project. We strive for ARPIOS to serve as a general research platform to further push research for state of the art humanoid robotics.less","1,599,079",2016,2017

0,Research for Innovative Technology: The Navy Life Game,United States Department of the Navy,to Eva Baker,"The Navy is continually faced with a need to improve the quality and efficiency of recruitment and retention. However, to accomplish"""" this the Navy must manage the expectations and interests of potential new recruits (e.g., Sailors 2025). Specifically, the Naval Pe""rsonnel Command (N1) recognizes that many recruits make decisions to enlist in the Navy and choose specific job ratings without understanding the specific jobs and the duties associated with these jobs. They are often also unaware of the required schooling required or the performance expectations. This partial understanding of Navy life and shipboard operations and responsibilities affects how potential recruits match their interests and abilities to possible ratings. Without a clearer view of job options and the associate""d expectations, the Navy risks creating recruit dissatisfaction which leads in many cases to attrition and additional costs to the N""""avy. As the Navy provides more sophisticated technologies on board its ships, they will also require more recruits who are both read""y to learn and adapt to the changing job environments. This proposal conducts research on an approach to improve the match between"" recruit knowledge and interests and Navy career paths to avoid attrition in basic training, A-Schools, and C-Schools. In cooperatio""""n with ONR and N1, CRESST proposes an effort to conduct research on a family of Navy Life Games, whose objectives are to improve Nav""""y recruitment, selection, and classification, and to reduce attrition using a combination embedding JOIN technology with game techno""""logy. The overall effort will have two strands. In Strand 1, ONR S&T will reduce the risk of this family of games. In Strand 2, a se""""t of nonproprietary games will be designed, developed, and evaluated that can be tailored and used for recruitment, selection, class""""ification, and training. This suite of games will be a core game with modules (APS) adjusted to changing Navy needs and capability."" This proposal is focused on Strand 1: ONR S&T. There are four interacting research themes: (1) design a systems architecture to sup""port a family of Navy Life games and (2) design and create a Navy Life Game Research preprototype, based on (3) simulated trainee re""""search, and improved by (4) research on innovative psychometric computational models. The preprototype will be based on agent-base""""d models of simulated trainees~each with specific, numerically-represented person characteristics depicting various cognitive and af""""fective constructs (such as interest, motivation, persistence). These simulated trainee models will be developed and refined, and us""""ed to generate distributions of game-play performance and behaviors that represent the population of interest (i.e., potential new r""ecruits). This approach to modeling and simulating the interaction of player traits with game-based experiences will dramatically re""duce the need for early human data collection, and promote the discovery of shortcomings early in the design process, well before an""y human testing is required. The preprototype will serve as a game model for a human-playable game aimed at determining the suitability of a person (based on their aptitudes and interests) to the various enlisted ratings and fields that exist in the Navy.

0,Flow Physics and Distillation of the Gust-Induced Stall of a Low Aspect Ratio Wing,United States Air Force,to Jeffrey Eldredge,"A three-year program is proposed to investigate, classify and develop tools for the estimation of forceson low aspect ratio wings during gust encounters. The performance of lightweight next-generationaircraft is more strongly affected by incident gusts than their larger and heavier antecedents, andparticularly by large amplitude gusts that induce stall. Progress in this area has been impeded by thelack of a canonical gust structure (e.g. vertical jet, vortex, oscillating free stream) that encompasses asufficiently wide range of operating conditions and is achievable in both experimental facilities and incomputational frameworks. Through a joint experimental, computational and theoretical investigation,the proposed research program aims to develop a new taxonomy of gusts based primarily on theaerodynamic response they induce rather than on their original structure. By classifying in this fashion,gusts of different nominal structure but similar response would be directly comparable across a diversespectrum of facilities. A novel gust wind tunnel facility will be developed and used to build a database ofgust flow responses. State-of-the-art pattern recognition algorithms from machine learning will betrained on these data, as well as those from high-fidelity computational and low-order vortex-modelingstudies, to classify gusts based on pre-chosen criteria, to estimate their force response, and to proposenew classifications from the features detected in, for example, their surface measurements. Tools fromcontrol theory will be used to compute optimal worst-case gusts from among the identified classes.Experiments will explore the effectiveness of two different forms of actuation for controlling the wingresponse.

To achieve the goals outlined in this project, we will explore emerging data-driven techniques in machine learning to 1) extract dominant patterns from high-dimensional fluid flow data, 2) robustly sense and estimate the flow from limited measurements, 3) develop reduced-order models for the flows, and 4) design controllers to modify the behavior of the flow. This work relies on the observation that even complex, unsteady flows exhibit large-scale coherent patterns that may facilitate efficient modeling, estimation, and control. The sharp acceleration experienced by the aerodynamic body generates vorticity along its surface that forms into large coherent vortical structures. Characterizing, modeling, and controlling these patterns may be formulated as high-dimensional, nonconvex optimization problems. For solving such problems, emerging techniques in machine learning provide a powerful approach for generalizations of existing linear modeling (e.g., POD-DMD) and control (e.g., LQR-LQG) techniques. The adaptive control techniques developed from the proposed efforts will be tested on progressively complex unsteady fluid flows. We in particular will consider two- and three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows over airfoil in unsteady maneuver or under the influence of gust. Advanced flow control using these techniques will enable practical engineering goals including lift increase, drag reduction, and stable flight, which are critical to improve performance and efficiency in various aerospace applications.

The structural propert,ies of thin film substrates formed using subtractive manufacturing techniques allows for strong, lightweight, and easily transportab,le structures with a wide range of geometries difficult to achieve otherwise. Meanwhile, the simplicity and availability of the plan,ar materials allows for rapid prototyping and fabrication, which can be coupled with fundamental geometric theory to enable the comp,utational design and manufacturing of prescribed structures.Unfortunately, those two capabilities are often at odds. The theory unde,rlying the design of deployable structures requires strong restrictions on allowable geometric operations--typically assuming rigid,faces or beams attached along single degree-of-freedom folds or pivots. Meanwhile, unique mechanical advantages of the 2D substrates, such as compliance, curvature, and controlled deformation can only be exploited through custom expert-driven heuristic design.We ai,m to rectify this shortcoming, leading to well grounded advances that unlock the ability to transition deployable technologies to ac,tual users outside the research lab.

These platforms are becoming very mobile and robust, and can be equipped with sensors for inspection and patrol. However, as impressive as they are, none of theserobots were designed specifically for the shipboard environment where the environment it needs to navigate is unique, tasks it needs to perform are special, and the requirements it needs to satisfy are different.To explore the capabilities of quadruped technology, RoMeLa developed the highly successful ALPHRED-2, a multi-modal quadruped robot featuring RoMeLas own proprioceptive BEAR modules and a unique limb configuration that allowed it to also perform certain manipulation tasks such as package delivery. ALPHRED-2 can walk with 4 legs, 2 legs, run very fast (up to 1.5 m/s),roll, hop, jump (up to about 1 m), and even use its legs as arms for picking up simple objects or pushing buttons. However, being a research prototype for investigation, it is not robust enough to be used in the real environment and more research and development is needed to address its many issues as well. Nonetheless, to develop a very realistic and useful robot for the unique shipboardenvironment, we believe ALPHRED-2 is the perfect platform to start with.The next quadruped RoMeLa would like to develop is called the Shipboard Operations Robot with Enhanced Legged Locomotion (SORELL): a quadruped that shares the configuration and core mobility platform of ALPHRED-2 but features many design improvements for robustness and to further extend its capabilities. The main design addition will be a pair of small, precise manipulator arms located at the top of the body dedicated to performing meticulous interaction tasks.Additional iterative improvements include updating the leg transmission design, increasing the torque output of the equipped BEAR modules, refining the body structure and liquid cooling setup, and designing end-effector tools for the main limbs. These improvements would allow SORELL to move large objects with its main limbs, or precisely interact with small console buttons and keyboards with its arms, while keeping ALPHRED-2s mobility capabilities which will allow it totraverse over knee-knockers or navigate tight and narrow hallways found on ships with the potential to climb up stairs. Furthermore, the body updates would allow for SORELL to invert itself, moving the arms to the underside the body and creating an entirely new workspace directly beneath the robot which would be ideal for precisely manipulating objects on the floor such as defusing bombs via teleoperation. Crucially, these additional features can be developed on arelatively short timeline (3 years) due to the fact that the design and control of the core quadruped platform has already been validated on ALPHRED-2.With its unique mobility and manipulation capabilities, we believe SORELL will become the ideal robotic platform for the shipboard environment.less","985,028",2020,2023
0,Buffer Layer Mediated van der Waals Integration of Contacts and Dielectrics on Two-Dimensional Semic,United States Department of the Navy,to Xiangfeng Duan,"Two-dimensional semiconductors (2DSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as an atomically thin channel for the continued transistor, scaling. To construct a functional transistor from the 2DSCs requires the integration of the 2DSCs with other critical device compo,nents, including source-drain electrodes, gate dielectrics and gate electrode, with minimum damage to the atomic lattice and electro,nic structure of the 2DSCs, which is a non-trivial challenge. Conventional electronic manufacturing, including lithography, vacuum d,eposition, and plasma etching processes, usually involve aggressive chemical processes that induce undesired structural disorders in, 2DSCs and seriously degrade their electronic properties. To robustly probe the performance limits of 2DSCs and capture their intrin,sic merits in functional devices face considerable challenges in material integration and device fabrication. In particular, it is e,ssential to retain the pristine contact interfaces and dielectric interfaces with minimum interfacial trapping states.This project a,ims to exploit a removable buffer layer on 2DSCs to prevent direct impingement by hot atoms during physical vapor deposition of meta,l electrodes. Once the deposition is completed, the buffer layer is vaporized at a moderate temperature, allowing the deposited meta,l thin film electrodes to naturally relax onto the 2DSC surface to form bond-free and defect-free VDW interfaces. We will explore a,series of buffer layers and conduct systematic structural and spectroscopic studies to investigate how the exact buffer layer, proce,ssing temperature and pressure could mitigate the deposition induced damage. We will further use the proposed approach to integrate,a series of metals of different work functions on 2DSCs, conducting fundamental transport studies to determine barrier height, Fermi, level pinning effect and Schottky-Mott rule. We will further adapt this approach for damage-free integration of high-k dielectric o,n 2DSCs with minimum interfacial trapping states. With the optimization of contact and dielectric interface, we will further constru,ct 2DSC transistors with variable channel lengths to systematically probe the contact resistance, on-state current density, mobility, and subthreshold swing, and investigate how such performance metrics depend on the integration process and scale with channel lengt,h, channel thickness and dielectric thickness.The proposed studies address the fundamental technical challenges in integrating 2DSCs, in high-performance devices, and represent the essential steps for pushing and probing the fundamental performance limits of 2D tra,nsistors. A close integration of the microstructural imaging, spectroscopic characterizations and capacitance and electrical transpo,rt studies will help develop a fundamental understanding of the critical factors governing the contact barrier, contact resistance,,carrier densi,ltaneously optimized contact and dielectric interfaces are essential for probing the ultimate scaling limit of 2DSCs and critically,gauging their potential for the continued transistor scaling down to sub-10 nm channel length regime. Successful execution of the pr,oposed effort will define a new pathway to high performance 2D electronics and establish the intellectual underpinning for adopting,them in semiconductor industry. It could open up many exciting opportunities in 2DSC-based electronic devices for various naval appl,ications, including low-power electronics, advanced military imaging technology, novel sensors for chemical warfare detection.?Appro,ved for Public Release?less","950,000",2022,2025
0,Spin Biology under Optimal Quantum Control,United States Department of the Navy,to Clarice Aiello,"@@@ht underlie many relevant biological processes, from exquisite magnetic field detection for animal navigation, to metabolic regulation in cells and optimal electron transport in chiral biomolecules. Spin measures how some quantum objects (e.g., electron, atomic nuclei) interact with, and react to, magnetic fields. Importantly, and even if pioneering studies were developed in the context of magnetoreception (MR) for organismal navigation (such as birds, butterflies and turtles), many physiologically relevant chemical reactions are known to be magnetic field-dependent via spin degrees of freedom. Such biological magnetosensing (MS) phenomena have seldomly been investigated in vivo and at the nanoscale.The fact that a truly quantum mechanism could provide an essential benefit to life processes is an astonishing hypothesis, as it suggests that organisms are, at least for a short time, behaving as living quantum sensors. Astoundingly, these quantum sensors appear to even surpass humankind-made devices, despite being embedded in a noisy, hot and wet biological environment, rather than a shielded cryostat at near-zero temperature. This indicates that, not only could establic probes that mimic living quantum sensors, and the harnessing of quantum degrees of freedom to commandeer and drive physiology.This proposal aims to utilize tools from the coherent control of open quantum systems to, for the first time, realize the latter prospect at the nanoscale. In particular, we will develop instruments in which external electromagnetic stimulation will purposefully influence, and eventually control, spin in biological reaction processes. This will allow us to overcome a current dilemma of the field known as quantum biology: traditional approaches at disjoint length scales (experiments with proteins in solution accompanied by experiments with whole organisms) make it difficult, if not impossible, to unambiguously link these quantum processes to specific physiological reactions. Current experiments do not address important details (for ex., which spins species are involved and how they cope with environmental noise) neither are designed to provide systematic knowledge. Conversely, and by design, our approach is to utilize spin as a tool in biology and medicine by developing electromagnetic handles on in vivo biological spin processes at the nanoscale under a Total Internal Reflection Microscope, thereby bridging the length scale gap and providing some much needed systematization.With systematized knowledge of spin effects at the nanoscale, selective stimulation or suppression of cellular functions that respond to electromagnetic fields is possible. For example, magnetic field and radiofrequency excitation could be applied in vivo and, in principle, via remote instructions, so as to reduce uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) proliferation (a hallmark of metabolic and degenerative diseases as well as reperfusion injury); or enhance it (to boost immune responses, locally or on the entire organism); besides, electron signaling through proteins could be made pathologically weak or strong by molecular design. In order words, our long-term goal is thus to master organismic behavior and metabolic function via the control of electromagnetic-responsive pathways (both endogenous and bioengineered), using the sensitivity of spin-tailored electromagnetic field excitation.We focus this project on questions whose answers are ambiguous given current instrumentation. Our high-tech experiments will unequivocally confirm or refute, systematize, and eventually control biological spin pathways using electromagnetic radiation.less","948,953",2020,2023

0,NOVA - A Neuro-Symbolic Vision-Language Framework for Multimodal Human-Machine Interactions,United States Department of the Navy,to Kai Wei Chang,"When humans perform a task, they make sense of the world through visual and language descriptions, conduct logical and commonsense reasoning, understand and execute instructions, and proactively request clarification when they are uncertain. Inspired by this, we propose NoVa, a Neuro-symbolic Vision-language (VL) framework that enables an AI agent to recognize new concepts and perform complextasks through multimodal interactions with humans in a reliable way. NoVa integrates three innovations: 1) object-level VL grounding that makes sense of perceptual visual inputs at different semantic levels, from low-level object attributes to high-level properties such as affordance and functionality; 2) neuro-symbolic learning that combine neural networks and symbolic rules to conduct probabilistic reasoning during training and inference phases 3) uncertainty estimation to measure the confidence of the model predictions. The final system integrates all the aforementioned components and enablesan AI agent to learn from few-shot examples and associated language descriptions. The developed techniques will be tested on various real-world tasks involving rare objects and new concepts including object detection, multimodal information extraction, and visual question answering. If successful, NoVA will make a transformative impact in reducing data collection efforts for training AI agents. This is especially important for DoD applications, where new objects, scenes, and targets are frequently encountered. In such cases, acquiring large-scale annotated data with consistent annotated labels is tedious and often impossible. In contrast, NoVa will enable a human-machine teaming framework, where domain experts such as naval officers can directly teach AI agents through examples, instructions, and describing objects, events, and semantic roles in human language. The capability can be used as a tool for pervasive, wide-area visual surveillance for military bases andreal-time intelligence information collection to facilitate command decision-making. Since human-assisted monitoring is costly and often unreliable, systems that can reduce human involvement and improve reliability are of interest.Approved for Public Releaseless","899,997",2023,2026

0,DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING SUB-NANO CATALYSTS FOR ENDOTHERMIC COOLING,United States Air Force,to ANASTASSIA ALEXANDROVA,"The goals and objectives of the proposed research are in the area of endothermic fuel reactions, with application to powered hypersonic flight. The work is motivated by the need to selectively catalyze endothermic reactions in fuels, thus enhancing the fuel cooling capacity, while minimizing formation of carbon deposits (coking), which tend to clog fuel passages, leading to system failure. We will focus on catalysts consisting of sub-nano clusters deposited on oxide supports as highly active, and metals efficient catalysts. Specifically, we will investigate tuning the activity, selectivity, and thermal stability of the catalysts by size-selection, alloying of the clusters, and doping the support. All these factors have been shown to affect the electronic and geometric structure of the catalyst clusters, changing the energetics for reactions, and anchoring the clusters to the support. Understanding how to optimize these multi-component catalysts requires tightly coupled, and mutually reinforcing theory and experiments, to predict, prepare, and study well-defined cluster catalysts. The PIs have developed many tools and methods required for this purpose. The experiments will take advantage of a new DURIP-funded microreactor capability what will allow cluster catalysis to be studied at high pressures and high temperatures. The theory includes unique methods developed under previous AFOSR grants to describe fluxional cluster catalysts as statistical ensembles of isomers, leading to a new paradigm in catalyst description and design. Theory extensively uses the DoD HPC resources. One of the objectives for this work is to develop new knowledge about the detailed mechanisms of reactions at high temperatures and reactant loadings (i.e., high pressures), including the effects of thermal and adsorbate-driven evolution of the catalysts. Another objective is to develop new approaches to understanding catalyst deactivation by coking, sintering, or other catalyst particle morphological changes, and how to prevent it. Achievement of these objectives will enable development of new catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for endothermic fuel cooling. Finally, the methods and design principles emerging from this work will be significant in a broader range of catalytic applications, including processes of interest for synthetic fuel production such as steam reforming and Fischer –Tropsch synthesis.less","807,702",2022,2025
0,Fusing model-based and function-based approaches to AI,United States Department of the Navy,to Adnan Darwiche,"This project is based on a distinction between model-based and function-based approaches to artificial intelligence (AI), with a further distinction between symbolic and probabilistic model-based approaches. The main insight is that the field of AI has focused on different approaches during different phases of its history, and by largely disjoint communities, even though each approach has much to offer yet comes with limitations. The PI???s Automated ReasoningGroup at UCLA has been somewhat unique in having made significant contributions to both symbolic and probabilistic model-based approaches, particularly as far as integrating such approaches. Moreover, it has pioneered work on compiling models into tractable circuits, which can be viewed as a class of functions; in line with the current function based approaches realized by neural networks and deep learning. This project will capitalize on theseaccomplishments and associated expertise for the goal of fusing model-based and function-based approaches, using new insights and innovative research directions. In particular, we plan to capture domain knowledge using partialmodels, that integrate logical constraints, uncertainty, independence and causality. This will allow us to utilize both symbolic and probabilistic model-based approaches for the purpose of capturing the (partial) knowledge we may have about a domain. We then plan to synthesize a function structure from a partial model, while directing the function towards a specific query, as in neural networks. We will finally train the synthesized function structure using labeled and unlabelled data, in a style similar to, but that extends deep learning approaches to combine supervised and unsupervised learning.less","800,000",2018,2022

Generalization means that the trained DNN performs effectively on relevant data outside the training set. Generalization as currently understood, is not mathematically tractable, since it involves a combination of data, network architecture, and regularization, along with training methods. Our approach facilitates generalization by widening the local minima at various scales via PDE methods, in particular the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation.

0,An Optimized Qubit for the Next Generation of Quantum Information Processing,National Security Agency,to Wesley Campbell,"While progress continues toward increasingly sophisticated and larger-scale trapped ion quantum information processing (QIP), the substantial difficulty of working with the available trapped ion species is becoming more apparent. These ions suffer from one or (typically) more of the following atomic-species-specific impediments to scaling up the fidelity and system size: qubit initialization that is either poor-quality or too slow, qubit readout that is either poor-quality or too slow, coherence times during operation that are too short, dark states whose repumping is too slow, and a lack of high-quality photonics hardware at operational wavelengths. We propose to build upon our recent breakthough in trapping and cooling the synthetic radioisotope 133Ba+ to demonstrate that working with this species will not only dramatically simplify the trapped ion quantum information processor, but will enable progress through its suite of robust hyperfine and optical qubits that couple to visible, fiber-friendly light. We will begin by improving our loading methods to allow working with this species without cumbersome overhead associated with its radioactivity. We will demonstrate a complete set of QIP tasks using a clock-state qubit defined on an optical transition (an ""optical-frequency qubit""), including a two-qubit entangling gate. This effort will be centered on a 1762 nm laser system we will build in successively-narrower-linewidth stages, demonstrating increasingly precise operations as the laser linewidth continues to improve. We will demonstrate state preparation and state detection using the laser-cooling lasers, and a complete set of QIP gates on the optical-frequency qubit using the narrow-linewidth laser.

The proposed facility would allow for the fabrication of advanced mechanical designs and rapid prototyping to continue RoMeLa’s cutting edge research and development in robotics. RoMeLa has been at the forefront of humanoid robotics for the past decade. Many of RoMeLa’s past robotic projects have been recipients of Department of Defense (DoD) funding, resulting in successful, high impact robots such as THOR and THOR-OP, humanoid robots designed to provide aid in disaster relief situations. THOR-OP placed in the top 8 in the first round of the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) and won “Best in Task” for the valve task. Both THOR and THOR-OP will compete in the finals of the DRC in June of 2015. Also developed at RoMeLa, the autonomous vehicle Odin from Team Victor Tango was an autonomously driven SUV that placed third in the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007. DARwIn-OP is a small humanoid robot which is now an immensely popular platform for research and education. DARwIn-OP is also the World Champion in the international autonomous robot soccer competition, RoboCup kid size division four years in a row. CHARLI is considered the United States first adult size humanoid robot, which lead to the development of SAFFiR a humanoid robot for fire fighting on navy ships, sponsored by ONR. All of these past robots were designed and fabricated when RoMeLa was at Virginia Tech. RoMeLa has since moved to UCLA and is in the process of reestablishing the lab space. We have the same creative minds (under the leadership of the PI, Dr. Dennis Hong), the same enthusiasm, the same expertise, and the same exciting projects and ongoing research. In order to continue producing the innovative robotic creations that RoMeLa is known for, we need to accrue similar resources that RoMeLa acquired at Virginia Tech. Currently the lab is working on new and exciting projects which include; ARPIOS, a high functioning lightweight humanoid robot; a new version of THOR-OP, a humanoid robot competing in the DARPA Robotics Challenge finals; and a hexapod robot for demining and ordinance removal applications.

0,Modeling atomically dispersed metals on oxides as catalysts for oxidative decomposition of chemical warfare agents,United States Department of the Army,to Philippe Sautet,"Facile decomposition and neutralization of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) under ambient conditions is a major challenge in the modern world. Recent events demonstrate that there is an unmet need to better protect soldiers using personal protective ensembles that neutralize or destroy CWAs under ambient conditions. To achieve the goal of efficient CWA destruction under ambient conditions, new highly efficient catalysts are required. We propose to develop, from ab initio modeling, principles for designing new materials comprised of highly dispersed metal atoms, including single atoms, supported on metal oxides as catalysts for efficient oxidative decomposition of CWAs under ambient conditions. This proposed modeling has the potential for design of catalysts with high reactivity under moderate, ambient conditions by exploiting the high reactivity of open coordination sites on highly dispersed metal centers. The proposed research will address several key questions: ¥ What combination of metal oxides and metals yield stable highly dispersed metals centers in ambient conditions? What is the equilibrium oxidation state of theses highly dispersed metal centers? What are the underlying factors that determine stability? ¥ Which of these materials are computationally predicted to be most effective for oxidative decomposition of CWAs (sarin and mustard) and their simulants (Dimethyl methylphosphonate, DMMP and 2-Chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) and what is the mechanism and the kinetics for this decomposition, including the possible role of reactive peroxo species formed from O2? ¥ Can products be removed from the active site and stored on the oxide support? Or is there a threat that the active site is contaminated by the products? ¥ How do other gases in the environment, as water, affect the structure of the highly dispersed metal center and their efficiency for the catalytic oxidative decomposition? Density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used to investigate the structure of highly dispersed metal sites, their oxidation state in ambient conditions, their stability against sintering and their reactivity for oxidation of CWAs (sarin and mustard) and their simulants (DMMP and CEES). The calculations will be performed with the VASP code Total energies will be combined with a thermodynamic treatment in order to assess the stability of various catalyst structures in reaction conditions. The exploration of geometric configuration will be performed manually for small catalytic species, but will use automated global optimization techniques for larger ones. Reaction pathways will be determined using a combination of nudged elastic band and dimer methods. DFT studies enable to rapidly screen for candidate materials that can then be tested experimentally. This approach will yield design principles for predicting stability and reactivity of catalysts. Simulants will be considered to facilitate the interaction with Virginia Tech. DFT will be used to also model actual CWAs to understand their reactivity, and to assess how well simulant used in academic experimental studies can predict CWA behavior. Experimental studies of CWAs on model materials will be performed in collaboration with researchers at Chemical and Biological Center (CBC) to further benchmark the theory. The longer-term goal of this work is to use the understanding gained from the modelling to design active and cost-effective catalysts for efficient CWA decomposition that can be incorporated into protective equipment.less","769,235",2021,2024
0,Mindful Self-Compassion for Co-occurring PTSD/SUD in Trauma-Exposed Women Experiencing Homelessness,United States Department of the Army,to Dana Garfin,"Trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorder (SUD) present major threats to public health. PTSD and SUD are major correlates of disability, often resulting in severe social and occupational impairment. Comorbidity between PTSD and SUD (PTSD/SUD) is common and frequently co-occurs with other mental health ailments including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Comorbidity may be amplified in groups vulnerable to high trauma exposure, such as women with low socioeconomic status including women experiencing homelessness (WEH). Moreover, the reciprocal nature of PTSD/SUD (substances are used to cope with PTSD symptoms; substance use can create high-risk situations for new traumas to occur) can create a cycle of trauma and symptomatology leading to a critical health disparity. PTSD/SUD can be costly and difficult to treat, with treatment completion often low and relapse rates often high. Low-cost, complementary interventions, such as self-compassion (SC) interventions, which target key mechanisms that maintain PTSD/SUD, could improve treatment outcomes. SC interventions include practices that build skills to improve emotional responses, cognitive understanding, and mindfulness. Recent research supports the benefit of SC interventions for reducing PTSD, SUD, and related comorbidities, potentially with large effects. However, sample sizes have generally been small and randomized designs infrequently used. Moreover, while SC interventions may act to improve key mechanisms of treatment response and/or symptom maintenance (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, trauma-related guilt, trauma-related shame, moral injury, and craving), such mediating factors have been underexplored. To address these limitations, the present proposal will implement community-based research principles and use a two phase, mixed-method design to adapt and test a widely used SC intervention (Mindful Self Compassion; MSC) for use with a sample of WEH with PTSD/SUD. The project will be conducted in partnership with a state-funded drug treatment facility that serves women and families experiencing high health disparities. Phase I will adapt the standard MSC course for use with trauma-exposed WEH with PTSD/SUD using the ADAPT-ITT model, an eight-stage model that engages community partners to increase feasibility and acceptability of interventions for at-risk populations. A community advisory board will design a semi structured interview guide for use in focus group sessions (N=4 focus groups, 28 WEH total) to gain feedback that will inform intervention adaptation. Phase II will be an open-label cluster randomized clinical trial (N=202) to test the benefit of the adapted MSC at improving primary (PTSD, substance use) and secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety, suicidality) among a sample of WEH with PTSD/SUD residing in a residential drug treatment site. MSC (n=101) will be compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU; n=101). WEH in the MSC group will complete a 6-week (six sessions plus a half-day retreat) MSC intervention. The TAU group will engage in weekly check-ins with the research team but will not receive an intervention. WEH will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at a 4-month follow-up. One-on-one interviews will be conducted with the MSC group to collect qualitative data on experiences. An exploratory aim will be to elucidate mechanism of treatment-response and maintenance or remission of PTSD symptoms. These potential mechanisms will include SC, emotion regulation/dysregulation, trauma-related guilt, trauma-related shame, moral injury, and craving. Results may inform treatment for PTSD/SUD in WEH and other groups experiencing high health disparities and provide valuable insights into mechanisms underlying PTSD/SUD symptoms over time. Findings are relevant to military populations, which experience high rates of PTSD/SUD, and other populations disproportionately exposed to trauma.less","768,344",2023,2026
0,Charge Storage and Ion Transport in Non-Crystalline Materials,United States Department of the Navy,to Bruce Dunn,"ABSTRACT: The studies described in this proposal concern the synthesis and properties of new electrochemical materials which are designed to possess specific properties that address limitations in lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery performance and capabilities. Three separate research topics are considered. The research on high rate electrode materials is directed at the limitation in obtaining electrode materials which retain high energy density at high charge/discharge rates. The research will focus on amorphous materials as initial results with amorphous VO2 indicate that the Na+ insertion properties of this material reach the high discharge rate properties comparable to those obtained for high rate Li+ insertion materials. The second topic involves research on anion redox processes. This project is directed at anotherlimitation; the low energy density of positive electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries as the prospect of adding anion redox processes to traditional cation redox will lead to an increase in the total amount of charge storage. These studies will focus on amorphous polysulfide systems whose covalency and band structure are expected to lead to more stable anion redox processes.The third area of investigation concerns the multifunctionality of polymer electrolytes. The objective here is to create polymer electrolytes that exhibit ionic conduction and can also be photo-patterned. The principal objective of the research is to greatly improve the ionic conductivity of the polymer without compromising its photo-patterning properties.

0,Quantum-assisted molecular technology,United States Department of the Army,to Eric Hudson,"This project is working to demonstrate entanglement between trapped polar molecular ions, which is the necessary, but so far missing, ingredient for constructing quantum-assisted technology based on polar molecules. While there has been much work on controlling neutral polar molecules, polar molecular ions have somewhat been neglected by the mainstream cold molecule community. This is because it was commonly assumed that the details of ion trapping prevented use of the dipole-dipole interaction to generate entanglement between trapped molecular ions. However, we have recently shown this is not true and, in fact, a full host of applications for polar molecules is available to molecular ions.

The first is a catalog of molecular predictors of cognitive fatigue present in saliva. This catalog will facilitate construction of smartphone-type devices that allow small saliva draws to be analyzed for inflight assessment of cognitive function. The second is a biochemical map describing how communications among body tissues change as fatigue sets in. Understanding these changes will enable development of training programsthat enhance pilot cognitive endurance.The PI's team’s unique experience and technology capabilities will enable these deliverables to be realized via analysis of exosomes, nanometer-sized vesicles produced by all body cells, in saliva. Whereas saliva is a complex mixture from which low abundance, yet highly important, cell-to-cell communication molecules are difficult to isolate, exosomes are distinct carriers of such molecules; enriching salivary exosomes allows one to accurately measure how levels of these molecules change as cognitive function declines. Making an expansive and integrated set of such measurements will allow project key deliverables to be realized and enable development of both smartphone-type cockpit devices for forewarning cognitive fatigue and training programs that improve pilot endurance.less","758,287",2017,2020
0,Option 2: Address a Major Challenge in Silicon Quantum Dot Qubits,National Security Agency,to HongWen Jiang,"The inability to perform read-out in a majority of Si MOS and Si/SiGe spin qubit devices presents one of the biggest challenges to the Si qubit research community. In this experimental program, we propose to improve the outlook of the spin-read-out in two different areas. First, given the small valley splitting in an overwhelmingly large number of SiGe QD devices, we will conduct a sequence of coherent manipulation experiments on a series of highly-tunable and well-characterized Si/SiGe QD devices to develop advanced read-out schemes. The small valley-splitting tolerant methods will use specially-designed pulses and exploit the valley-parity effect. In addition, accumulation mode QD devices with designs similar to those used by other major experimental groups will be fabricated to test the small-valley-splitting tolerant methods so that results obtained here can be compared with other results. Second, an e-beam-less nanofabrication process will be developed to reduce charge impurities in the proximity of Si MOS QDs to a level comparable to that of epitaxial heterostrucures, while preserving the basic device structure of Si MOS, thus avoiding the read-out difficulty produced by parasitic dots. The project is completely in line with the call for option 2 proposals and is based upon the accumulated experience of the group in both Si MOS and Si/SiGe QDS fabrication and characterization. If a major portion of the concentrated effort is successful, it will qualitatively improve the yield and fidelity of the spin-based Si qubits as well as make the implementation of a multiple-qubit system more practical.less","752,752",2017,2020

PowerMEMS believes that wireless technology is revolutionizing the industrial instrumentation world, but the idea of periodically replacing batteries in thousands of wireless device is unacceptable. Therefore, the key to developing a fully automated wireless based sensor network is providing remote power. To address this, PowerMEMS proposes a novel thermal energy harvesting system based on active materials. We propose using a mechanically coupled thin film ferromagnetic alloy with a thin film piezoelectric material along with new thermal interface materials. By combining these materials in a novel fashion, provides a unique device potentially producing larger power densities than currently available. BENEFIT: During the last decade there has been significant growth in low-power wireless sensor network systems (WSN) for applications such as aircraft health monitoring, petroleum screening, and bioterrorism evaluation.  All of these applications represent important issues to national defense and thus to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  While WSN systems are becoming prevalent throughout our society, the major remaining obstacle is providing remote energy, i.e. energy harvesting.  While conventional wireless systems include cell phones and laptops, future wireless systems are orders of magnitude smaller and more ubiquitous than current systems, providing detailed and site specific information on complex systems (e.g. aircraft engines). However, the idea of periodically replacing batteries in thousands of wireless devices throughout a defense or industrial complex is unacceptable and in many applications (i.e. jet engine health monitoring) impossible.

This proposal seeks to address long-standing challenges in real-time 4D (3D+time) adaptive laser pulse-shaping to control atmospheric interactions and adjust to rapidly-changing conditions for ultrashort and high-intensity laser pulses. To meet our objectives, we will incorporate emerging interferometric techniques beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) relying on ultralow-noise phase control to perform multi-modal detection for (i) quantum atmospheric sensing, such as remote aerosol, gas, and metal-metalloid species sensing as well as larger particulates affecting climate variables; (ii) accurately determining the level and dynamical behavior of (deep) turbulence beyond Rytov and Reynold approximations; and (iii) gaining computationally-intelligent situational awareness and predictive capabilities to overcome or compensate for atmospheric turbulence channels, such as scintillation and diffraction, scattering, thermal blooming, and (self-)lensing. Our methods will rely on novel optical frequency comb laser beam synthesis based on correlated photon diversity to generate laser beams with customized and non-conventional spatio-temporal properties and integrated quantum sensing capabilities that leverage artificial neural networks to critically estimate the performance of future high-energy directed energy and intelligently steer, push and pull, or nudge targets using complex multi-dimensional photon-pressure gradients in maritime environments. Our technical approach leverages key fundamental demonstrations in structured photonic architectures, adaptive optics, ultraprecise phase-stabilization, quantum optics and sensing, and emerging machine-learning and reverse engineering methods with a track record of real-world applications beyond academic research in US National Laboratory and Industrial complexes. Atmospheric sensing and predictive adaptive beam stewardship are essential for the U.S. Navy, security and defense, and the economy as it provides the ability to detect, monitor, and predict the behavior of environmental conditions, such as weather, ocean currents, and air quality. By leveraging predictive ability, intelligent adaptive laser synthesis allows faster beam shaping and more accurate scanning, targeting, and removal of security vulnerabilities. This information can be used to inform decisions about ship movements, fleet operations, and surveillance activities, and to improve the safety andefficiency of operations. Extending the physical limits of sensing to measure and analyze complex datasets from the environment at the thermodynamic and quantum noise limits can revolutionize current paradigms in threat anticipation and counter-action by providing insight for the first time into highly-correlated climate and atmospheric variables. The unique combination of emerging computationally-intelligent adaptive laser synthesis using correlated photon diversity and a distributed in situ quantum sensor network could provide the US Navy with an unparalleled capacity to understand, predict, control, and act on rapidly changing atmospheric phenomenaand security breaches. The outcomes of this research will expand beyond the US Navy and provide a cost-effective solution to reducethe risks of atmospheric operations and enable maritime and atmospheric science and exploration, environmental catastrophe prediction and mitigation strategies, beam energy propulsion, and space exploration to bolster long-term US and global well-being and security.less","750,000",2023,2026
0,Engineering Bacteria Transmembrane for Efficient Extracellular Electron Transfer,United States Department of the Navy,to Yu Huang,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can directly convert over 50% of chemical energy stored in many sources of biodegradable organic matters to electrical energy through the microorganism metabolism. The diverse bacteria species and the wide range of fuels make MFC an attractive technology for renewable bioelectric power generation from biomass and from wastewater treatment. For this reason, MFCs andthe relevant bacteria have attracted increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities. However, the current density and power density obtained from the typical Shewanella MFCs are generally too low to satisfy practical applications. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the MFC anodic electrodes by increasing the bacteria loading capacity, or enhancingthe electrode conductivity, the output power density of the MFCs to date appeared to have hit the plateau and can rarely exceeds 3W/m2. This limitation comes from the limited charge transfer efficiency in the transmembrane and extracellular electron transfer processes which generally involve sluggish electron hopping through redox centers. Therefore, to break through the power limit of the current MFCs, it is essential to design and fabricate novel anodic electrodes that can futations to efficiently deliver the metabolic electrons to the external electrodes.Here we propose to engineer at the bacteria levelto fundamentally improve the charge transfer efficiency. We will perform systematic studies from synthesizing novel bacteria-metal hybrid materials, understand the charge transport mechanism within, and achieve the overarching goal of greatly enhanced MFC output performance to a practically relevant level. The focus of the project is to construct and offer insights on extracellular electron transfer mechanisms with transmembrane metal nanoparticles. Specifically, we will: (1) use reduced graphene oxide/metal (e.g. Ag and Cu) electrodes to functionalize the charge-producing microbes (model system: Shewanella) to build a dense and highly biocompatible ba for current, power and Coulombic efficiency tests to evaluate the output performance; (3) explore the extracellular electron transfer mechanisms in bacteria with transmembrane nanoparticles through single cell studies in micro-electrode device and building effective circuit models to obtain comprehensive understanding for future MFC development. The successful demonstration of our proposed concept will open up exciting opportunities for the design and engineering of a new generation of bioelectronic device system for both energy harvesting and bio-sensing.Potential Naval Relevance: The proposed studies aim to elucidate fundamental charge transport mechanism at the bacterium level through microelectronic studies, and to apply the knowledge in the construction of novel bacteria-metal hybrid MFCs that reach the performance level for practical devices. These proposed studies will provide knowledge needed to breakthrough the limitation in exoelectrogenic bacteria extracellular electron transfer. The outcome of the proposed studies will lead to the development a novel approach for the synthesis of bio-materials hybrids, the fundamental understanding of the extracellular electron transfer across the bacteria-inorganic interfaces and establish the important intellectual underpinnings for engineering highly efficient microbial assemblies.

0,"Partial Differential Equations, Nonconvex Optimization and Deep Neural Nets",United States Department of the Navy,to Stanley Osher,"We propose to develop links between partial differential equations (PDEs) and deep neural nets (DNNs) with the aim of developing new deep learning techniques which lead to conceptually simple, practical, very accurate and theoretically provable algorithms. This builds on work we have done earlier in [COO+17], where we used ideas from Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations and control and differential games to improve training time, modify and improve the training algorithm. In [WLL+18, ZYB+18] we introduced new interpolation to fill in missing scientific and image data. In [PYR+18] we developed techniques in nonconvex optimization algorithms based on HJ to obtain state-of-the-art phaseretrieval algorithms. We extended this idea to greatly improve generalization accuracy of DNNs, [WLL+18]. This was done by unifying deep learning and kernel methods with PDE based control problems. These new optimizationtechniques also led to very efficient, accurate and fast weight quantization of DNNs, [YZL+18] This was again related to HJ initial value problems and led usto outperform the state-of-the-art Binary Connect [CBD+15]. We generalized our ideas in [COO+17] to solve different HJ equations via the Lax formula, which led us to generalized proximal (G-prox) algorithms. These simple alternativesto stochastic gradient descent so far seem to give superior results in generalization accuracy. We have found the equivalence of deep ResNets with PDE based control problems. We used the labeled data to obtain an accurateinterpolation and trained the net via data dependent implicit activation functions. This, remarkably, boosts the accuracy roughly 20-30 percent relative tostandard DNN for Cifar 10 and Cifar 100 datasets and substantially reduces the lack of training issue. We expect to improve our algorithm with an even better interpolation scheme, a better back propagation method and by the use ofDenseNet, which can be interpreted in our framework as a multistep ODE method. Our applications will include: transfer learning, improved face recognition, 3D shape recognition and spatio-temporal data modeling. We willgeneralize our low-bit weight network work by investigating larger model capacity at wider bit width such as 4-bit networks. Additionally we will develop quantized activation. We will also apply our quantization technique to acceleratethe inference and enable fast object detection with CPU only. For our G-prox work, we propose to implant this into popular learning engines and incorporate other existing acceleration techniques, including adaptive learning, Nesterovmomentum and others.

0,Organizational Hierarchical Functional Material Structures Using Biomolecular-Material Interactions,United States Department of the Navy,to Yu Huang,"The nanostructuring approach to highly performing materials functions has produced a paradigm shift and opens new era of investigation for many functional materials, including electronics (e.g. high speed devices, spintronics), photonics (e.g. metamaterials) and energy materials (thermoelectric, catalysis, 3D batteries and solar cells). Central to these investigations is the precise control of synthesis and assembly of nanostructures in hierarchical fashion, which has been the grand challenges and the focus of both fundamental research and applied studies for engineered materials. On the other hand, using simple and effective strategies, Nature can exert precise control over the formation of material structures to achieve superior functions, and it does so energy efficiently, at benign conditions and with minimal impact on the environment. Scientists have long sought to produce technologically important materials by mimicking Nature???s ability to create complex structures that successfully execute specialized functions by controlling all their characteristics, including composition, size, morphology, orientation, and organization. Significantly, most of the intricate nanoscale structures produced by Nature aregenerated in ambient conditions and have not been achieved artificially, even though conventional chemical syntheses operate with more degrees of freedom through manipulation of temperature and pressure. These remarkable outcomes of natural processes are possible due to the exquisite molecular recognition properties of biomolecules such as proteins and polypeptidesthat are the result of evolutionary refinement over the last billion years. However, the principles underlying biomolecular recognition of specific materials in complex solutions are still poorly understood. Determining those principles is critical if bio-inspired approaches to in vitro synthesis and assembly of functional structures are to succeed. In this project, we propose to use the combination of knowledge and tools ranging from bio-recognition studies, crystal growth physics and assembly kinetics, in situ imaging to address these fundamental challenges, and to formulate globally applicable biomimetic principles thatcan guide the efficient production of material structures with hierarchical assembly to deliver superior functionality. Particularly the diverse biomolecular recognitions provide the base to explore and achieve heterogeneous integration of different material functions in all three dimensions, which is not readily available in previously demonstrated approaches It is expected that the research described above will provide unprecedented control over synthesis and hierarchical assembly of nanoscale building blocks into functional devices withsuperior performance. The ability to do so can bring great impact on technologies ranging from smart materials, clean energy generation to environmental protection.

0,Foray: the Autonomous Agile Airship Armada,United States Department of the Navy,to Ankur Mehta,"1 OverviewFor long duration aerial missions, we turn to lighter-than-air vehicles (LTAVs): by using buoyancy forces to counteract gravity, we obviate the need for constant thrust power, and can thus maintain flight nearly indefinitely. Without active thrust, LTAVs necessarily have much stricter weight constraints, with their dimension prescribing a maximum lifting volume and therefore allowable weight of sensing, actuation, communications, and processing hardware for the entire mission, along with their power system and structural scaffolding. The design question then becomes highly integrated: no longer can each subsystem be designed independently and assembled into the final robot; the cross-subsystem impacts on weight, power, and configuration form critical constraints on design decisions.To regain exibility in system design, we can move to a multi-robot swarm, building an armada ofheterogeneous LTAVs each optimized for specific subtasks in the mission specification. This creates opportunities to enhance overall performance and robustness, while at the same time introducing other design challenges such as communications and coordination as operators cannot anymore directly drive the entire collection of robot actuators. Thus, control over this armada must incorporate autonomy, particularly exploiting the benefits while addressing the challenges of a distributed multi-agent system.Within this autonomous armada, the individual agents must be optimized for their mission tasks, which in this case are modeled by the 99++ Luftballoons World Cup, an aerial soccer game. The agents must find and direct balls through an opponent's goals, while guarding their own goals against opponent robots trying to do the same. A winning strategy therefore calls for agile robots that can out-maneuver the adversarial robots both on defense and offense, reacting faster to the changing game state to better block and score. In this proposal, we introduce Foray: the Autonomous Agile Airship Armada, that addresses these mission goals through the integrated co-design across robot subsystems. In designing our multi-agent LTAV system, we will implement sensing and control algorithms that effectively use the constrained resources across our team to accomplish autonomous behavior robust to the adversarial conditions of the game. Each individual agent will be co-designed across mechanical and electrical systems to support the necessary autonomous algorithms while realizing highly agile dynamics with minimal actuation hardware and power.2 Project Description2.1 Agile vehiclesAt the core of the Foray swarm are a number of potentially heterogeneous LTA robots. The success of the swarm in the game starts with the dynamic capabilities of each individual robot. With game subtasks involving blocking opponent scorers, scoring around opponent blockers, or beating opponent seekers to targets, the key design goal will be to create an agile LTAV that can outmaneuver other designs. To do so, we will explore two new control2.2 Distributed autonomyWith the Foray team comprising a multi-agent swarm of LTAVs across a large arena, we must design on-board autonomy to enact the behaviors necessary to accomplish the game. In this project we will use pre-programmed high level behaviors and focus our efforts on the low level behaviors supporting the autonomous tasks. In particular, we consider the problem of distributed state estimation using sensing and controls. The key design principle for the Foray autonomy becomes minimality through efficiency. We look to extract maximal value from each sensor reading, data transfer, and control action.less","750,000",2020,2023

These systems consists of a large number of hierarchically organized elements, and exhibit complex and emerging behaviors and equilibrium through local interactions. The most complex system, like the robot autonomy consists of physical environments and social agents. The latter can make plans to act on the environments and have perceptual capabilities to perceive the environments, understand the causal effects of actions, and even infer the minds and intents of other agents through communications. Modeling such complex systems is the goal of multiple scientific disciplines, and learning these models from data is the concern of statistical and machine learning. In this framework, we propose to develop a new paradigm that integrates both inductive and deductive learning in a closed loop. ¥Inductive learning is example-based and data-driven, and is good for learning the concepts, relations, and parameters in some predefined hypothesis spaces for specific tasks; ¥Deductive learning is utility-based and goal-driven. It can explain system behaviors using its utility functions and causal chains. It can create new concepts and invent object categories and tools, which are then taught to others agents by inductive learning. By integrating the inductive and deductive learning, we will be able to learn more advanced models in a series of advanced hypothesis spaces. Thus our framework unifies two other dimensions: ¥Mixing supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning in a continuous spectrum. ¥Mixing observational and experimental data in a continuous spectrum.

A self-healing composite material is proposed that will autonomously sense and repair localized damage in composite structures. Healing is accomplished via two main components. The first component is a thermally remendable polymer matrix that is integrated into the structural carbon fiber composite and has the ability to be healed with the application of heat. The second component is an addressable conducting network (ACN) that will both sense resistance changes due to damage in carbon fiber composites as well as deliver current for resistive heating to addressable locations within the composite. A health management system will continuously monitor the health of the structural composite and will determine the location and extent of detected damage as well as the potential for autonomous repair. BENEFIT: The proposed technology provides a solution to the serious problem of detecting and repairing impact, delamination and microcracking damage in aircraft and vehicles. Currently, such damage can go undetected resulting in a compromised structure that can endanger personnel and reduce mission readiness. The software developed in conjunction with the novel structural designs developed within this program will allow maintenance personnel to continuously monitor the health of composite structures. When damage is detected, a healing procedure can be initiated to rapidly restore the integrity of the structure. Commercial and military aircraft are increasingly constructed from carbon fiber, and the proposed monitoring and healing technology will reduce maintenance cost and increase service lifetimes of composite air frames.

During terminal homing, when the interceptor relies on its IR seeker, there are many events within the seeker field of view (FOV) that can contribute to a failure to intercept. Some major events and associated IR image phenomena are: (1) Booster intensity overwhelming the intensity of the hard body, (2) re-entry vehicle (RV) separation from a post boost vehicle (PBV), and (3) transient shock wave for an endo-atmospheric intercept. Our algorithms differentiate several objects of different intensities, using the image data directly to find the centroid of the hard body. In this context, the only detection heuristic is that there may be more than one object within the images. The proposed image processing algorithms will be combined in Phase II in an integrated fashion with the physical dynamics of the plume, shock wave, and hard body. Our algorithms include feature detection, identification, and tracking. Approaches that we investigated in the Phase I include the following: (1) image segmentation (active contour methods) to detect the separate parts of the boosting missile, (2) use of the object region rather than edge information for tracking, (3) consideration of image noise, and (4) use of shapes for further discrimination and classification. This approach has been successfully demonstrated in a laboratory environment on medical MRIs and commercial aviation applications, as well as on data generated by missile simulation programs CHARM and CHAMP. We have demonstrated in Phase I that our region based active contour techniques are robust under noisy conditions. We have also demonstrated that our algorithms are general and flexible, and can be used for single or multi-color seekers and different bandwidths with minimal parameter modifications. For a multi-color case, each color can be processed independently or in parallel, and the images fused subsequently. Or, the multi-color image can be processed simultaneously to render a single segmented result. In addition to the KEI PTHH problem, the imaging algorithms and prototype software that we developed in Phase I were applied to RV midcourse aim point selection rendering promising results also. The key feature of our approach is that it is a general and robust image recognition/segmentation technique that is applicable to an EO/IR sensor in the BMDS environment. During Phase I of this STTR, we worked closely with the MDA Project Hercules and major DoD contractors, who have endorsed our study for STTR Phase II. We intend to develop core and generic capabilities using innovative active contours techniques during Phase II to help solve the challenging problem of PTHH in boosting targets. Based on promising preliminary results in Phase I, we believe we can tailor our algorithms in Phase II and apply them successfully to the RV aim-point selection problem in mid course and terminal phases of flight, as well as to Target Object Mapping (TOM). Our objective is to develop detailed algorithms and tools for potential insertion into BMDS block upgrades and for use in other domains, focusing on missile/air defense applications in Phase II. We intend to extend our approach to non-DoD government applications and to private sector commercial markets in Phase III, in particular using this technology in the medical diagnostic fields (which the UCLA Medical School has shown great interest in collaboration) such as cancer and cardiovascular disease diagnostics.less","749,996",2005,2006
0,Stable High Bandwidth AO Control with physical DM constraints,United States Department of the Air Force,to Troy Rhoadarmer,"Adaptive optics (AO) can compensate for the aberrating effects of atmospheric turbulence which degrade the performance of high energy laser (HEL) weapon systems and, as such, is an enabling technology for effective deployment of HEL weapon systems. A key component in an HEL AO system is the deformable mirror (DM). However, mechanical constraints in currently available DMs limits AO system performance in stressing engagements. Guidestar teamed with UCLA to develop methods that can provide AO performance with a constrained DM that is comparable to performance with an ideal DM that does not have these physical constraints.

0,Efficient Multi-Scale Radiation Transport Modeling,United States Department of the Air Force,to Ramakanth Munipalli,"Radiative heat transfer is a dominant mode of heat transfer in combustion and propulsion systems as well as for hypersonic flow encountered during planetary entry. Solution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), which is an integro-differential equation, places stringent requirements on the computational resources as: (a) the radiation depends both on spatial and angular dimensions, (b) radiation transfer occurs over a wide spectral range (multi-group), and (c) the participating often exhibits strong dependence on the local flow properties leading to a wide variation in the optical thickness (multi-scale). Efficient numerical algorithms and solvers to address issues of accuracy and computational time are much needed. In this proposal, we seek to unite two powerful techniques in contemporary scientific computing: (1) The discontinuous Galerkin methods, and (2) Graphical processor (GPU) programming, with advances in the prediction of radiative gas dynamics. HyPerComp Inc. has teamed with subject-matter experts, UCLA – who would provide their expertise in development of radiation gas models and validation cases, and Brown University – who would provide their expertise in GPU computing specialized for DG methods to expand upon HyPerComp’s core expertise in developing innovative algorithms and techniques in high-performance-computing, commercialization and distribution for industrial use through strategic partnerships. BENEFIT: The proposed research would result in major breakthrough and a paradigm-shift in how radiative transport equation is solved, from using CPUs to using GPUs, which would be cheaper and at the same time order of magnitude faster. A fast, robust, and accurate RTE solver would find numerous commercial applications such as analysis of exhaust gases in stationery power plants, simulation of photobioreactors to accurately modeling light absorption and scattering by microorganisms and bubbles, radiative analysis of furnaces to minimize energy loss and pollution emissions etc., as well as military and aerospace applications related to thermal analysis of combustion and propulsion systems and target detection and identification (remote sensing).less","749,975",2010,2012

Specifically, we developed Finite Elements Method (FEM) models to design nanoscale periodic magnetic particle arrays, which are used as the basis of an electrically smallmagnetic dipole antenna. We studied multiple configurations of nano-dipole antenna arrays and have determined unique methods for controlling the dipoles . The array configurations and device design structures determined in Phase I provide a strong basis for the fabrication of thin film, high radiation power density magnetic dipole elements for use in antenna applications. During Phase II, the team will prototype the antenna for operation in UHF band, develop necessary evaluation board (input matching and feed network) for the antenna and demonstrate its performance with measurements in anechoic chamber.; BENEFIT: This technology has a tremendous potential for both military and commercial platforms. Current antenna designs rely primarily on the electromagnetic resonance characteristic of anelectrically conductive antenna structure. This results in large antenna sizes and makes communication and SIGINT capability at VHF and UHF frequencies challenging for a wide range of platforms, but most notably small UAS systems.

The objectives are to develop a physics-based understanding of transonic aeroelasticity near Mach 1, and to provide high-fidelity experimental data for validating aeroelastic codes. The wind tunnel tests will, for the first time, explore the Mach number freeze phenomenon and its role in natural mode flutter instabilities and shaping the transonic ""chimneys"" in the flutter boundary. The experimental data sets obtained during Phase II will enable the designer to optimize aeroelastic stability margins and control effectiveness in the early stages of design process. This capability will not only result in more optimal designs, but will also mitigate the risks associated with the development of future high-speed aircraft by avoiding aeroelastic surprises during flight tests. Both outcomes are of significant relevance to both the Air Force as well as to the civilian aircraft industry. The resulting process will be rendered robust and repeatable to the point of fast and affordable on-demand manufacturing for future commercialization purposes during Phase III.

0,Advanced Transport Damage Tolerant GLARE Hybrid Bonded Wing Structure,United States Department of the Air Force,to David Kordonowy,"ABSTRACT: Aurora and UCLA""s Phase I efforts demonstrated the feasibility of the synthesis of advanced hybrid materials, unitized structure, and metallic-composite bonding on the Air Force Next Generation Transport. The X-55 Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA) wing was used to demonstrate the damage tolerance of Glass-Reinforced Aluminum Laminate (GLARE), which is an advanced hybrid material with outstanding fatigue and impact resistance, as well as high static strength. Three-dimensional woven fiberglass Pi-Preforms were used to joint the members together as a unitized structure. Advanced composite components were able to be combined with the metallic structure through the use of the Pi-Preform joints without the galvanization issue associated with composite-metallic bonded structure. A weight savings of 35% was shown for the outboard wing leading edge assembly compared with the existing X-55 ACCA wing leading edge. In Phase II Aurora proposes to develop a structural component, such as the outboard leading edge of the X-55 ACCA Demonstrator Vehicle, to demonstrate the benefits of GLARE unitized structure through manufacturing and testing of a representative article. UCLA will extend their multi-scale constitutive model to predict damage tolerance within the GLARE panels and metallic-composite bonded Pi-Preform joints. BENEFIT: Moving to a unitized GLARE structure on the X-55 ACCA Demonstrator Vehicle will provide a roughly 35% weight reduction in the outboard leading edge due to the improved damage tolerance of GLARE material. Reductions in weight and maintenance costs associated with fatigued and damaged components are possible throughout an aircraft using GLARE material in unitized structural configurations with fiberglass Pi-Preforms. Potential applications include the leading edge of the wing, lower wing skin, cargo doors, and access panels onboard the Air Force Next Generation Transport as well as many other platforms. Aurora envisions applications after demonstration on the X-55 ACCA Demonstrator Vehicle to initially include the Northrop Grumman GlobalHawk and Sikorsky CH-53K S-92 platforms, for which Aurora currently fabricates metallic and composite components. Additionally, the multi-scale constitutive models developed will allow for the publication of new damage tolerant design techniques for use by government and industry.less","749,946",2010,2011
0,AgileBeam Reconfigurable Free Space Optical Communication System,United States Department of the Air Force,to Todd Chauvin,"Free Space Optical (FSO) communication systems provide many benefits for satellite communications, including high data rates and low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) compared to traditional RF communication systems. Additionally, FSO systems operate without RF emissions and are inherently immune to RF interference and jamming. The narrow optical beams and small Field-of-View of the optical receivers also make FSO systems LPI/LPD and difficult to disrupt by intentional jamming. Space-based FSO systems have been demonstrated, and are being considered for many upcoming commercial and military satellite systems. However, widespread adoption of space-based FSO systems has not occurred, partly due to the custom nature of most FSO systems. For each space-based application, a custom FSO system is typically developed. What is needed is a reconfigurable FSO terminal that can be used for a wide variety of missions, including operation in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits, and supporting both crosslink and up/down-link operation. To address this need, SA Photonics proposes the development of the AgileBeam space-based FSO system.

The proposed system extends the instantaneous bandwidth of an existing radio frequency (RF) receiver with compressed sensing algorithms and modified front end hardware.  In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed hardware and algorithms were demonstrated on relevant waveforms.

This unique approach allows one to program any gate between several different states at very high modulation rates and low power consumption, thus allowing tremendous opportunities to engineer all-optical Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Gates modulation is nonvolatile and one can use the proposed solution to built reconfigurable memory arrays. The proposed reconfigurable gates, will enable optical information processing engines with unmatched speed, functionality, integration density and low power dissipation. Specifically to the Air Force, the proposed solution can provide integrated processing platforms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, where the processing speed and integration density are critical. In Phase I the team fully validated the proposed approach by experimentally demonstrating optical magnetization switching at 100 times lower laser fluence to pulse duration ratio and predicted 10,000 fold enhancement in appropriate structures. In Phase II the team will experimentally demonstrate 10,000 fold enhancement of mentioned ratio in plasmonic nanostructures and will fabricate and demonstrate nonvolatile reconfigurable optical gate operating at 80GHz frequency. In Phase III MicroXact will commercialize the proposed technology. BENEFIT: The proposed nonvolatile reconfigurable optical gate technology can greatly benefit existing and emerging DoD missions, where fast processing of large volumes of data is needed (remote sensing, e.g., hyperspectral imaging etc.). Also, the all-optical ultrafast generation of strong, highly localized magnetic fields will find applications in chemical sensing (such as explosive detection, biological and chemical warfare agent detecting/identification, etc.).

0,Scalable Hands-On Engineering Experiences in Community Colleges,United States Department of the Navy,to Gregory Pottie,"Community colleges provide low-cost and high-quality opportunities to acquire the necessary skills to transfer to 4-year engineering colleges. Compared to 4-year institutions, the population served skews heavily towards underrepresented minorities, individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and students following non-traditional paths, such as veterans. This provides an opportunity for a broad pool of students to obtain skills that are vital for the nation’s workforce in general, and defense industries in particular. Unfortunately, for students interested in engineering, at many colleges there are few courses that provide hands-on skills. This disadvantages students who transfer, requiring them to make up the material at considerable cost in time and money, and worse, causes many to become discouraged by a curriculum heavy in math and science but lacking in the applications that drew them to engineering in the first place. Community colleges often have only a single instructor to cover all of engineering, and in many cases lack facilities for laboratories. To overcome these problems, we have developed a model electrical engineering curriculum in collaboration with a partner college that makes use of student-owned kits. This provides a capstone design experience that requires no specialized equipment at colleges and can yield the same increased level of engagement we have seen with similar courses at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We propose 1) to scale hands-on engineering experiences to multiple partner colleges across many engineering disciplines 2) develop on-line versions of other required engineering courses to enable broad access within the community college system and support transfer students, 3) create a network of community college instructors who can provide mutual support to sustain engineering instruction, 4) develop chapters of student organizations to support student-led activities at partner institutions and 5) create a bridge program for students transferring to UCLA, including increased opportunities for internships. In this way, both curricular and extra-curricular design activities will be spread, with support networks to facilitate exchange of best practices and enable updating of course and activity content. The result will be increased retention of students in engineering programs, and reduced time to degree and thus educational costs for the students.less","748,664",2018,2019
0,Joint Transport and Routing Optimization for Adaptive Satellite Networks,United States Department of the Air Force,to Soon Oh,"ABSTRACT: Due to increasing communications demand for tactical mission operations force the DoD to initiative to migrate the existing circuit-switched, bent-pipe satellite communication systems to the onboard packet switched satellite systems using Internet Protocols. The new approach offers significant flexibility and performance gain, but there are still tough challenges, e.g., high bit error rate, long round trip time, heterogeneous satellite nodes and end users, different end user QoS requirements, etc. To respond to this challenge, we propose Joint Transport and Routing Optimization for Adaptive Satellite Networks (JTRO-ASN) for the satellite network that establishes end-to-end routes in the space exploiting inter-satellite and inter-level links connecting satellites on different orbits and constellations that provide advantages of reducing ground station dependencies, decreasing end-to-end latencies and delays, and supporting traffic prioritization and distributing traffic loads via multiple available routes. To establish routes in the space, it uses predefined satellite orbits to predict the topology and to calculate routes. Furthermore, JTRO-ASN shares relevant information across the layer boundaries so that it achieves resource utilization and protocol operation optimization and improvements. Upon using inter-satellite and inter-level links, the routing algorithm is able to find multiple paths between satellites and with the cross-layer optimization approach; in addition, JTRO-ASN can support users QoS requirements. For example, it gives the highest priority flows more opportunities to reach the destination or it provides. Based on experience and Phase I achievements, i.e., routing protocol design, the JTRO-ASN team will develop and implement the network and transport protocols and present feasibility and performance of the protocols via demonstration. In addition, the team will conduct theoretical and analytical study for the satellite networking. BENEFIT: In order to meet the modern military mission critical operation requirements, secure, high bandwidth for a large number of heterogeneous war-fighting users is required. The proposed IP-based satellite network architecture will greatly benefit the Air Forces satellite communication programs by enabling the linkage of user preferences and network conditions, and significantly reducing both latency between network nodes, and transmission failures, among other identified objectives. UtopiaCompressions (UC) technologies will greatly enhance communications at the tactical edges, increasing mission efficiency and effectiveness and enhancing Air Force program objectives overall. Moreover, an enhanced broadband satellite communications system is a critical component of DoDs network centric state. Defense: Key Structural changes outlined in the U.S. DoDs FY 2011 budget will increase demand for secure, broadband satellite communications through increases in targeted personnel such as Special Forces, as well transformation of Army Multi-functional and Functional Support (MFF) brigades to a modular design. Enhanced satellite capabilities will, under the future paradigm, be driven down through the brigade to the company level. The growth rate of the military satellite communications sector is projected at 5.6 percent annual growth over the next ten years, dependent on the advent of critical enabling technologies like what UC proposes here. Current DoD programs which would benefit from UCs enabling satellite communications technologies include numerous ISR programs which will require significantly increased and reliable communications capabilities to deliver performance projections, as well as the UAVs which carry the ISR payloads and communicate with other mobile machines. Specific programs include the Global Hawk vehicles and the upgraded Predator drone, Gray Eagle. Transition opportunities for the proposed technologies exist within the Wideband Global SATCOM Deployment. Commercial Applications: The commercial potential for the proposed technology is significant and slated to grow substantially. Satellites worth a total of $250 billion should be launched over the course of the next 15 years, with 1,600 satellites by 2025. Drivers for this growth include GEO ComSat replacement, government contracts, Science and Navigation missions, and the Ka-band/HTS me too syndrome. UCs proposed routing technologies will be critical enabling components in support of this growth. UCs proposed technologies will also provide critical capabilities to the commercial Mobile Satellite Services market, which relies on reliable connection between heterogeneous, mobile devices. The global MSS market will grow to $10.2 billion in 2020, more than doubling from todays volume. The world Satellite Machine-to-Machine communications sector of MSS supports applications used for logistical tracking, telemetry, remote monitoring, geo fencing, security, and scientific monitoring, providing various benefits for industries ranging from agriculture to retail. This sector is strongly dominated by the United States which holds 62 percent market share and its revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2016.

0,Development of a Renormalization Group Approach to Multi-Scale Plasma Physics Computation,United States Department of the Air Force,to John Luginsland,"NumerEx/UCLA propose advanced theoretical and computational research in the application of the renormalization group (RG) to speed the development of advanced methods to simulate dense plasmas exhibiting critical kinetic phenomena.  These dense plasmas combine a wealth of length and time scales by virtue of their high plasma frequencies and short Debye lengths, while still requiring long length/time scale simulation due to the large size of plasma, and the evolution of the critical system physics.  Starting with an analytic approach to a fundamental plasma process, namely that of electrostatic shielding, we will demonstrate how short length scale behavior can be incorporated in coarse representations.  This naturally leads to a numerical weighting approach that can be used in conjunction with kinetic methods to systematically handle dense plasmas in a kinetic framework.  Additionally, we propose extending temporal renormalization group methods to investigate the role of the collision operator in dense plasma situations.  This complements our spatial RG approach by suggesting the means to ensure the fidelity of multi-scale numerical methods dynamically.  These two approaches will be combined to provide for a multi-dimensional plasma physics tool based on RG methods. BENEFIT: Renormalization Group (RG) methods will dramatically increase the capability to accurately and efficiently model multi-scale phenomena in plasma physics.  A wide range of devices from directed energy sources of electromagnetic energy, spacecraft thrusters, plasma processing devices, to fusion reactors all exhibit behavior where short length/time scale events influence the system-level performance of the device.  RG-based modeling tools naturally capture multi-scale physics, leading to both improved modeling codes and novel high technology devices.  Potential applications include first-principles modeling software based on RG methods for fundamental research, parametric tools with well-characterized domains of application to aid the development of plasma-based technology, and engineering services leading to improved experimental hardware in the fusion science, directed energy, and thruster arenas.less","736,009",2008,2010

0,Low-rank compression of resolvent operators for high-Re flows,United States Department of the Army,to Kunihiko Taira,"Theoretical analysis of turbulent flows has been a challenge due to its complex nonlinear dynamics that span across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. With ever increasing computational resources being readily available to fluid mechanicians, access to high-fidelity flow field data has become possible. However, extracting physical insights from data beyond the traditional statistical analysis for their uses in applications including flow control or system designs has been limited. This is due to the fact that analysis can be burdened by the extremely large degrees of freedom of turbulent flows that require significant computational power and memory allocations. In recent years, resolvent analysis has gained interest from the fluid mechanics community for its ability to reveal the input-output relationship with respect to a base state, including timeaveraged turbulent flow. Resolvent analysis is based on the concept of a particular solution under forcing. For this reason, resolvent analysis provides insights on how the flow responds to harmonic input to the system as well as the transient dynamics. As such, the resolvent analysis becomes a very attractive tool for characterizing, modeling, and controlling high-dimensional turbulent flows. Noteworthy here is that resolvent analysis can be performed about time-averaged turbulent base flows if fluctuations about the base states are statistically stationary. Resolvent analysis stands out as essentially the only operator-based modal analysis techniques that can handle practical engineering flows at high Reynolds numbers. However, the applications of resolvent analysis are generally restricted to simple laminar flows or flows of moderate Reynolds numbers. The time is now ripe to address the curse of dimensionality and extend the applicability of resolvent analysis. With the so-called Òbig dataÓ and Òbig operatorsÓ being the focus of analysis by applied mathematicians and data scientists in recent years, ground breaking concepts have emerged in the development of computationally tractable techniques that can help expand the horizon of resolvent analysis for high-dimensional flows. Included in these recent advances are randomized numerical linear algebra, compression of low-rank operators, and discrete adjoint analysis. In this proposed work, we combine the latest concepts from data science to revisit the original resolvent analysis and reformulate its algorithm for computational speedup and reduction in memory requirement. The proposed eÀort will focus not only on the computational issues but also on lowering the hurdle for implementing resolvent analysis into preexisting DNS/LES codes. The current work will develop theoretical formulations for performing resolvent analysis with the ability to separate time-scales from multi-physics flow problems. Moreover, the results from resolvent analysis at high-Reynolds number require some level of interpretability. As flows become more complex, one often encounters increased levels of incoherence in the state variables. In these situations, open questions arise about how resolvent analysis techniques should be utilized to examine the flow physics. The latter part of the project will focus on disseminating the developed low-rank compression techniques appropriate for complex high-dimensional fluid flows by seeking advice from our industrial partners. Robustness of developed techniques for data quality will also be examined for novel data structures.less","699,485",2021,2025
0,Modeling Intrinsic Variability and Connectivity in Shelf and Littoral Circulation,United States Department of the Navy,to James C. McWilliams,"We propose research on “Modeling Intrinsic Variability and Connectivity in Shelf and Littoral Circulation” using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) both in idealized flow configurations for process studies and in several realistic simulation situations in support of the planning and interpretation of ONR field measurements. ROMS is well suited as an investigative tool for this oceanic regime. It is widely used in regional simulations of coastal circulations; it has a mature one- and two-way grid-nesting capability that allows for fine-scale calculations of local flow phenomena that are importantly influenced by the larger-scale circulations that comprise the local environment; it utilizes the skillful K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) for the surface and bottom turbulent boundary-layer flux profiles; and it incorporates the surface wave-current interaction theoretical framework based on averaging over the primary phase oscillations of the waves that represents the important role of Stokes drift in providing wave-induced Coriolis and vortex forces and material advection of scalar concentrations, in addition to additional wave-related parameterizations for depth-induced breaking (surf) and enhanced interior turbulent mixing. The research directions are to investigate submesoscale fronts, density filaments, topographic wakes, rip currents, and coherent vortices on small horizontal scales ( 10s-1000s m) with full wave-current interaction in the context of continental-shelf flows and their approach to the shoreline. A particular focus is on how the boundary layer turbulence interacts with submesoscale surface-layer frontogenesis and how bottom-drag generates vorticity that separates into unstable wakes. Two developmental directions are to further incorporate non-hydrostatic dynamics into ROMS for very fine-scale flows where parameterizations reach their limits of validity and implement downscale shelf- and surf-domain nesting using operational HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) for the boundary conditions. The modeling approach involves coupling to surface gravity wave dynamics, both in simplified, “spectrum-peak” ray-theory models and in the operational full-spectrum models, SimulatingWAves Nearshore (SWAN) andWave-Watch III (WW3), to capture the Doppler-shifting refraction effect of currents on the waves. The primary hypotheses are (1) the shelf and littoral zone manifests high intrinsic variability beyond the wind-, tide- and waveforced flows; (2) surf eddies and submesoscale shelf eddies have intermittent strong interactions with each other; and (3) these eddies play a dominant role in setting the rates of material transport across and along bathymetric gradients, as well as vertically through the pycnocline. The realistic simulations will be performed for several wind and wave regimes at sites along the U.S. West Coast and the northern Gulf of Mexico including the selected sites for ONR field experiments. A particular issue is the relative importance of littoral current instability and (stochastic) variability of incident surface waves in instigating surf eddy activity; this topic will be collaboratively investigated with Prof. Falk Feddersen (Scripps). Both surf eddies and submesoscale shelf eddies are relatively unexplored phenomena, and the proposed theoretical and computational investigations will lead to new phenomenological discoveries, as well as guidance and interpretation for future ONR field studies. 2.0 Requirements: 1.1 The PI shall perform realistic simulations using ROMS for several wind and wave regimes along the U.S. West Coast and northern Gulf of Mexico. 1.2 The PI shall conduct theoretical and computational studies of surf eddies and submesoscale shelf eddies. 3.0 Deliverables: Reports will be submitted on an annual basis, and a final report will be submitted upon the completion of the award. 1less","648,369",2016,2017

0,"A Universal and Reusable Scheme for Analog, Mixed Signal and Digital Heterogeneous Integration",United States Department of the Navy,to Subramanian Iyer,"A Universal and Reusable Scheme for Analog, Mixed Signal and Digital Heterogeneous Integration. Over the last 50 years, conventional scaling (Moore’s law) has provided continuous improvement in semiconductor device/circuit technology and has resulted in unprecedented advancement in electronic systems. Highly functional systems-on-chip have resulted - combining RF/analog with signal conversion with sophisticated signal processing and complex digital computation. SoCs have brought tremendous performance and cost-effectiveness to defense applications. Historically, CMOS transistor technology scaling has driven the power cost and performance of SoCs. However, traditional scaling is saturating in all three measures due to challenges in both development and manufacturing. In addition, conventional scaled silicon CMOS is not optimized for high performance analog/RF. To achieve breakthrough system performance, transistor technology based on advanced III-V materials systems such as GaN are needed. Therefore, heterogeneous integration of these advanced III-V technology with silicon VLSI is very attractive for many DoD as well as high-end commercial applications. While ONR programs such as DAHI seek to realize chiplet and/or transistor level heterogeneous integration, other approaches such as 3D or interposer integration have advantages in combining existing silicon VLSI and a diverse portfolio of advanced GaN, InGaAs, and GaAs technologies. In this proposal, we seek to address the technology challenge of connecting, with IP reuse, an analog die with minimal digital content to a general purpose processor with high bandwidth, low latency and excellent signal integrity through heterogeneous integration on an a silicon-based Interconnection Fabric (IF) that adopts the tight interconnect schemes of silicon with the heterogeneous nature of Printed Circuit boards. We envision using a silicon substrate as the system substrate with a “translator chip” that can facilitate the analog signal and digital control signals transfer between the advanced III-V MMIC and the silicon SoC die, all attached to this silicon substrate. Key technology innovations on this silicon substrate include a versatile interconnect fabric with fine pitch interconnects comparable to the fat wire levels on a silicon processor connected with as fine a pitch as possible. Note that fine pitch is needed to connect the “translator” chip to the analog and digital chips to increase the overall number of channels. Another key innovation is the translator chip itself and the silicon substrate can be fabricated using commodity silicon technology and processes. In this project, we will explore assembly technique that allows us to connect these dies to interconnect fabric by micro thermal compression bonding (?-TCB) at fine pitch with minimal to no solder. It is envisioned that the translator chip is re-usable either as a cost effective hard chiplet or integrated into the Silicon interconnect fabric as hard IP or a “synthesizable hardened“ macro that can be integrated into a processor CMOS. The hard chiplet made be made as an off-the-shelf item that is easily available and royalty free for DoD approved parties. We will also work closely with Prof. Koyanagi’s team at GINTI/Tohoku University to apply and extend techniques he has developed to this problem.less","613,500",2016,
0,"A novel, purpose designed and homebuilt ESR-STM for research on spin dependent electron transport in",United States Department of the Navy,to Clarice Aiello,"Publicly Releasable Lt. Cmdr. Joshua Swift, Division 342, Biological and Physiological Monitoring and ModelingWe propose to develop, a scanning tunneling probe microscope (STM) with added magnets and radiofrequency excitation for electron spin resonance (ESR) and, control a recently developed instrumentation modality referred to as ESR-STM. ESR-STM enables an extensive control of electroni,c spin coherences as opposed to other modalities of probe microscopy that have been harnessed for spintronics applications, and in, which electronic spins of interest are binary. ESR-STM is thus behind the leap of examining electronic spin transport and interact,ions utilizing a fully quantum description.Our ESR-STM will be primarily developed to elucidate the full quantum character of the c,hiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. CISS is a rare example of magnetic spin response in diamagnetic materials, including,many organic molecules of paramount impor,t, at room temperature, charge transport through nanoscopic chiral structures favors a particular electronic spin orientation. Such,observations abound, and not only have important biological consequences (as most proteins and biomolecules, including DNA, are chir,al), but also tremendous implications for any technology that relies on optimal charge and spin transport in other words, for the,entire quantum device industry.Whereas CISS has been the object of spintronics research, our ESR-STM will allow for experiments on,the phenomenon that are inspired by quantum information and sensing. We will elucidate, for example, how spin coherences evolve when, an electron is transported through a nanochiral potential, be it in a biological molecule, or in an engineered nanomaterial.Using c,hirality as a design basis for biological quantum protocols and quantum devices is unprecedented. The proposed ESR-STM will enable,the quantum description and control of spin, charge, and energy transport through chiral molecules so that quantum information can b,e preserved and transferred at room temperature. A key concept is the manipulation of the magnetic response in chiral molecules and,engineered nanomaterials via the CISS effect. Since this effect also arises in naturally occurring biomolecules such as DNA and alp,ha helices in proteins, the quantum approach enabled by the ESRSTM will open new regimes into the study of quantum phenomena of rel,evance for biology i.e., into the field known as quantum biology.The proposed ESR-STM is an instrument whose benefits can only be, heaped through the strong collaboration of physicists, electrical and material engineers, chemists and bioscientists. The education,cipating labs at UCLA will be enhanced by such a strong interdisciplinary collaboration.The primary benefit of developing this state, of the art instrument within UCLAs California NanoSystems Institute is its access to the broad community provided by the shared, instrumentation facilities.

0,Emerging roles of the exopolysaccharide matrix and surface sensing in bacterial communication and ecology,United States Department of the Army,to Gerard Wong,"Bacteria interact with surfaces in the'natural environment and can form complex multispecies biofilm communities. These communities are fundamental to the biology of bacteria. Not only do biofilms contribute to problems in human health and disease (such as persistent infections), they also present new opportunities in the context of energy and the environment (such as extracellular electron conduction, engineering microbial fuel cells or sensors, and control of biofouling). One of the defining characteristics of bacterial biofilms is the existence of a matrix of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and extracellular DNA (eDNA). In the last 30 years, the field has elucidated a number of the interesting roles of these matrix polymers as 'molecular glues' in biofilm development. Recent work suggest that the matrix can contribute much more broadly, and that EPS is potentially implicated in foundational processes that allow bacteria to sense and respond to surfaces, and processes that allow biofilm assembly in the context of multi-species communities. A recent, exciting finding by the Parsek and Wong laboratories described the deposition of trails of the exopolysaccharide {EPS) PSL on surfaces by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that impacts bacterial sociology: Bacterial 'trail following' behavior was found to be important for the formation of initial, small cellular aggregates that eventually gave rise to larger microcolonies, the first social step in biofilm formation. Equally important from an engineering perspective, our recent studies of bacterial surface sensing are beginning to reveal key components of the signaling framework that controls the biosynthesis of EPS In this proposal, rather than using simple engineering methods to make artificial assemblies of bacteria that look like biofilms, we aim to develop a toolbox for exploiting and reprogramming natural bacterial pathways for biofilm formation. Our recent work on surface sensing suggests that this level of control is possible for the first time. In order to achieve these goals, we plan to leverage recently developed state-of the-art tools not traditionally used in microbiology, such as the tracking of entire bacterial communities at single cell resolution, machine learning, synchrotron x-ray methods, and theoretical physics. Specifically, we aim to investigate two emerging social roles of EPS: (1) We hypothesize that EPS, whether on cell surfaces or on trails, can help cells sense and identify one another, and influence subsequent behavior. Such EPS-enabled 'molecular barcoding' of single bacteria, combined with their technology for sensing and responding to EPS via diguanylate cyclase upregulation, cdiGMP production and EPS biosynthesis, can in principle be harnessed to codify design rules for 'bottom-up' assembly of biofilms via cell-cell recognition. (2) We hypothesize that bacteria-secreted EPS trails can provide a programmable and dynamic 'map' for biofilm organization: This includes the formation and evolution of microcolonies in single species biofilms, and spatial organization of multi-species biofilm formation, where cells can have complex competitive or collaborative relations with one another. Moreover, as an exploratory direction, we will examine how intrinsic interactions between dissimilar polymers within the EPS matrix (such as oppositely charged PEL and extracellular DNA) can lead to unanticipated spatial self-organization. The long term goal is deterministic biofilm design. If our proposal is successful and we elucidate EPS-dependent rules for biofilm development, the new ability to manipulate the biofilm development program can in principle form the basis of damage-tolerant, self-assembling biofilm device architectures: Only a few cells are necessary to grow a device. Moreover, as long as a few cells survive, the device can grow back.less","600,000",2018,2021
0,Integrated Terahertz Emitters and Detectors based on Quantum Optical Materials,United States Department of the Navy,to Mona Jarrahi,"Integrated Terahertz Emitters and Detectors based on Quantum Optical MaterialsMona Jarrahi, University of California Los AngelesAppr,oved for Public ReleaseFurther revolutionary advances in the terahertz field requires a monolithically integrated terahertz optoelec,tronics platform to address the practical limitations posed by the large size, high cost, and complexity of existing terahertz syste,ms. The main roadblock against the development of monolithically-integrated terahertz systems has been the incompatibility of the op,tical sources, amplifiers, modulators, photoconductors, and control electronics used in these systems. On one hand, high-quality sem,iconductors are required for optical sources/amplifiers. On the other hand, short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors are required for u,ltrafast operation of photoconductors. Short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors are prepared by ion implantation, incorporating rare ea,rth compounds, and using low temperatures during the semiconductor growth. All of these techniques introduce a high density of carri,er trap sites within the semiconductor lattice and, therefore, cannot be used for optical generation/amplification. To address the i,ncompatibility problem of the building blocks of terahertz optoelectronic systems, we plan to investigate quantum well (QW) semicond,uctor structures as a novel backbone for terahertz optoelectronic systems. QW semiconductor structures have unique physical properti,es that enable monolithic integration of optical oscillators, amplifiers, waveguides, modulators, photoconductors, photodetectors, a,nd control electronics. On one hand, the energy of QW interband/intersubband transitions can be engineered, enabling stimulated/spon,taneous emission and amplification at the desired wavelengths. On the other hand, quantum-confined Stark shift of the QW semiconduct,or band structure can be controlled through the applied electric potential. Additionally, QW semiconductor structures are compatible, with metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) designs, enabling the realization of control electronic circuits side-by-,side the terahertz optoelectronic devices on the same, contact electrodes of photoconductors implemented along the QW waveguides can provide the ultrafast speeds required for terahertz s,ignal generation and detection, without any need for short-carrier-lifetime semiconductors. The main objective of the proposed resea,rch is realizing photoconductive terahertz emitters and detectors based on III-V QW structures that can be also used for generation,and amplification of optical pump beams with a terahertz beat frequency. Toward this objective, we plan to investigate photoconducti,at frequencies. During the proposed research, we plan to investigate the impact of the device geometry and the composition of the QW, structures on the performance of the photoconductive antennas realized through the III-V QW structures to be used as terahertz sour,ces and detectors. Specifically, we plan to study physical limitations for quantum efficiency, terahertz radiation power, and freque,ncy tunability for photoconductive terahertz sources realized through the III-V QW structures. We also plan to study physical limita,tions for responsivity, noise temperature, and frequency tunability for photoconductive terahertz detectors realized through the III,-V QW structures.

0,Spatial Semantic Representations for Interaction and Explanation,United States Department of the Navy,to Stefano Soatto,"Approved for Public ReleaseThe project focuses on representations of sensory data in support of spatial interaction tasks. Such repr,esentations can be obtained via inductive learning, by processing a fixed dataset of past data and performing feed-forward computati,on at inference time. However, where the error signal is available at inference time, one could instead solve an optimization proble,m and forgo learning altogether. Much of the recent literature in deep learning has focused in inductive inference, where deep netwo,rks have long been the standard for supervised classifications. However, such methods have failed on spatial inference, where most c,ritical inference problems such as localization are still performed using conventional processing pipelines. Furthermore, inductive,learning presents fundamental limitations in assessing confidence, or uncertainty, of the outcome of inference.This proposal aims to, make progress by first developing methods to define and compute uncertainty in an inductively trained state-of-the-art deep neural,network model. Existing methods either focus on uncertainty of the model, as opposed to the outcome of inference, which is of limite,d value in practice, or rely on training methods or inference procedures that are not usable in current large-scale applications. In,deed, even defining uncertainty is non-trivial, and involves counterfactual hypotheses with connections to causal analysis.Where inf,erence-time optimization is possible, learning is not necessary but may be beneficial. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between,purely optimization-based inference and learning. The former are employed in the traditional spatial processing pipeline: sparse fea,ture detection, invariant description, putative correspondence, combinatorial matching, robust data association, epipolar geoemtry e,stimation, bundle adjustment, densification. The latter are employed in semantic inference customary in supervised classification.

Reliable detection of the presence/absence of coliform bacteria and E.coli in water is critical to determine the bacterial quality of water since it is practically difficult to check for every type of disease causing organism. Current methods used to detect and enumerate coliform bacteria and E.coli are based on the incubation of filtered/unfiltered water samples for least 24 hours and analyzing the samples using a benchtop microscope. These methods offer high sensitivity and specificity but are time-consuming, not field portable, and need an expert to operate bulky and expensive optical imaging equipment. In this proposal we will design and develop a lensfree on-chip monitoring platform to image, detect, and count coliform bacteria and E.coli in water samples. This compact and cost-effective platfonn will be field portable and easy to use so that it can be used by minimally trained personnel even in resource limited settings. The performance of the system will be tested with organism-specific cultures and the results will be compared against EPA-approved reference methods. We aim to detect one colony forming unit (CFU) of total coliform or E.coli in-JOO ml of water (i.e., I CFU/IOOmL) in~ 8 hours. The specific objectives of this project can be summarized as follows: (I) Design and development of a field portable lensfree coliform monitoring system, integrated with a custom-made incubator - all weighing less than or equal 5 pounds, excluding the controlling laptop and server back-end.

0,Imaging and Classification of Objects Through Random Diffusers and Occlusions at the Speed of Light,United States Department of the Navy,to Aydogan Ozcan,"Imaging and sensing through diffusive or occluding media present a very challenging problem. Various application areas and fields su,ch as biomedical imaging, astronomy, atmospheric sciences, oceanography, security/defense, robotics, autonomous driving, among other,s, will significantly benefit from a method that can rapidly image and classify objects through random diffusers and opaque occlusio,ns. All the existing body of solutions that have been demonstrated for computational imaging and classification of objects through d,iffusers or occlusions have been based on digital computers and algorithms, and therefore are limited in their speed, energy consump,tion, portability and scalability, especially in resource-constrained settings that demand extremely fast and low-power response. Th,is proposal focuses on computational imaging without a digital computer and aims to design and demonstrate a computer-free, all-opti,cal platform that will image and sense through diffusive media or opaque occlusions, achieving object recognition and image reconstr,uction at the speed of light propagation. Unlike digital image reconstruction or classification methods that use digital computers a,nd algorithms, we propose an all-optical method using a passive platform (i.e., no power consumption, except for the illumination li,ght) composed of a set of transmissive diffractive surfaces that will be jointly optimized to all-optically recognize/classify or re,construct objects behind an unknown diffuser or opaque occlusion. These all-optical diffractive processors and the resulting passive, networks can operate at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum by accordingly scaling the diffractive features proportiona,l to the wavelength of light and therefore can be used with various light sources and detectors that are of interest to ONR, includi,ng but not limited to those in the visible, infrared, terahertz and millimeter-wave regions of the spectrum.

Our experiments on sonoluminescence, laser breakdown and electric discharges in dense gases have reached gamma approx. 1 where we have already discovered unexpected thermodynamic- transport processes which lead to the rapid [less than100.ps] formation of a blackbody. These plasmas can be used to make an ultra-fast, unbreakable optical shutter capable of practically infinite power-handling. A device using this shutter has been published with an application being the low noise readout of trapped ion trap qubits. A description of strongly coupled plasmas at the level of the Navier- Stokes equations of fluid mechanics does not exist. This proposal describes both experimental and theoretical efforts working in unison to obtain such a theory. Experiments on early time spark and laser discharges in dense gases will reach the regime where gamma approx. 100. This time must be shorter than the time required for electrons to thermalize with the ions. During this time we will synchronize streak photos [resolution 10.ps] with full frame images [resolution 100.ps] to obtain the hydrodynamic motion and the equations of state. The hydrodynamics of an SCP will be developed along the lines of Lagrangian field theory with nonlocal equations of state and informed by our experiments.. A key goal is to determine the relative roles played by phonon transport, photon transport, and charge transport for dense strongly coupled plasmas.less","575,000",2021,2024
0,EFFICIENT AND ADAPTABLE MULTIMODAL NEUROSYMBOLIC ARCHITECTURES FOR ROBUST COMPLEX EVENT DETECTION.,United States Air Force,to MANI SRIVASTAVA,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) produce accurate predictions from unstructured high-dimensional data such as sensory information while leveraging high-performance tensor operations in specialized hardware AI accelerators. In many tasks, they have replaced symbolic and algorithmic approaches based on first principles, human knowledge, and mechanistic models. However, the benefits of DNNs come at the cost of reduced abilities to generalize to novel situations, to provide adequate explanations of the outputs, and to reason about complex events. The project will bridge the neural vs. symbolic dichotomy by investigating efficient and adaptable multimodal neurosymbolic (NS) architectures for reasoning about complex spatiotemporal events involving multiple actors doing coordinated maneuvers in dynamic and adversarial settings. Intellectual merit of the project- (1) It re-imagines the critical bottleneck interface between neural and symbolic layers in NS architectures as a dynamic set of concepts that evolves with new data and knowledge. (2) To address efficiency barriers of symbolic layers, it exploits tensorized logic, neural proxies, and NS architecture search. (3) It proposes mechanisms to make NS architectures robust to adversarial perturbations and domain shifts.

0,Role of Carbon Vacancies on Mechanical Properties of Transition-Metal Carbide Thin Films,United States Air Force,to Suneel Kodambaka,"Refractory transition-metal carbides, for example, compounds made of zirconium or tantalumand carbon, are extremely hard materials with some of highest melting points among all solids.Owing to their high mechanical strength even at elevated temperatures and excellent resistanceto wear, ablation, and corrosion, they are particularly attractive for applications in cutting tools,hard protective coatings, and as structural components in spacecrafts, rockets, and hypersonicjets. Often, their operation life-time and performance are limited because they are not ductile, i.e.they break or fracture instead of bending. Enhancing ductility will not only improve theirthermomechanical stability and performance in high-temperature structural applications butcould also open up potentially new low-temperature structural applications.This project aims to develop basic understanding of the role of carbide composition, crystal size,and crystal orientation on its mechanical properties. And use the knowledge gained through thesestudies to design thin layers of transition-metal carbides that are not only hard but also ductile.The underlying hypothesis is that, at small length scales, as in thin films, mechanical behavior ofcarbides can be controllably tuned by varying its composition, crystal size, and crystalorientation. To validate this hypothesis and to achieve the goal, a synergistic combination ofmaterials synthesis and their mechanical properties determined as a function of composition, filmthickness, and orientation using in situ microscopy based nanomechanical tests.Potential Impact and Benefit to the AFOSR: The proposed research will provideunprecedented insights into the role of composition, crystal size, and orientation on mechanicalbehavior of transition-metal carbides.

We have discovered that artificial systems exhibit critical learning periods, much like biological systems, which prompts to the critical role of the transient dynamics in learning, whereas almost the entirety of the analysis and theoretical results in machine learning and optimization are asymptotic. Since the transient is, literally, critical, we believe it is urgent to investigate the fundamental issues underlying critical periods, and we have preliminary evidence that such understanding can be leveraged for improving semi-supervised and transfer learning algorithms. The fact that critical period phenomena involve information plasticity, rather than (biological) neural plasticity, suggests that we can conduct Artificial Neuroscience experiments, far simpler and cheaper than psychophysical experiments, before validating the observations in biology.less","540,686",2019,2022

This will leverage the 28 weather and climate model simulation contributions to the recently conducted multimodel physical processes experiment championed by the MJO TF and the GEWEX Atmospheric System Study (GASS) and organized in part by the proposal PIs. An early example of the type of results from this objective are shown in Figure 1. 2) Perform a detailed characterization and analysis of the multi-scale interactions between the MJO, CCKW and the local diurnal cycle of precipitation over MC using observation-based data sets and numerical simulations. We propose to investigate CCKW propagation over the MC, including the diurnal cycle of precipitation along CCKW trajectories and the influence from local ocean-atmosphere coupling processes. The key outcome of this objective is to address the importance of the multi-scale and air-sea interactions for the propagation of CCKW in various phases of the MJO and ability of weather/climate models to account for these processes. 3) Utilize the new WCRP-WWRP Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Project reforecast/forecast database to quantify the forecast skill of propagating atmospheric wave phenomena across the MC, putting it in a context with an associated estimate of predictability, and taking into account the findings from the abovetwo study tasks.

0,Efficient cold molecular ion production for the study of quantum coherence and dipolar interactions in a molecular ion trap,United States Department of the Army,to Eric Hudson,"Presently atomic, molecular, and optical physics is in a transitionary period. Techniques developed over the last 25 years have made it possible gain complete quantum control of atoms. Currently, a large part of the field is shifting from learning how to control atoms to using the controlled atoms for applications in quantum computation/simulation, quantum sensing, metrology, and test of fundamental physics. In parallel with this shift, another part of the field is beginning to focus on learning to control diatomic molecules at the quantum level. It is believed, and already beginning to be seen, that the revolution that occurred when atoms were bought under control by e.g. laser cooling, could happen again with molecular systems. The complex internal structure of molecules offers a host of opportunities for quantum computation/simulation, quantum chemistry, and test of fundamental physics. Like atomic physics of 25 years ago, the techniques to control molecules are just beginning to be demonstrated, e.g. laser-cooling of diagonal diatomic molecules and association of ultracold atoms. In the last five years, the study of ultracold molecular ions has emerged as a new discipline within this effort to bring molecules under control. It is now clear that a trapped sample of ultracold molecular ions affords many of the benefits of ultracold neutral molecules, while significantly reducing experimental complexity Ð e.g. large trap depths, long trap lifetimes, and efficient detection. Despite the infancy of the field, there is already a clear path to a wide range of important studies, including the investigation of quantum chemistry, precision measurement of molecular transitions, and the implementation of scalable quantum computation architecture. Under our previous ARO Grant (Understanding molecular ion Ð neutral atom collisions for the production of ultracold molecular ions; W911NF-11-1-0524; October 1, 2011 Ð September 30, 2014), we performed a series of experiments aimed at understanding the collisional physics between ultracold neutral atoms and molecular ions. This work resulted in several important observations of cold atom-ion photochemistry that were among the first of their kind, and have helped to open the field of cold atom-ion chemistry. In addition to these reactivity studies, we also developed tools for analyzing trapped molecular ions and recording their spectra, as well as solved several longstanding problems regarding trapped ion ÒthermodynamicsÓ. Finally, using the results of all of this work, we demonstrated that both the vibrational and external degrees of freedom of trapped molecular ions are efficiently cooled by sympathetic cooling collisions with laser-cooled atoms. Thus, through our previous ARO support, we have developed many of the necessary tools and techniques to help open the field of ultracold molecular ion research. Under this proposed ARO award, we will continue developing these techniques to realize efficient sympathetic cooling and trapping of molecular ions and probe the resulting ultracold molecular ionsÕ quantum coherence and interaction properties. Though the proposed work is novel and aggressive, we emphasize that it builds on techniques proposed and already developed in our laboratory. As a result, our laboratory is currently well suited to answer these important questions and to help open the field of ultracold molecular ions.less","527,775",2015,2018

0,Learning Probability Distributions over Structured Spaces,United States Department of the Navy,to Adnan Darwiche,"Project Summary/Abstract This proposal is concerned with the learning of probability distributions over structured spaces. Such distributions arise in a variety of real world applications, including speech recognition, video/image interpretation, configuration problems, diagnostics systems, and when reasoning about user preferences. In each of these applications, one may have a set of logical constraints that define the “physics” of the corresponding situation, therefore limiting the space of valid configurations in the probability space. This space of valid configurations is what we call a structured space, and the interest is in inducing and learning distributions over such structured spaces (i.e., distributions that are guaranteed to assign a zero probability to every configuration that is outside the structured space). The proposal is based on the main observation that such logical constraints are typically ignored by existing learning formalisms, which can lead to a sub-optimal performance of the learned distributions. The proposal is also based on a recent discovery, known as the Probabilistic Sentential Diagram (PSDD), which can be used to systematically induce distributions over structured spaces. The proposal aims to advance the PSDD and mature it into a domain-independent tool for machine learning that can be used by the broad community. This includes the learning of PSDD parameters and structures; the development of normalized methods for generating the constraints that define structured probability spaces; the efficient compilation of these constraints into PSDD structures; and the integration of these constraints with independence constraints that are prevalent in existing machine learning formalisms, such as probabilistic graphical models.less","510,000",2016,2017

The real-time physical optimization approach mechanically embodies how artificial neural networks mathematically learn to map inputs to desired outputs. To create the new design paradigm, we will first leverage simulation and experimentation to learn what aspects of active metamaterials affect their mechanical learning capabilities and why. We will then use this new knowledge to guide the design, fabrication, and demonstration of an active micro-scale metamaterial that applies mechanical learning to design a passive metamaterial that achieves a desired set of bulk behaviors. The proposed research will produce a greater understanding of the fundamental principles that govern how the process of learning can be achieved mechanically, which, if successfully understood, could uncover some of nature’s secrets relating to how real brains leverage physical matter to enable or enhance learning. Moreover, this research will produce the first multi-functional material that has ever been designed using another material, and the material will be designed without human intervention or insight. The proposed design approach will enable the rapid design of multi-functional materials of critical importance to the US air force while immediately and simultaneously considering all the relevant effects experienced by the actual material (e.g., nonlinearities, hysteresis, friction, dynamic behaviors, fabrication tolerances and errors, and viscoelastic, plastic, or other complex mechanical or thermal effects).

Mattis stated that artificial intelligence (AI) may change the ""fundamental nature of,war"". Soon humans will routinely collaborate with and ""teach"" AI domain knowledge to complement and extend AI's models. Focused on t,he common pattern searching tasks (e.g., mining intelligence from geospatial data), this proposal investigates methods to extract kn,owledge from human interaction with AI, e.g., cost-effectively annotating domain-specific concepts that lead to the classification o,f a pattern and learning how humans search for such p,riven statistical models that function as ""black boxes"", making it almost impossible for non-computing domain experts to comprehend,or control how AI automates a task, thus limiting how AI can assist humans in real-world settings.Prior Art: Considering human-AI co,llaboration as a bidirectional communication problem, prior work (e.g., DARPA's XAI program) mainly focused on making AI comprehensi,ble (AI to human), while making relatively less progress on the other direction (human to AI): humans often provide only a single la,bel for the training data and rely on AI to ""reverse-engineer"" the underlying human knowledge, at times causing biases and errors wh,en such knowledge is misrepresented.Objective & Technical Approaches: Focused on a common task for knowledge workersfinding certain, patterns from a large amount of data, I propose methods that extract two types of knowledge from human interaction with AI to compl, to cost-effectively annotate domain-specific concepts that serve as knowledge for identifying a pattern and further for AI to disco,ver new concepts using building blocks from a library of pre-defined concepts in similar domains;(ii) The ""how'' knowledge (how to f,ind such a pattern): I will develop a computational representation of humans' pattern searching task, formulate ""perceived importanc,e""a metric to capture the underlying knowledgethat is computed via a log analysis of user input, investigate methods that restruct,ure an existing task to elicit humans' expression of knowledge, and compare different approaches to incorporate such knowledge into,an AI's model.Future Navy Relevance: AI will play an increasingly important role in the future success of the US Navy and enabling h,umans to collaborate with AI is the key to operationalize the ever advances of AI. This project's outcome will contribute to human-A,I collaboration in pattern searching tasks with a direct implication on the Navyfor example, as geospatial intelligence becomes inc,reasing critical in various Naval operations, AI that can learn from human analysts can leverage their strategy (""how"" knowledge) to, automate portions of their tasks, alleviate their workload, and produce more timely and comprehensive intelligence.PI Qualification,: With over a decade of experience in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (40+ publications, four award-winning papers), I am,able to employ a suite of HCI methods as the right ""ingredients"" needed to solve the proposed research problems.

However deep-learning in supercomputers requires significant human programing efforts and consumes tremendous energy, which fundamentally restrains supercomputers from deep-learning efficiently in real-time, and limits the developments of intelligent systems such as self-piloted unmanned aerial vehicles (SPUAVs) with self-control in erratic complex environments. By contrast, the brain performs deep-learning in analog parallel mode via multilevel neural networks, and facilitates real-time learning with an energy efficiency more than five orders of magnitude superior to that of the supercomputers. Research Approach: We propose to develop a multi-layer self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuit (MLSNIC) based on synaptic resistors and neuristors developed in our lab to emulate the deep-learning functions of the neural networks. With their parallel signal processing and real-time learning functions, the neuromorphic networks can self-program their algorithms, and operate with an energy efficiency more than six orders of magnitude superior to that of the supercomputers. To achieve the goal, we will (1) integrate the devices in a large-scale MLSNIC to emulate a biological neuronal network with its critical functions such as high-speed parallel signal processing, hierarchical self-programming, and real-time deep learning with a low-power consumption; (2) develop a general theoretical platform to establish MLSNIC; (3) benchmark the intelligent functions of MLSNIC in autonomous control, real-time deep-learning, and selfprogramming to navigate a SPUAV in erratic complex environments.

To support these requirements, wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) have received a lot of attention because of self deployment and reconfiguration properties. Unfortunately, wireless networks in mobile environments face formidable challenges - from radio propagation effects to external jamming, path breakage and intermittent connectivity. Current radio platforms are not adequate for the challenge. One approach is to wait for more sophisticated radios (eg, MIMO, cooperative radios, SDR’s) that will alleviate the problem using strictly physical layer techniques. Another approach, successfully explored in Phase I of this project, is to use network and transport layer methods, like path redundancy, network coding and erasure coding to make the network more robust. In Phase II we will leverage Phase I lessons to integrate both physical (eg JTRS), and network/transport techniques to provide more options and achieve better gains. A special middle-ware, the ""thin layer”, will manage this integration, transparently interacting with all other layers. The thin layer manages the layer specific ""redundancies"".

This technique uses the lowest transmitted power and attains the highest bit-rate efficiency of all techniques that are used to obtain high SFDR. The proposed SSB-SC transmitter is a photonic circuit ring laser oscillator that outputs only sideband optical power (that may be filtered to SSB only).

0,Multi-view scene representations and their computational architectures,United States Department of the Navy,to Stefano Soatto,"Visual representations are functions of (past) images of a scene (training set) that are “useful” to answer questions about it once future images (test set) become available. The project casts the design and analysis of visual representations in terms of basic principles of statistical decision theory and information theory, where “useful” is measured in terms of reduction of the uncertainty of questions about the scene. “Questions” can pertain to a decision or classification task (detection, localization, recognition, categorization of objects) or to a control task, where the “answer” belongs to the continuum (in which direction to move?). Such basic principles include sufficiency, minimality, invariance, and completeness. The analysis of existing schemes within the context of such a framework would enable comparing existing schemes beyond the mere empirical test of a given algorithm on a given dataset. This would allow the engineer to understand and predict performance, by highlighting the conditions under which a given algorithm is expected to perform to specification. Furthermore, it would allow not just comparing, but improving existing schemes, by instantiating better approximations of ideal representations. Preliminary evidence points to the fact that simple changes to existing popular descriptors, such as SIFT, suggested by the analysis, yield significant performance improvements. The theory suggests that the size of the domain of “receptive fields” should be decoupled from the “scale” of the descriptor, which at first sight seems to go counter to the teaching of harmonic analysis and scale-space theory. Such theory, however, was developed in support of compression and storage tasks, whereas the task in vision is not to reproduce the source signal, but to perform decisions based on it, where the data has been corrupted by intrinsically non-linear nuisance factors such as occlusions. The project intends to extend “domain-size pooling” to other forms of descriptors, from deformable parts models to convolutional neural networks. The proposal also formulates conjectures on the properties of such networks that, if validates, could help explain their recent empirical success, as well as highlight potential limitations. The work plan is articulated into 11 tasks, that range from the purely analytical (making some of the formal arguments articulated in the proposal rigorous) to the applied (making the implementation of DSPSIFT efficient and publicly available). The scientific significance stems from placing the task of designing or learning representations into established analytical frameworks, which enables both understanding commonly practice methods in relation to each other, and improving them by attempting to improve the approximation of the optimal representation, which is intractable for most cases. The proposal operates under the assumptions of the Lambert-Ambient (LA) model, that stipulates that most of the scene can be approximated as Lambertian, and that surfaces are piecewise smooth and multiply connected. While simplistic, this model is far more complex than that implicitly assumed by most existing descriptors, as pointed out in the proposal. It is also the simplest model that captures the phenomenology of image formation, including occlusions and scaling phenomena. The proposal builds on results of prior ONR effort on the detection of “detachable objects,” defined as subsets of the image domain that back-project onto portions of the scene that are partially surrounded by the medium. As articulated in the proposal, occlusions force the representation to be the union of local regions, and detachable objects inform how to re-assemble objects from such local regions. It is expected that the integration of this effort with detachable objects will come to fruition towards the end of the project in a natural manner, leading to better models of the scene for the purpose of visual decision and control tasks.less","491,360",2016,2017
0,A compact continuous matter wave accelerometer,United States Department of the Navy,to Paul Hamilton,"A compact continuous matter wave accelerometerAccelerometers based on matter wave interferometers are typically complex devices requiring alarge volume to accommodate the free fall of atoms and complicated systems to control multiplelasers for cooling, interferometry, and detection. The most sensitive devices use pulsed atomicfountains which have significant dead time and low bandwidth. In this proposal we willimplement a proposed method based on optical detection of Bloch oscillations using ytterbiumatoms trapped in an intracavity optical lattice. Demonstration of this technique will pave the waytowards a simple, compact, continuous, and high sensitivity accelerometer. Compared to otheratomic accelerometers which measure a phase, this sensor has the added benefit that it directlyconverts an acceleration into a continuously measurable frequency. This has clear advantagesfor inertial navigation. Light pulse interferometers also suffer from aliasing of vibrationscommensurate with the pulse separation time. The ability to make a continuous measurementwill eliminate this source of technical noise. Finally, the proposed sensor protocol is simple ~laser cooled atoms are loaded into an optical lattice and the output light of the optical cavity iscontinuously recorded.This proposal will extend the PI~s postdoctoral work demonstrating the first optical cavity basedatom interferometer. Traditional atomic fountain interferometers have improved sensitivity byincreasing the duration of free fall, with lengths now up to 10 meters. Further increases presentsevere engineering challenges. Using atoms trapped in an intracavity optical lattice addressesthis in a scalable manner. Even though the effective separation of the interferometer arms is halfan optical wavelength, trapping the atoms allows much longer coherence times. For example thephase difference in an interferometer with ytterbium atoms, trapped and separated by a singlesite in a 532 nm optical lattice, held for T = 5 second, is 40,000 radians. Shot noise limiteddetection of this phase due to gravitational potential energy between lattice sites for 1,000,000atoms gives better than a part per million sensitivity in a single measurement. Coherence timesin optical lattices for over ten seconds have been demonstrated while an equivalent free fallwould require a 500 meter apparatus!While the demonstration in this proposal will utilize an apparatus typical in size for laser coolingexperiments, there is a very clear path towards miniaturization since the actual interferometryregion will be less than a cubic millimeter. An atom chip trap with integrated optical cavityoptics could push the size to cubic centimeter scales. Ultimately one could imagine using highfinesse optical fiber cavities for a truly compact multi-axis sensor.less","490,934",2017,2020

0,A NEW DESIGN OF VERTICAL THIN FILM TRANSISTORS FOR HIGHLY FLEXIBLE ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRONIC SKIN,United States Department of the Navy,to Xiangfeng Duan,"Flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs) are of central importance for diverse electronic and particularly macroelectronic applications. The current TFTs using organic or inorganic thin film semiconductors are usually limited by either poor electrical performance or insufficient mechanical flexibility. Here we propose a new design of highly flexible vertical TFTs (VTFTs) with superior electrical performance and mechanical robustness. By using the graphene as a work-function tunable contact for semiconductor thin films, the vertical current flow across the graphene-semiconductor junction can be effectively modulated by an external gate potential to enable VTFTs with a high on-off ratio. The concept of VTFTs can offer several combined advantages not readily possible in conventional planar TFTs. First, with the design of graphene-semiconductor heterostructure based VTFTs, the ultra-short channel transistors (typically <100 nm as determined by the thickness of the semiconductor thin film rather than by lithography) can be readily created by using low resolution lithography to afford a delivering current greatly exceeding that of the conventional planar TFTs. Second, the vertical (out-of-plane) charge transport across the large area vertical junction makes the source-drain current much less affected by the in-plane cracks in the semiconductor thin films to afford unprecedented tolerance to in-plane cracks. The unique vertical transistor architecture can therefore enable ultra-short channel devices with very high delivering current and exceptional mechanical flexibility. Within this proposal, we will evaluate and optimize the frequency response of such VTFTs by exploring different semiconductor thin films with variable band offset and/or film thickness, with a goal to demonstrate 10-GHz transistors/circuits using 10-?m resolution lithography; we will develop solution processable VTFTs for highly flexible integrated electronics over large area plastic substrate; and we will further develop a conductive micro-structure air gap dielectric to integrate with the VTFTs for the creation of highly sensitive electronic skin for static and dynamic pressure mapping/tracking. The unique design of VTFTs simultaneously addresses two most critical challenges (low delivering current and insufficient mechanical flexibility) of conventional planar inorganic TFTs and can enable a new generation highly flexible electronics with exceptional electrical performance and mechanical robustness. The device structure and the fabrication approach is intrinsically scalable and can be readily extended to a wide range of semiconductor thin films, including the solution processable ones, to enable a low-temperature, low cost process to high performance VTFTs on a plastic substrate. It can therefore define a new pathway to high performance macroelectronics, and impact broad areas of existing applications and enable a wide array of flexible, wearable, degradable or disposable electronic systems for computing, sensing/monitoring, communication, storage, displays, and more. The integration of the VTFTs with unique conductive microstructure air gap dielectric can enable a new generational electronic skin with unprecedented sensitivity, flexibility and robustness.less","480,194",2016,2017
0,Crosslinked PVDF Terpolymers and Nanocomposites,United States Department of the Navy,to Qibing Pei,"ABSTRACT:The demand for high-performance energy-storage devices is rapidly growing thanks to increasing deployments of advanced electronics, electric vehicles, and power systems. Among the various electrical energy-storage devices, polymer thin-film capacitors possess the combined advantages of high power density, mechanical flexibility, and low-cost large-area processability.They are already used in certain electronic devices and power systems. The state-of-the-art capacitor films represented by bi-axially oriented polypropylene exhibit high charge-discharge efficiency. However, its energy density is rather low, limited by the low dielectric constants of the polymers. Since capacitors can take up more than 25% of the volume and weight of electric power systems, increasing the energy density of the thin-film capacitors would directly translate into reduction of the volume and weight of the power systems.Poly(vinylidene difluoride)-based polymers, are among the best known polymers with high dielectric constants. Relaxor ferroelectric poly(vinylidene difluoride) terpolymers are particularly interesting for high-energy-density thin-film capacitors thanks to their relatively low polarization hysteresis and dielectric loss. Moreover, these polymers have also been suggested for otherimportant applications including solid state cooling, non-volatile memory, and electromechanical transduction. However, the terpolymers also exhibit critical problems including a low glasstransition temperature which leads to high dielectric loss and rapid failure at elevated temperatures.Nanocomposites incorporating high dielectric nanoparticles have been extensively investigated to further increase the dielectric constant and thus energy density of the terpolymers. However, the increased dielectric loss and diminished breakdown field strength often overwhelm the gain in dielectric constant.We propose an integrative approach to synthesizing poly(vinylidene difluoride) terpolymer nanocomposite with chemically modified polymer matrix and uniformly dispersed nanoparticles.The introduction of chemical modification to the polymer structure will facilitate spontaneous polarization to lower the hysteresis loss of the polymer matrix. It also enhances the thermal stability of the polymer and lowers the dielectric loss at elevated temperatures. The nanoparticle fillers will be introduced using an innovative chemical approach to effect uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles at high loading content and suppress aggregation-induced dielectric loss anddielectric breakdown. The project aims to demonstrate dielectric nanocomposite films with high dielectric constant, high breakdown field strength, low charging/discharging loss across a broad temperature range, and high energy density.The project will also investigate electrode materials that can be applied over large areas of the nanocomposite films at low cost, can enhance fault tolerance to increase the long term operational stability of the thin film capacitors. The new materials will be further investigated and modified as necessary for other DoD-important applications including thermal and electromechanical devices.The proposed research should lay the scientific foundation for the synthesis of dielectric composites with high-volume loading and uniform-distribution of nanoparticles. It will experimentally validate the synthetic approach to provide a new generation of dielectric materials for high density energy storage and high-power discharging. The scientific approach could be adapted for the development of new composites with far reaching applications for the national security and defense.less","465,564",2019,2022

0,Voltage Control of Magnetism in THz Regime via Magnon-Phonon Coupling,United States Department of the Army,to Gregory Carman,"There is currently a high level of interest in using magnetic systems in the THz regime for applications like transduction, electronic filtering, and logic. However there are two main problems prohibiting advancement in this field. The first is a lack of fundamental knowledge concerning magnon/phonon coupling at THz frequencies. The second problem, related to the first, is that traditional ferromagnetic systems have a frequency response limited to the low GHz range. To address both of these problems, we propose to investigate a class of magnetoelastic antiferromagnetic materials that offer THz operations using voltage-induced strains provided by a piezoelectric layer, i.e. phonons to control magnons. Specifically, we intend to fabricate nanoscale magnetoelastic antiferromagnetic elements onto thin piezoelectric films. A dynamic voltage applied to the piezoelectric material produces THz strain oscillations in the antiferromagnetic elements causing magnetic reorientation attributable to magnon/phonon interaction. This new approach provides an energy efficient technique to reorient magnetic states at THz frequencies essential for future applications. In this proposal, we present a three-step plan to understand the dynamic magnetoelastic response of a heterogeneous antiferromagnetic material. The plan consists of 1) fundamental modeling, 2) material development, and 3) testing/evaluation of a strain-mediated voltage- controlled heterogeneous antiferromagnetic material. The proposal relies on an experimental program that is informed by sophisticated modeling rather than following a Òmake-it-and-test-itÓ approach. Developing a new magnetoelastic antiferromagnetic material is outside the scope of this proposal, rather we focus on evaluating the dynamic response of existing materials with known magnetoelastic coupling. One such material is the y-phase AFM alloy Fe50Mn50 producing giant magnetostriction (800 ppm) at room temperature. Finally, the testing phase consists of two components: 1) sophisticated national lab-based testing to evaluate spin states with atomic specificity, and 2) university-based benchtop testing to demonstrate picosecond reorientation. The proposed research represents one of the first investigations into the magnon/phonon coupling behavior at THZ frequencies using antiferromagnetic materials. Understanding the complex dynamics through modeling, fabrication and testing provides a clear path to explore fundamental physics in the context of new and interesting application spaces. Namely, the research proposed here will enable 1) new classes of THz electronic devices and 2) new computational methods verified with experiments, and 3) a fundamental THz magnon/phonon interactions.

Therefore, it is not surprising that governments have announced stricter and str,icter regulations on AI such as the famous ``General Data Protection Regulation'' in EU.

We?ll produce artificially created data sets that remove individua,l information but still retain similar statistical information as the raw data sets. Despite numerous synthesis algorithms, we still, lack a theoretical understanding of how the generation of synthetic data affects the utility of downstream machine learning tasks.,This motivates us to develop statistical learning framework for the analysis of synthetic data. Machine learning algorithms are wide,ly integrated into high-stakes decision making processes, such as in job application and criminal prediction. However, empirical stu,dies have shown that most existing algorithms focus on performance, retaining or even amplifying implicit unfairness in historical d,ata.

Neural network verification methods are designed to test whether the behavior of a model is provably consistent with certain user-specified properties suchas robustness. Further, training with the bounds provided by neural network verification can lead to networks with certified properties, such as certified robustness. Despite being an important research area in the past four years and having successfully applied to verify small networks (e.g., ACAS Xu airborne collision avoidance models, MNIST/CIFAR models), the current approaches have limited scalability and are not flexible enough to handle general neural network architectures and realistic specifications. Further, current approaches need to re-derive and re-implement the verification methods when handing new architectures, making them hard to applywithout sufficient knowledge in neural network verification.

0,Integrating AOG and DNN for Human Activity by Learning from Small Examples,United States Department of the Army,to Song-Chun Zhu,"Objective. We propose to develop a unified framework for integrating hierarchical compositional And-Or Graph (AOG) models and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for human activities understanding in videos. The new representation will enable learning complex knowledge about human activities (3D poses, attributes, actions. interactions with contextual objects, and causal effects of actions etc.) from small examples through interactive Query-Answer (QA). The unified framework will achieve the following three properties: (i) Combining the strengths and benefits of DNN and AOG. AOG is a hierarchical and compositional graph with interpretable nodes representing explicitly the spatial decomposition of human body in parts and their kinematic dependencies, the temporal decomposition of activity in actions and interactions with objects, and the causal relations between actions and object status (i.e., fluents) changes. We further augment the AOG by associating attributes with nodes at all levels of the hierarchy: appearance attributes for dressing styles and geometric attributes for concurrent actions. The DNNs are known to have rich features, though mostly implicit and not directly interpretable, which leads to improved performance on complex data through end-to-end training. (ii) Learning from small examples through weakly supervised learning and QA. We will disentangle the nodes in DNN by imposing some regularization terms to make the nodes more interpretable, and thus make tight and sparse connections between the DNN nodes and AOG nodes. The improved interpretability will enable semantically meaningful communications between the nodes in the representation and human users, and thus we can grow the AOG to represent complex knowledge. (iii) Effective inference and information fusion. Technical Approach. The proposed work can be divided in three tasks: (i) Task 1: Integrating AOG and DNN with bottom-up and top-down inference. Given an image or short video, the output for activity understanding is a parse graph whose nodes are derived from the AOG and grounded on DNN features. Each node in the parse graph (its score or log-probability) is contributed by a, §, y-processes, and the weights of these processes vary due to occlusion, small resolution and hidden fluents. It is crucial to have the right credits/penalty assignment during the training stage for the success and failure among these pathways. (ii) Task 2: Learning human object interaction and object fluents change. In most daily activities excluding some sports and dance, human actions are goal-guided to changing certain fluent of some objects in the scene. Therefore we will model human object interactions, track the objects under manipulation, and detect the changing fluent. More specifically we will train generative AOG + DNN model to represent the object change of appearance (e.g. pushing a button to turn it on), geometry (i.e. blowing a balloon), and topology (i.e. cutting an apple). (iii) Task 3: Tightly coupling AOG and DNN and learning through weakly supervised QA. In contrast to simply channeling DNN feature to AOG nodes, we impose new loss functions to disentangle DNN nodes and to make them more interpretable and tightly coupled with the nodes at multiple levels (granularity). Then we will grow the AOG to add new concepts encountered in video by QA and weakly supervised learning. The QA will utilize contextual information, such as ""what is the left hand is touching"". Outcome and Impact. The proposed work has immediate impacts on a range of DoD missions, including persistent ISR in video surveillance and information gathering, fusion and retrieval. To support these applications, we target a range of domain tasks (i) Joint 2D/3D human pose, parts and attribute recognition on large-scale datasets; (ii) Joint inference of actions and object fluent changes; and (iii) Inferring the underlying tasks and goals of the humans in video and predicting next actions.less","449,998",2018,2021

In a number of systems, it was shown that neurons transmit information at rates approaching physical limits, reaching near optimal performance when signals detected have a statistical structure that reflects the outside world. Prior studies of information transmission in the auditory system were mostly done in vivo. We propose rather to isolate the sensory epithelia and study the transmission of auditory information in vitro. We aim to apply mechanical stimulation directly to one hair cell bundle, while performing electrophysiological measurements on the cell soma, and on the innervating neurons. Our goal is to determine the information content in hair bundle response, somatic response, as well as that of the auditory nerve fibers. Further, we aim to understand how information from multiple hair cells is integrated, in systems that exhibit convergent innervation.less","446,052",2019,2022
0,A Biomimetic Approach to Designing Functional Structures with Nanoscale Precision,United States Department of the Navy,to Yu Huang,"Controlling the morphology and assembly of nanomaterials with high precision has always been a focus of fundamental research and applied studies due to the strong size- and morphology-dependence of properties at nanoscale. Using biomolecules to exploit small energy differences based on surface bonding or molecular adsorption biological systems can gain control in most aspects of the material formation process, obtaining superior functions unseen in artificial materials. However, the limited molecular-level understanding of the specific interactions between biomolecules and materials and their influence on the material growth physics pose the main challenges in successful translation of biomimetic principles to in vitro engineering of material structures with nanoscale precision and high functionality. In this project, we propose to understand these fundamental challenges through theoretical and ex-situ and insitu experimental studies, and to formulate globally applicable biomimetic principles that can guide the production of (nano) material structures with predictable morphology and composition to deliver superior functionality. Pt-Ni nanocatalyst, wherein a small change in the morphology or the atomic arrangement near the surface can lead to significant property modification, will serve as an initial model system to refine molecular-surface interactions in order to achieve structures with optimal performance. First the phage display library will be used against Pt-Ni alloy nanocrystal surfaces to screen for specific binding sequences. The sequences will be closely examined and tested in ex-situ synthesis of Pt-Ni nanocrystals to further pin-point the binding motifs within each sequence. Further binding information can be inferred from molecular dynamics simulation which will be carried out by our established collaborators. The simulations can offer clues to understand and design binding molecules and construct crystal growth models which can lead to the production of Pt-Ni nanocrystals with predictable structure and surface atomic ordering. Measurements of catalytic activity and atomic scale structural characterizations will be used to validate and improve our hypotheses and theoretical models. And in situ observations of Pt-Ni nanocrystal growth under the influence of surface specific molecules will be used to obtain direct evidence for the mechanisms underlying nanoparticle crystallization as well as dynamic information that provide constraints on important energetic parameters not available through ex situ methods. It is expected that the successful execution of the proposed studies will provide unprecedented control over nanocrystal formation in the Pt-Ni system and beyond. Understanding the mechanisms of biomolecule-directed process of material formation will benefit the design of multivariate intelligence systems, bio-derived energy systems, and biomimetic structural applications. It has the potential to open up many new avenues in scientific discoveries and technological applications, and to bring great impacts on technologies ranging from sensors, chemical production and clean energy generation to environmental protection.. Specifically for Navy, the success of the proposal may contribute to areas such as biominearal assisted CO2 sequestration and photocatalytic breakdown of organic pollutants in sea water.less","444,168",2016,2018

Specifically, to avoid direct lithography on the delicate 2DSC surface, we will fabricate the entire gate stack and contact electrodes on a sacrificial substrate and physically transfer them onto 2DSC with minimum damage within dielectric/2DSC interface and metal/2DSC interface.Approach:To overcome previous limitations and achieve superior RF performance, here wepropose a novel approach to fabricate MoS2 transistors with sub-100 nm gate length using a metal/dielectric stack as the self-aligned top gate, and van der Waal transferred metal as the self-aligned source drain electrodes, both of which are integrated with MoS2 through a physical assembly process without damaging the gentle and dedicate two-dimensional semiconductor (2DSC) surface. In particular, the physical assembly and vdW integration of both gate stack and contact electrodes avoid any direct aggressive processes on MoS2 to prevent any integration-induced damage to the atomically thin 2DSCs, thus ensuring pristine 2DSC/dielectric interface with little trapping states and excellent channel mobility, and nearly ideal metal/semiconductor interface essentially free of interface Fermi level pinning and with minimized contact resistance. The self-aligned source-drain electrodes minimize the access resistance and parasitic capacitance and maximize the device transconductance.

0,Crowdsourcing Assessments and Evaluations,United States Department of the Navy,to Mihaela van der Schaar,"Statement of Work:In many operation settings, the performance (or ability, experience, knowledge, productivity, etc.) of an agent(professionals, researchers, authors etc.) cannot be easily assessed by an objective ~test~ but rather must be inferred from the reports or evaluations of other agents. In such settings, it is necessary or convenient that the evaluation process be ~crowdsourced~. However, crowdsourcing systems for evaluations/assessments often do not operate well because ~peer~ evaluations may be unreliable for any of a number of reasons: the evaluator may be malicious or incompetent or may simply not exert sufficient effort to provide an accurate assessment because effort is not rewarded.To ensure that crowdsourcing systems for evaluations/assessments work well it is necessary to identify high quality (accurate) feedback and to provide incentives for evaluators to provide such feedback, and in particular, to encourage effort and cooperative behavior and discourage low quality feedback due to limited effort spent, incompetence ormalicious behavior. The goal of this project is to construct a system for crowdsourcing assessments that can operate in many different communities/types of agents in an efficient, fair and robust manner. The theory and the associated constructions willneed to enable us to deal with the incentive problems posed by assessments in a large variety of communities of professionals, including communities consisting of a large number of anonymous, heterogeneous (have different needs, preferences, capabilities, information etc.) agents, and in which the peers have heterogeneous ability and evaluations are (known to be) imperfect.Objective:The object of this research is to develop formalisms, methods and an associated ~crowdsourcing~ platform foreffectively performing evaluations/assessments using other peers. The methods developed will be very widelyapplicable in many scenarios, including those mentioned above ~ indeed to almost all settings in which the quality of the work of an individual is subjective, or cannot be directly tested or easily observed/evaluated by the authority ~ but can be observed/evaluated by peers.Approach:In this project the PI aims to develop a systematic framework for modeling the problem of crowdsourcing assessments, a theory for analyzing it, methods for solving it, algorithms for designing and implementing it and a prototype for validating it. Typically, evaluations require costly effort and do not convey direct benefit. This will mean that, in the absence of incentives, evaluators will not want to put in the effort needed to evaluate others. However, as mentioned previously, evaluators are in turn evaluated by others (not necessarily those that they evaluated), so social reciprocity can be used in the design of the crowdsourcing platform for assessments in such a way that if the evaluator does exert effort and provides an accurate evaluation, then he/she can be rewarded for this effort in the form of being assigned better evaluators in the future; this is desirable (at least for agents who produce good work) because better evaluatorsproduce more accurate assessments of quality and also because it is believed that the quality of an agent as a worker will improve if he/she receives high quality evaluations. A succinct way to keep track of the evaluator~s history of past assessments and their qualities is through a rating/reputation system. The rating will be used to reward/punish agentsthrough the assignment of better/worse sets of evaluators.Overall Merit and ONR Mission/Relevance:Providing high quality, competent and truthful assessments of the work performed by various agents - the ~agents~ may be individuals or teams of individuals ~ is of paramount importance for the well-functioning of any organization and/or operation, including the Navy and/or Naval operations.

0,Parallel Optimization with Input Delays,United States Department of the Navy,to Wotao Yin,"Technological advances in data gathering have led to a rapid proliferation of big data in diverse areas. In order to make sense of this massive amount of data, new computational approaches are needed for scientists and engineers to analyze their data and make decisions. Owing much to the key roles that `1 and other nonsmooth functions play in the areas of statistical and machine learning, neural network training, and image processing, nonsmooth optimization hasbecome a common type of problem in data sciences. With the increasing number of researchers using nonsmoothoptimization in their research, there is a pressing need for solvers that can handle a difficult, important subclass ofproblem: nonsmooth nonseparable optimization.Nonsmooth nonseparable functions (including the indicator functions corresponding to global constraints) arise in avariety of optimization problems: linear and second-order cone programming, the recovery of tree/graph/transformedsparsesignals, and distributed consensus problems. Improved ability for solving large-scale and distributed instancesof these problems will translate to more rapid, accurate information processing and decision making, which areimportant for the Navy applications.The PI proposes a project that focuses on solving a set of large-scale optimization problems that are possibly bothnonsmooth and nonseparable. This proposal encompasses two aspects:(1) Development of parallel algorithms for nonsmooth nonseparable optimization;(2) Development of asynchronous parallel algorithms and their convergence theory.New decomposition methods, coordinate-friendly structures, analysis of iterations with input delays, and an opensourcepackage that implement the algorithms in (1) and (2), will be introduced.Significance and impact. Current state of the art methods have been shown to be inefficient or inapplicable when anonsmooth nonseparable function is introduced to optimization. Hence, modeling big data problems using nonsmoothnonseparable functions has been avoided. While many algorithms have been developed for nonsmooth problems,their efficiency is tied to the separability of the nonsmooth functions. By providing easy-to-use methods, the PI willexpand the solvable problem formulations beyond the typical nonsmooth separable functions such as `1 norm andconstraints on individual (or non-overlapping groups of) variables. The proposed work opens the door for researchersto work on new problems.The developed algorithms will be realized as a computational toolbox and made available on GitHub. The toolboxallows researchers to solve a wide class of problems, to test and refine their theories, and to quickly involve students incurrent research problems. Moreover, the toolbox, which is open-course and well-documented, is extensible andactively developed. Other researchers can add their own features and algorithms to the toolbox.While the problems and algorithms are of great interest to a large scientific community, an expected outcome of thisproject will be the training of the next generation of computational scientists working in optimization-related fields.Researchers and students in mathematics, computer science, and engineering have the necessary background tolearn and use the results of this research. Thus, there is an opportunity to form cross-disciplinary research teams.Furthermore, by having a set of easily used computational tools, it is much easier for undergraduate students toparticipant in research projects through exploring specific examples or conducting numerical experiments.

The long-term goal is to develop a theory of information for decision and control, where complex sensors provide ""actionable information"" through analysis that explicitly takes into account large nuisance variability due to phenomena that affect the data, but are otherwise irrelevant to the task at hand. Specifically, this project focuses on the analysis and inference of independently moving objects or ""agents"", where the relations between the different objects is time-varying and explicitly modeled, which is a necessary step to enable interaction with complex and dynamic scenes. The first step is to extend visual inference tools developed for static scenes, to independently moving objects. Once independently moving objects are detected and their attributes inferred, the second step is to explicitly model thcir (time-varying) relations, so as to support queries and actions not just about object identities, bul also about their relations, including interrelations, actions and events. In some cases, the relation between sensory input and actions could be represented directly, without the need for a ""state"" or an explicit representation of the physical environment. Once the relation between objects (which may include ""agents"" as well as the environment itself) is abstracted, some simple tasks could be explicitly enumerated, and efficiently encoded. thus providing a representation not of the data, and not of the scene, but directly of the data-to-action maps.

While QCLs have become the sources of choice in these spectral regions, the only realistic option to attain hundred-watt power level with good beam quality is to coherently combine multiple QCL emitters into a single output beam. In Phase I, we have performed analysis of QCL arrays, and showed that this approach is well suited for necessary power scaling. We have developed a design, which should produce 10 W of output power at RT. In Phase II, we will develop the processing required for the fabrication of such arrays, fabricate and characterize prototype devices. We will design, fabricate, and characterize a second generation of devices with higher output power of several tens of watts. Furthermore, we will develop a plan for extending the performance of these arrays up to 100 W. Our approach, leveraging advanced material growth and fabrication, will result in robust, compact, and cost-effective monolithic QCL beam combining solutions exceeding the requirements of this solicitation, and provide the military with the required laser sources.less","400,478",2013,2015

0,8.3 Microbiology - Increased Translation Error Rates and Long-term Survival,United States Department of the Army,to Beth Lazazzera,"Quality control of accurate protein translation is governed by the specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), enzymes which are responsible for correct charging of tRNAs with their cognate amino acid. Loss of this quality control either through misincorporation or defective editing will result in ÒmistranslationÓ leading to a loss of protein structural and functional integrity. While mistranslation is normally rare, it has been recently observed that E. coli cells that lack the quality control function of an aaRS have a competitive advantage over wild-type cells under long-term survival conditions and that these quality control mutants have a higher mutation rate. To further probe this seemingly paradoxical phenomenon, this proposal seeks to determine how translation errors contribute to survival, whether translation errors directly influence the mutation rate and to assess the relative benefit of different translation errors. It is hypothesized that elevated translation errors improve survival during long-term growth (where the growth rate is considerably slowed relative to exponential phase) by increased translational capacity in the face of dwindling resources and/or by translation of a more diverse proteome. In editing-defective E. coli cells (containing a mutant PheRS leading to misincorporation of Tyr for Phe) grown under long term conditions, altered increased translation capacity will be assessed by the loss of metabolic and transcriptomic markers characteristic of the stringent response (which normally shuts down the translational machinery during amino acid starvation) and by polysome profiling which provides an indication of active 70S ribosomes associated with mRNA. To assess the presence of a more diverse proteome, mass spectrometry-based assays will be used to quantify the mistranslation level of targeted proteins known to have central roles in translation. To establish a possible link between mistranslation and higher mutation rates, editing defective cells will be assessed for an abundance of the GASP phenotype by competing aged versus younger cells grown through stationary phase. Overall mutational frequency and the mutational spectrum of editing-defective cells exhibiting a GASP phenotype will be assessed by genomic sequencing and compared against the sequence of a wild-type strain exhibiting the GASP phenotype. To determine if different translation errors are equally beneficial, a second editing-defective strain will be constructed (mutant of IleRS which should result in misincorporation of either Val or Leu for Ile) and assessed for its ability to compete with wild-type under long-term stationary phase. Overall mutational frequency will be determined and effects of a double mutant (editing defective alleles of IleRS and PheRS) will be assessed.less","390,000",2015,2018

0,Analysis of Network Evolution and Learning,United States Department of the Navy,to Mihaela van der Schaar,"A (large) network science literature studies networks that have already formed. A (smaller) microeconomics literature studies the formation of networks – but makes strong assumptions (e.g., homogeneous agents/entities, complete information about other agents) that are far from being met in reality. Neither the network science literature nor the microeconomics literature take into account that agents behave strategically in deciding what information to consume, produce and share (in addition to deciding what links to form/maintain/break) and that agents begin with incomplete information (about others). As a result, neither network science nor microeconomics provide a useful methodology for understanding, predicting and guiding the formation (and evolution) of real networks and the consequences of network formation. The overarching goal of this project is to develop such a methodology. The research will take into account that agents behave strategically and that they begin with incomplete information about each other and thus, must learn over time what information to produce and consume, and which connections to form and maintain and which to break. The approach is through social norms; the previous work demonstrated the usefulness of social norms to promote/regulate anonymous one-time interactions (such as exchange of services) on the web. A key goal of this project is to develop a systematic methodology for understanding how social norms affect (positively and negatively) the formation and functioning of informational networks as well as a theory and methods to develop social norms that lead agents to form networks with desired properties. Objective Learning and network formation are intertwined and this co-evolution is a central theme of the proposed research. The first objective is to determine how the process of learning about others directs the formation/evolution of the network and how in turn the formation/evolution of the network directs the process of learning. We will determine which network topologies emerge and persist and whether these network topologies are desirable. We will investigate the way in which learning (about others) interacts with the evolution of the network. Particular aspects that are important are the tradeoffs between direct and indirect connections, the complementarity of information and how all of this affects the evolution and structure of the network. The second objective is to determine the effects of strategic choices of agents and how social norms influence these choices and their consequences – both the choices of what links to form/break and also what information to produce and where to disseminate it and what information to acquire and from where. The PI will determine how social norms influence the topologies of networks that emerge and persist and which social norms promote social welfare (through the production and dissemination of the most useful quantity and variety of information) and learning. Approach The PI will model what agents learn about others in terms of reputation. Reputation evolves because knowledge arrives gradually and is noisy, and also because the network evolves as individuals form and break links. The PI will model the information process in terms of Brownian motion. This will capture the idea that information about agents is disseminated gradually and is intrinsically noisy. When agents have more links, more information is disseminated and learning is more rapid. Rapid learning is both good and bad: it is good because low quality or malicious agents can be quickly discovered and ostracized; it is bad because high quality agents may produce an unlucky string of bad signals and so be mistakenly thought to be bad and treated as such. The PI will address this tension; a specific approach is to determine how a network populated by agents with specific characteristics will evolve and whether the network that emerges will be optimal for these agents.less","384,569",2016,2016

This has led to an effort to apply these models to nonlinear partial differential equations with a range of applications in fluid dynamics, weather prediction, and complex dynamical systems. The goal of many of these research areas is to go to higher spatial resolution or farther in time using prior knowledge of the behavior of the system, rather than using higher resolution or longer time simulation with conventional methods for solving nonlinear PDE. This project will address problems in nonlinear dynamics for which direct numerical simulation (DNS) may not provide sufficient resolution to provide answers to fundamental problems in PDE and in related scientificproblems. We focus on formation and persistence of coherent multiscale structures such as finite or infinite time singularities.Thedynamics of the underlying DNS of a nonlinear PDE, especially in the case of finite time singularities or pattern forming dynamics, necessitate irregular time series observation. For example, in the case of finite time singularities, decreasing step size is needed as one approaches the formation of the coherent structure. Coarsening dynamics in phase separation is well-known to have power-law scaling, requiring adaptive time-stepping methods and resulting in irregular time intervals for changes of state of the solution. We propose to leverage novel heavy-ball neural ODE methods (Neurips 2021), designed for irregularly sampled time series data combined with graphical models for high dimensional data structures as are often required for DNS of grid refinement for nonlinear PDE.We propose some test problems for this research plan that will allow us to compare against recent results from the Fourier Neural Operator method based on pseudospectral direct numerical simulation. These test problems include a modified Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model that produces finite time singularities, a thin film equation that has known results showing that Fourier-based methods fail to capture the inner structure of singularities, and phase-field dynamics which are well-known to work well with spectral methods yet suffer from resolution problems when the diffuse interface parameter vanishes.

The project will analyze 12 years of historical radar data from the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR) in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada, which is an Arctic research facility at 83 degrees north magnetic latitude, deep in the polar cap. The incoherent scatter radar technique provides complete altitude profiles of electron density, electron temperature, ion temperature, and line-of-sight velocity. We will fit RISR electron densityprofiles for key shape parameters relevant to radio propagation forecasting, namely the peak electron density, layer height, bottomside shape parameters, and topside scale height. Analysis of these parameters will be used to address the following questions: 1) How do the electron density profile shape parameters in polar cap density structures vary with geomagnetic conditions? 2) How do the electron density profile shape parameters relate to other properties of the ionospheric plasma, such as plasma temperatures and convection velocities? 3) How do observations of electron density profiles compare to existing models (e.g. SAMI3), and what do the discrepancies reveal about the fundamental physics and chemistry of the ionosphere? To address the final research question, we will analyze outputs of SAMI3 ionospheric simulations by fitting the modeled profiles for the same parameters as in the radar data analysis. We will compare the SAMI3 parameters to the ranges of parameters found in our historical radar data analysis. Furthermore, we have identified a few events with excellent RISR observations for detailed comparisons to dedicated SAMI3 simulations of those events.If successful, this project will expand our understanding of polar cap density structures and inform improved modeling of the arctic radio propagation environment.

The polar cap ionosphere is a particularly complex radio propagation environment since the ionospheric plasma is frequently structured by mesoscale features such as tongues of ionization and polar cap patches. The significant electron density gradients in these structures can affect many different technologies important to arctic naval operations, including global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), high frequency (HF) communication signals, and over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) signals. Our historical data analysis will inform radio operations of the ranges of parameters expected and possible worst-case scenarios for radio propagation conditions. Furthermore, our data-model comparisons will inform future model development and provide quantitative assessments of the model performance.less","361,798",2023,2027
0,Ultrashort-Pulse Laser and Ultrafast-Gated ICCD for Generating and Measuring Strongly-Correlated Plasmas,United States Air Force,to Seth Putterman,"As energy is injected into matter it eventually reaches the plasma state where electrons are separated from ions. The importance of electrostatic interaction in a plasma is determined by the plasma parameter which is the ratio of electric potential energy to thermal potential energy. Space plasmas and Tokomaks are dilute and have <<1. Dense plasmas with >>1 appear in sonoluminescence, and sparks and laser breakdown in dense gases. In laser breakdown initiated with an ultrashort flash of light a neutral gas made of hydrogen at 10atm transforms into a dense plasma with a temperature of 35,000K (and an internal pressure >3000atm), which to our surprise did not explode but instead held together and dwelled at its initial radius for more than 200 picoseconds. We propose that dwelling is due to the formation of a highly correlated plasma 70 which causes the hot gas to behave like a fluid with a tensile strength. In order to probe the physicalproperties of these plasmas and in order to reach around 150 where the plasma is predictedto behave like a crystal, we need to reliably generate breakdown in gas at pressures of around 50atm and to penetrate these gases with far UV light on femtosecond time scales. Such capabilities are provided by the proposed 7mJ femtosecond laser system. In order to acquire fast images of dense plasma sparks and breakdown we also propose to acquire an intensied CCD with a 500ps shutter. Advances in the basic science of dense plasmas have consequences for o equilibrium transport and novel routes to nuclear fusion. This research instrumentation proposal is intended to be synergistic with the AFOSR project on strongly-correlated plasmas (Measurements and Applications of Strongly-Correlated Plasmas Generated in Dense Noble Gases,"" AFOSR FA9550-16-1-0271, Principal Investigator Seth Putterman).less","361,768",2017,2018

0,All-Optical Transformations Performed Using Diffractive Materials,United States Air Force,to AYDOGAN OZCAN,"University of California Los Angeles will conduct basic research on the analyses of complex-valued all-optical linear transformations, passively performed by diffractive materials between an input and output field-of-view, without the need for an external power source, except for the illumination light. These all-optical, passive processors will be composed of transmissive diffractive layers, where each feature (neuron) of a given layer has an engineered complex-valued transmission coefficient, connecting itself to the successive diffractive layers by modulating the phase and-or amplitude of a local spherical wave, following the Huygens-Fresnel principle of light diffraction. The individual features-neurons of a diffractive layer will each be at the scale of half a wavelength and will be designed to collectively control the modes of light propagation within a diffractive material volume. By using an analytical inverse design strategy as well as deep learning-based optimization and error-backpropagation methods, a diffractive material system that is composed of K diffractive layers with a total of N neurons will be spatially-engineered to approximate an arbitrary complex valued linear transformation (defined by A) between the input and output fields-of-view. After the numerical design phase, the resulting diffractive layers will be fabricated and physically assembled together to all-optically perform an approximate transformation (A?) between a complex-valued input field and the output field, through light-matter interaction within the spatially-engineered volume of the diffractive material. In our analyses, we will also compare the all-optical transformation errors and diffraction efficiencies that can be achieved using data-free inverse designs and data-driven designs of diffractive materials built to perform a desired transformation. These all-optical transformations will act on both the phase and amplitude information of the input, computing the output at the speed of light propagation within the diffractive material and will not use of any external computing power, except for the illumination source.less","360,295",2021,2024
0,Bioinspired Artificial Homeostatic Multi-functional Material Microsystems (AHM3) Based on Self-Sustaining Autonomi Adaptive Structures,United States Air Force,to Ximin He,"This proposal seeks to apply the concept of biological “homeostasis” to design, create, and investigate non-conventional Artificial Homeostatic Multifunctional Material Microsystems (AHM3)that are capable of real-time sensing-and-adapting to regulate local conditions including temperature, air pressure, and light at a constant level against environment perturbations. The objectives include: (i) Identifying the requisite design criteria and working principle of AHM3 based on the structure-property relationship using computational simulation and experimental integrative manufacturing. (ii) Establishing a multifunctional platform that self-regulates four exemplary properties - temperature, O2/CO2 pressure, pH, and light. (iii) Characterizing the integration and performance of multiple self-regulations to elucidate the rich dynamic physics and mechanics through a combination of experiments and computational modeling. The artificial homeostasis will be achieved by developing bioinspired adaptively reconfigurable structures with built-in chemo-mechanical feedback loops. The hierarchical microstructure consists of stimuli-responsive hydrogel actuating on demand to control various chemical reactions (producing/absorbing heat, O2/CO2, or light), to rectify local condition fluctuations. This project is expected to yield a new broad-based materials platform for autonomous regulation with significant modularity and design flexibility, permitting exploratory studies of adaptive reconfiguration. With joint experimental-computational efforts, the research will elucidate the principle of design and integration of the hierarchical hybrid material systems, understand the physics of the sensing-actuating sequence in the mechano-chemical signal transduction, and discover the rich dynamic behaviors in the regulating multiple signals in different self-oscillation modes.less","360,000",2017,2020

0,Toolkit to Change the Domain of Computational Imaging Systems,United States Department of the Army,to Achuta Kadambi,"Image processing algorithms map an input image into an output image. This output is also known as a target image. Ordinarily, it is assumed that the space of target images is well characterized and/or that examples of target images can be provided. For example, when mapping blurry images to sharp images, one knows what a sharp image should look like and also has a dataset of many examples of blurry and sharp image pairs. Finding the transformation boils down solving for a known-unknown. In contrast to previous work, this proposal considers the case when both the transformation and the target space is unknown. We refer to this problem as Blind Image Translation. If successful, blind image translation is precisely geared toward never-before-seen areas of image processing. After all, the target images have never been observed in previous work. The proposal considers one such example in detail; that of imaging bias. It is widely reported that imaging systems and algorithms are biased against certain demographics. For example, pedestrian detection is more difficult on darker skin tones. The core question we would like to address is whether we can build a camera system that capture ÒcolorlessÓ representations of the world. It is not clear what a colorless representation looks like, which necessitates the blind domain translation framework. If successful, colorless imagesÑ-when used downstream in a computer vision pipelineÑdo not exhibit any performance bias that disadvantages certain skin tone classifications. To fabricate the colorless camera, we develop a method to project the blind domain translation to the set of feasible optical parameters. This enables us to learn a map which can be optically instantiated (through the use of UCLA fabrication facilities). The colorless camera is then used to demonstrate resistance to bias on three visual applications: pedestrian detection, remote plethysmography (rPPG) and a visual Turing Test. Longer-term, the Òspace of fair imagesÓ is only one exemplary case of an unknown target space. The proposal lays a foundation for image processing of input images into unknown target spaces.less","360,000",2021,2024
0,THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF N00014-14-1-0683 Imaging science algorithms based on finite and infinite dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations,United States Department of the Navy,to Stanley Osher,"Statement of Work Many image or signal acquisition and processing problems are formulated as an estimation problem in an infinite dimensional framework or in a finite dimensional framework. Standard approaches to solve these problems consist in using variational methods and/or Bayesian approaches, either in a finite or infinite dimensional formalism. These imaging science estimation tasks are a growing field at the confluence of applied mathematics and computer science. They require sound theoretical grounds (i) to provide fine analysis, optimal performances, fast algorithms and (ii) to improve the image processing chain (i.e., from the acquisition of the data up to the image or signal analysis). The work we shall propose consists in three complementary tasks that we briefly describe now: Task 1: ""Hamilton-Jacobi equations and finite dimensional variational methods"". Recently, Darbon showed a connection between certain finite dimensional convex imaging problems and Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations. Task 1 proposes to extend this connection to cope with 1) 1- homogeneous data fidelity terms (like the l1+TV model), 2) image decomposition models (like Meyer's cartoon+texture model), 3) inverse scale space based image restoration models. These results will allow us to improves image restoration methods over standard non-adaptive methods. We also propose to investigate this H-J formulation to provide new efficient numerical algorithms. Task 2: ""Stochastic and Bayesian point of views"". Task 2 proposes to explore potential connections between viscous H-J equations and sctochastic and Bayesian models. First, we would like to better understand the connections between viscous H-J equations and Bayesian estimators. We intend to develop a mathematical theory that aims to better understand the behavior of Bayesian restoration methods for image processing tasks. Second, we will address questions related to the formulation of Bayesian estimators in terms of Feynman-Kac formulas and path integral formulations. Finally, we expect to be able to highlight deep connections between large deviation theory and H-J equations. Task 3: ""New algorithms for super resolution and computational photography based on infinite dimensional H-J equations"". Task 3 proposes to bring the H-J formalism to treat the data acquisition step in addition to the data processing. In order to complete this task we need to use an infinite dimensional version of H-J equations to cope with the continuous observed world. The obtained framework will allow us to improve the imaging chain (from the data acquisition up to the image or signal analysis). The point of view given by a new infinite dimensional H-J formula will be applied to 1) the super resolution of sparse signals and 2) to the computational photography paradigm. This work will allow us to have a deep understanding of the feasibility and difficulty of these two problems. In addition, it will allow us to develop fast new numerical algorithms. Timeline: Year 1: The task 1, entitled ""Hamilton-Jacobi and finite dimensional variational methods"", with some preliminary work on Task 2 and 3 could be developed the first year (July 2014-June 2015). Year 2: The task 2, entitled ""Stochastic and Bayesian point of views"", with some further work on task 3 could be developed the second year (July 2015-June 2016).

The focus of the proposed work is on the fundamental physics that governs the interactions in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, the target location for the Near Inertial Shear and Kinetic Energy in the North Atlantic Experiment(NISKINE). The approach will be to conduct a hierarchy of idealized and realistic state of the art numerical simulations in conjunction with the NISKINE in situ observations for validation The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude wind-forced NIWs. The objectives are 1) to quantify the role of the interactions in making coherent Near-Inertial Oscillations incoherent, thus allowing NIWs to propagate downward from the mixed layer and feed a broad-band internal wave (IW) spectrum or possibly a mixed sub-mesoscale-IW spectrum associated with a stimulated forward cascade, and 2) to determine how mesoscale eddies and SMCs are modified through interactions with NIWs and develop methods to parametrize these wave-induced modifications. 2.0 Requirements: The tasks to be performed are the following: 2.1 Setup realistic simulations in the NISKINE region using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), with appropriate high-frequency wind forcing and multi-level grid nesting of successively finer resolution (_x = 6; 1:5; 0:5; 0:15 km). 2.2 Validate the ROMS solutions against existing and future (NISKINE) observations. Test the sensitivity of the results to the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric wind product. 2.3 Setup idealized simulations using the Large Eddy Simulator Flow Solve, with different stratification, rotation, current strength, and NIW amplitudes, to characterize the NIW-eddy interactions in a wide range of oceanic flow regimes. 2.4 Preform additional realistic ROMS simulations while systematically excluding the forcing components responsible for the generation of NIWs. 2.5 Asses the strength of the NIW-eddy interactions and energy exchanges in the idealized and realistic simulations under the different forcing scenarios, grid resolutions, and parameter regimes. 2.6 Investigate ways to parametrize the effects NIWs have on mesoscale eddies and SMCs using existing and to be developed analytical theories in the idealized solutions. 2.7 Investigate Eulerian- and Lagrangian-based methods to decompose between mesoscale eddies, SMCs, and NIWs in the idealized solutions. 2.8 Apply and test the parametrization and decomposition tools in the realistic solutions. 2.9 Publish findings. 3.0 Deliverables: Reports will be submitted on an annual basis, and a final report will be submitted upon the completion of the award.less","358,053",2018,2021

Specifically,through the AFOSR BRI program, we have constructed a cold molecular beam usingcryogenic buffer-gas cooling coupled a radio frequency Paul trap with an integratedmass spectrometer. This system is being used to observe reactions between the coldmolecular beam and cold target ions held in the Paul trap.

0,Probing the Performance Limit of High Speed Graphene Transistors with an Environmentally Controlled RF Probe,United States Department of the Navy,to Xiangfeng Duan,"Funding is provided for the acquisition of an environmentally controlled RF probe station and measurement system for probing the fundamental performance limit of transistors made of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., MoS2). The establishment of the proposed measurement system offers the critical tool for accomplishing the research goals outlined in two previously funded ONR projects. With the highest carrier mobility, carrier saturation velocity and single atomic thickness, graphene is emerging as an attractive material for ultra-high speed radio frequency (RF) electronics. However, the fabrication of high speed graphene transistors is of significant challenge since the conventional material integration and electronic fabrication process can often introduce severe defects in the monolayer graphene lattices to degrade its electronic performance, or result in non-ideal device geometry with excessive parasitic capacitances or access resistances. We have recently developed a self-aligned approach to address these challenges and enable graphene transistors with sub-100 nm channel length and unprecedented speed (with the projected cut-off frequency exceeding 1 THz). On the other hand, it is non-trivial to probe the fundamental RF performance limit of these aggressively scaled graphene transistors because the intrinsic large surface area associated with nanoscale graphene devices make them highly susceptible to environmental changes. Additionally, to access the ultimate RF performance limit of the graphene transistors requires the application of high bias voltage and high current, which can often lead to premature breakdown of the devices without proper environmental control. The DURIP support will be used to acquire an environmentally controlled RF probe station and measurement system for probing the fundamental performance limit of transistors made of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., MoS2). The establishment of the proposed measurement system offers the critical tool for accomplishing the research goals outlined in two previously funded ONR projects. Additionally, we will collaborate with UCLA Center for High Frequency Electronics, to make this new capability accessible to all researchers on campus (e.g., the STARnet FAME program funded partly by DARPA) for the characterization of diverse electronic devices, particularly unconventional devices enabled by low-dimensional materials, under controlled environment.

0,THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF N00014-12-1-0834 Computational Solids and Fluids in Real and Interactive Time,United States Department of the Navy,to Joseph Teran,"Summary. Numerical methods for the simulation of solid and uid mechanics have a long history in applied elds like structural engineering and aircraft design. However, as modern computing architectures progress and as computational power increases, numerical methods will nd an increasingly wide range of revolutionary applications that would have previously been impractical or impossible. Other revolutionary applications of improved computational capability will result from the increasingly high level of available detail. This is particularly true in biomechanics related problems, where for example computational models that characterize the structure and function of human anatomy have emerged as powerful tools in biomechanical engineering and medicine in recent years. However, these tools are still heavily limited by current performance, and the di erence seems unlikely to be lled by newer generation hardware. While single core computers have traditionally been expected to deliver increased clock rates every few years, this trend ended recently due to strict heat and power constraints, with single-core performance not improving much since 2005, with subsequent improvements mostly through adding more cores on a chip. This increases the overall processing power available, but only if the parallelism can be exploited e ectively. Improvements in memory performance continue to lag signi cantly behind, further limiting the ability to harness the additional power. Exploiting the SIMD parallelization opportunities available on these cores produces a signi cant speedup at all problem sizes. Performance gains through many-core parallelism are signi cant for large problems but have been relatively modest for problems with moderate to low degree of freedom counts. Since the problem sizes that run near real time are too small to bene t from these advances, an alternate approach is required. STI's Cell architecture has proven e ective at computational work ows due to its very high memory bandwidth and raw processing power. This architecture has one general-purpose computing core and eight special-purpose heavily-vectorized processing units. Each special- ized unit has an explicitly-maintained local store instead of the more common implicitly- maintained cache hierarchy, which allows for better utilization of available on-chip storage with less overhead. Coupled with its high bandwidth and computing power, this makes it a promising candidate for advancing performance on near-real-time simulation sizes. The PI proposes to investigate this unique architecture to improve the real-time limit from a few tens of thousands of degrees of freedom to a hundred thousand degrees of freedom while utilizing inexpensive commodity hardware. At the same time, the PI proposes to utilize the same architecture to improve the performance of large simulations. Another approach that has lead to signi cant improvements at large problem sizes is multi- grid preconditioning, but these bene ts are minimal for problems small enough to run near real time. Since multigrid preconditioners are of little bene t for Krylov solvers on small sizes but profoundly important for large sizes, the PI will continue to investigate these solvers and preconditioners as well as e ective transition strategies between them. In addition to these new directions, the PI will continue to pursue improvements in the ability to handle the large deformation in the complex materials typical of biological systems. The PI will also continue to improve the state-of-the-art for simulation algorithms designed to handle complex and irregular geometry as well as multiple interacting materials.less","334,235",2015,

Current planar axisymmetric MEM resonators have achieved impressive ARW and minimum zero rate bias instability figures, however, turn-on to turn-on rate bias values and long-term drift are still barriers to adopting these technologies where long-term stability are system requirements. Greater environmental control, and sophisticated signal processing and calibration techniques can provide marginal performance gains, however, the greatest benefits will be derived from improvements in the resonator itself. Resonators with longer time constants will benefit from an overall reduction in the zero rate bias and quadrature signals and lead to more stable bias signals. In order to achieve longer time constants, the mindset in the community appears to be aimed at shrinking the hemispherical resonator gyro. As a consequence, small three-dimensional hemispherical or hemitoroidal resonators are being vigorously pursued by a number of research groups. These research efforts have spurred the development new fabrication techniques, and impressive time constants have been reported in some cases, however, a major challenge to overcome is the transduction of the resonator signals and integration of the resonator into a package, both of which are complicated by the curvilinear resonator structure. Planar axisymmetric resonator designs which are similar to proven high-performance silicon gyros like the DRG, have not been addressed by these programs yet can achieve long time constants and have the advantage of being much easier to fabricate, transduce and integrate into a package due to their two-dimensional structure. The requested equipment will be used to create and optimize the dynamics of small, high quality factor, planar resonators using traditional low-cost fabrication techniques. The equipment will extend the fabrication, test and measurement capability of the PI’s DoDsupported vibratory gyro research program.

0,Shock Response of Sodalime Glass at Extraordinary Pressures and Strain Rates,United States Department of the Navy,to Vijay Gupta,"There is a significant interest in understanding the behavior of soda-lime glass (SLG) under extreme conditions of strain rate, temperature, and pressure (>20 GPa) as it undergoes a phase transformation with up to 40% or more volume change. During this process, several high density polymorphs, including the ultra-hard Stishovite phase which has a density of 4.313 g/cc, are formed. A significant amount of energy is consumed during this process. Since such extreme conditions are generated during impact of hypervelocity projectiles, there is a significant interest in the armor design community to incorporate soda-lime glass in advanced armor concepts for protection against shapedcharges that send explosively formed projectiles with speeds up to 10,000 m/s.The aim of this proposal is to explore the shock compression response of SLG in the ultrahigh pressure (> 40 GPa) and strain rate (> 108s1) regime, and to develop a new experimental setup to measure the local temperature rise in the shocked SLG samples. The high pressure shock data will be obtained in two ways.In the first effort, the shock pressure will enhanced by reducing the cross-sectional geometry of the samples. Specifically, SLG micropillars of varying diameters (100 2000 nm) and aspect ratios will be fabricated using lithography and each pillar impacted individually by aligning its axis with the center of micro flyer plate. Because of the relatively high inertia of the flyer platecompared to each micropillar, local stresses approaching 60 GPa at strain rates > 109s1 can be attained even with UCLAs current setup that can generate a maximum nominal shock pressure of 21GPa.In the second effort, the top hat beam element that converts the laser pulse with the Gaussian energy distribution into one with a flat energy profile will be redesigned and updated to attain flyer velocities nearing 4 km/s. Based on Professor Asimovs data that was recently shared with the ONR PIs, shock pressures around 55 GPa can be generated in flat SLG samples, withouteven considering the pillar effect. If this is successful, impacting a single pillar at this velocity will result in hitherto unreported pressure levels.Besides obtaining the EOS data, the deformed samples will be examined for stishovite formation using the HRTEM/SEM/FFT techniques as in our previous effort. It is noteworthy that in both of the above efforts, SLG samples will be subjected to strain rates of 108s1 and higher. By comparing the EOS data from this study with those from other investigations, the effect of ultrahighstrain rate on SLG deformation will be determined.Finally, in addition to examining the effects of high pressure and ultrahigh strain rate, the effect of temperature in the formation of high density polymorphs will be studied by measuring the local temperature rise in shocked samples by using the Time-domain Thermo Reflectance (TDTR) method. In this method, an Al film with a known dependence of its reflectance on temperature is deposited on the surface of the sample. The change in the reflectance suffered by the Al film due toshock-induced transient temperature rise is recorded by bouncing off a train of pulses from a highspeed femtosecond laser. The measured reflectance data is converted into the temperature using the known (calibrated) dependence of reflectance on temperature for the Al film. There is very limited experimental data available on shock-induced temperature rise in SLG.The basic science mechanisms resulting from this study should ultimately lead to the development of glass polycrystals and glass-based composites for integration into advance armors.less","250,000",2020,2022

This unique capability has become possible by a new class of multi-spectral plasmonic nanostructures integrated with semiconductors, which enable efficient interaction of optical and terahertz beams with semiconductors at nanoscale in a time-resolved optical-pump terahertz-probe measurement system. By using this powerful technique, the Terahertz Electronics Laboratory has been conducting research on ballistic and quasi ballistic carrier transport dynamics at nanoscale and has gained valuable knowledge on the fundamental physical limitations of nano-electronic and nano-photonic devices. However, a major limitation in this study has been the relatively long spectral scanning times, which prevents monitoring the phonon scattering dynamics and thermal effects while studying the ballistic and quasi-ballistic carrier transport dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures. The relatively long spectral scanning times are due to the requirement for varying the time-delay between the optical pump and probe pulses in a time-domain spectroscopy system. Through this DURIP proposal, we request funds for purchasing a synchronized phase-modulated dual femtosecond laser package, which eliminates the need for a variable time-delay between the pump and probe optical pulses in a time-domain spectroscopy setup. It allows capturing the spectroscopic data in one snap-shot, which enables monitoring the phonon scattering dynamics and thermal effects while studying the ballistic and quasi-ballistic carrier transport dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures. This new capability would fill an important knowledge gap, both from a fundamental physics perspective and for utilizing unique functionalities of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. It enables fundamental discoveries on the interaction of phonons, electrons, holes, excitons and semiconductor lattice. In particular, understanding the dynamics of ballistic and quasi-ballistic carrier energy dissipation while interacting with semiconductor interfaces, defects and scattering centers helps optimizing power consumption and efficiency of nano-scale photovoltaics, nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices integrated on a single chip. It also offers a valuable understanding of the fundamental physical limitations of ultrafast operation of nanoscale devices and a more realistic prediction for the ultimate extent of transistor scaling roadmap in the future.less","243,179",2015,

0,"Characterization, modeling, and control of turbulence from a network-theoretic perspective",United States Department of the Army,to Kunihiko Taira,"Turbulent flows are ubiquitous in engineering and science, and there is great interest in modifying the behaviors of such flows to enhance mixing, reduce drag, and improve fuel efficiency for various fluid based engineering systems. Analyzing and controlling turbulent flows is difficult due to the rich high-dimensional complex vortex dynamics with strong nonlinear interactions that take place over a broad range of length and time scales. To improve our ability to modify turbulent fluid flows, the current computational and theoretical study proposes to perform interaction-based characterization and control of canonical turbulent flows by taking advantage of network theory. A fluid flow network can be described as a complete graph with edge weights having a wide range of scales. In fact, our preliminary findings show that the complex vortical interactions in isotropic turbulence can be described by a weighted scale-free network. To capture the essence of the flow interactions while achieving global conservation properties, we will model the complex fluid flow by reducing the dimension of the state variables using concepts from Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) and further extracting the dominant interactions present in the physics using our Sparsified Dynamics Model (SDM). By combining these two approaches, we will be able to achieve a sparse lower-order representation of the turbulent flow fields using network-based techniques. Once the sparse network-based model of turbulent fluid flow is established, we will perform open and closed-loop control of the dominant structures in turbulent flows of interest. Instead of full structural control of every node, or eddy, in the flow, we are interested in the degree of controllability of large-scale coherent structures. We will therefore investigate the controllability of scale-free turbulence networks using techniques from balanced model reduction and the aforementioned network-based techniques. In particular, we will extend dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to network contexts. Recent innovations of DMD/Koopman analysis with control will provide insights into spatial-temporal coherent structures in the fluid network and will enable advanced nonlinear control. We will consider a number of candidate turbulent flow problems to apply the aforementioned network-based analysis and control techniques. These problems will be selected to highlight the dynamic behavior of fluid flows on networks and test the effectiveness of the developed controllers. In particular, we will examine high-dimensional networked ODE models such as the Kuramoto oscillator network (which captures fundamental behavior of unsteady flows), two and three-dimensional isotropic turbulence, and wall-bounded turbulent flows. These problems play fundamental roles in fluid mechanics, which can lead to broader impacts in how turbulent flows in general can be modeled and controlled. The findings and developments from the proposed e ort should bring rise to a new approach in controlling the global behavior of turbulent flows by modifying the interaction network of turbulent vortices, complementing traditional active turbulence control e orts. We foresee that the proposed effort will not only lay a pathway for the control of continuum systems, but also for other high-dimensional dense networks with complex dynamics.less","238,203",2019,2020

0,Self-Propelled Ink Deposition Robot (SPIDR) that 3D Prints Structures in Space,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Jonathan Hopkins,"We propose spider-inspired 3D-printing robots, called Self-Propelled Ink Deposition Robots (i.e., SPIDRs), that fabricate complex large structures in space by crawling on the web-like constituent struts that they simultaneously print. The inherent flexibility underlying the fabrication approach of these SPIDRs will enable structures of almost any geometry to be made in space for satisfying the requirement of numerous applications and for addressing a variety of unanticipated scenarios on demand (e.g., repairing structures damaged by space debris). Additionally, since the structures that the SPIDRs fabricate consist of ink that is pumped to their deposition nozzles through tethers connected to storage containers, only the ink needs to be periodically launched into space to replenish the containers once the SPIDRs have already been deployed there. Thus, all required building materials can be brought into space in their most compact, volume-efficient, and shape-flexible form for dramatically reducing the cost of space structures. The automated and swarm-inspired teamwork that SPIDRs leverage would also increase the fabrication speed of such structures, which would reduce their cost further. Although there are numerous challenges that need to be addressed to enable the proposed robots, the most important and thus the one that this effort will most directly address is the challenge of enabling vibration compensation. It is difficult to 3D print structures with sufficient feature resolution when the nozzle depositing the ink is continually vibrating different and unanticipated amounts in all six degrees of freedom (i.e., three independent translations and three independent rotations) with respect to the structure being printed. Such vibrations are inevitable since the SPIDRs crawl on the structures while their geometry changes as they are printed and as temperatures fluctuate cyclically as the structures orbit. Other sources of vibrations include tidal gravitational forces or gravitational forces from other orbiting bodies. Moreover, natural frequency vibrations will be passively induced within the large printed structures since they are largely undamped in the vacuum of space. The legs of the SPIDR, which anchor the print nozzle to the structures being printed are also relatively compliant by necessity and consist of multiple actuators arranged in serial configurations that will give rise to other vibrations. Thus, we aim to design a print head with large-deformation flexures that can be actuated with sufficient speed and precision to correct for the print head’s vibrations such that its nozzle can remain stable with respect to the structure that it is printing. Moreover, new approaches will be explored for enabling the sensing of the relative nozzle locations with respect to its printed structure such that closed-loop control can be employed.less","220,000",2020,2021
0,DURIP FABRICATION OF BRAIN-INSPIRED NETWORKS FOR MULTIFUNCTIONAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,United States Air Force,to YONG CHEN,"This Defense University Instrumentation Program (DURIP) proposal aims to establish key instruments to test the brain-inspired networks for multifunctional intelligent systems in an AFOSR Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) project, entitled 'Brain-Inspired Networks for Multifunctional Intelligent Systems in Aerial Vehicles' (PI- Yong Chen, UCLA, Award Number- FA9550-19-1-0213). The world’s fastest supercomputer, Summit, may have a computing capacity comparable to that of the human brain and simulate the intelligent functions of the human brain, but Summit consumes the equivalent power of 7000 homes (~15 MW), and the brain only consumes a power of a light bulb (~20 W). This fundamentally restrains computers from handling 'big data' efficiently in complex dynamic environments, and limits the developments of mobile intelligent systems such as self-piloted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By contrast, the brain simultaneously processes and learns from 'big data' via trillions of synapses and neurons in analog parallel mode, and facilitates parallel processing and real-time learning with an energy efficiency more than five orders of magnitude superior to that of the supercomputer.less","219,991",2022,2023
0,Interaction of active flow control and global instability,United States Department of the Navy,to Kunihiko Taira,"When an aerodynamic body undergoes flight maneuvers in o~-design conditions, flow separation can adversely impact its aerodynamic performance. Active flow control can play an important role in modifying the behavior of the surrounding flows to achieve improvement in terms of lift enhancement, drag reduction, fuel efficiency, and enhanced maneuverability of the flying vehicle. The challenges in modifying or controlling the behavior of fluid flow stem from the rich dynamics that fluid flows possess over a wide range of temporal andspatial scales, especially for high Reynolds number flows. While there has been tremendous development in the field of nonlinear dynamics and control theory, the available theories are still limited to small and moderate sized problems. The high-dimensional (if not infinite dimensional) fluid flow systems pose a challenge in controlling the flows in a predictable and robust manner. Hence, the proposed project aims to extract the features of the flow that contribute to the dominant stability characteristics and understand how they interact withforcing inputs in altering the mean flow profile.The objective of the proposed effort is to uncover the interaction mechanismbetween active flow control input and the global instability modes in externalflow over a canonical airfoil geometry. To achieve the goals of this study, wewill examine the flow field with global stability analysis and resolvent analysis,whose results will be examined in detail using a novel network theoretic approach to highlight the interactions and the causal relationship in the flow field. The use of network analysis in this proposed project will reveal the missing links between the stability modes and how they interact with external forcing to modify the mean flow field that predominantly determines the performance of aerodynamic bodies. The formulation proposed here is general in nature and can consider the interaction between hydrodynamic instability modes and flow control forcing inputs or perturbations in the flow, in the form of atmospheric fluctuations or vortical disturbances. Such formulation at the moment is largelymissing when analyzing large-scale fluid flow data sets and can provide a broader impact on the fluid mechanics community at large.The analytical toolsets developed from this study and the resulting physical insights into the fluid flow will enhance our present capability of aerodynamic design and active flow control technologies. If successful, the output from the current investigation will enable engineers and scientists to understand how active flow control inputs and external perturbations can alter the mean flow which directly influences the performance of aerodynamic bodies, such as wings. As we aim for our next-generation aircraft (and submarines) to achieve higher levels of maneuverability and agility in unsteady environments with large-scale disturbances, the use of flow control and the underlying flow physics become ever more important. The proposed investigation may offer critical insights into how fluid flows are altered by external forcing and disturbance, providing pathways to tame unsteady fluid flow over not only the vehicles employed by the US Navy but also those in service by the Department of Defense.less","210,430",2019,2021

0,Development of 3 D Freestream Receptivity DNS Data Base for Hypersonic Flow over Spherical and Elliptical Cones,United States Air Force,to Xiaolin Zhong,"The receptivity of hypersonic boundary layers to freestream forcing waves plays a critical role in the transition of the hypersonic boundary layer downstream. Specifically, quantitative receptivity coefficients are needed in the following two areas of transition predictions and studies: 1) the development of physics based e^n transition prediction based on Mack's amplitude method, and 2) the DNS studies of nonlinear receptivity and breakdown of boundary layer to turbulence that is induced by freestream noise. These extensive receptivity coefficients can only be obtained by complex 3 D receptivity simulation, which is a challenging task and has not been done so far. Therefore, this proposal seeks to conduct DNS study on the 3 D receptivity of hypersonic boundary layer to freestream disturbance waves to develop a linear receptivity database in the frequency domain for both spherical and elliptical cones. The DNS results will subsequently be used to obtain receptivity coefficients for the e^n amplitude method and for the inlet conditions of the DNS of nonlinear receptivity and breakdown induced by freestream disrurbances. The specific research objectives are: 1) Develop new high order DNS methods and computer codes for simulation study of fundamental receptivity and instability mechanisms of hypersonic flow; 2) Conduct extensive DNS studies of 3 D receptivity of hypersonic boundary layers to freestream disturbances of various types, flow configurations including both spherical and elliptical cones at zero and non zero angles of attack; 3) Use our analytical tools to extract the continuous frequency spectra of the receptivity coefficients; 4) Set up the framework of using the receptivity database to assign inlet conditions for 3 D DNS of the nonlinear receptivity to freestream noise and the nonlinear breakdown simulation.less","200,000",2019,2022
0,De-bloating Managed Runtmes for Scalable Data-Intensive Systems,United States Department of the Navy,to Harry Xu,"One of the key challenges in Big Data is how to develop systems that can scale to massive amounts of data with relatively small amounts of resources. The mainstream approach is to enable distributed data processing, resulting in development of distributed platforms utilizing large numbers of machines. Manyof these platforms are written in managed languages such as Java, C#, or Scala. While these languages simplify development effort, their runtime system has a high cost, which cannot be amortized by increasing the number of machines. Poor performance on each node reduces the scalability of the whole cluster: a large number of machines are needed to process a small dataset, leading to excessive use of resources and increased communication overhead. This project explores an alternative direction, that is, how to effectively optimize the managed runtime to improve performance and scalability of data processing on each machine.We propose a five-step research agenda that exploits language, compiler, and systems support to improve performance and scalability of managed Big Data programs. Our first observation is that the number of data objects in the heap must not grow proportionally with the data cardinality. Based on this observation, the first step of the project will investigate a new execution model that can statically bound the number of data objects in the heap. In particular, we propose to allocate (arbitrarily many) data items in the off-heap, native memory, and only create a statically bounded pool of heap objects that keep getting reused to represent data items. An iteration-based mechanism is used to reclaim data items while GC scans only the regular heap, leading to reduced header/pointer overhead and memory management costs. The second and third step of the project will investigate compiler and runtime system support that can automatically enforce the object- bounded property by statically transforming and dynamically optimizing existing programs, respectively.Another major performance issue is the overly-parallel execution of data processing tasks in which developers create a large number of threads to fully utilize the underlying parallelism. However, the excessive creation of objects and use of collections incurs tremendous runtime bloat that is duplicated in each thread created, making the system quickly hit the memory wall. The fourth step of the project will develop a novel language, ScaleJ, that uses a dataflow semantics to support memory- and thread-oblivious development of data processing functions. ScaleJ allows developers to focus on high-level data processing logic without worrying about low-level memory and parallelism issues. The fifth step will develop an autotuning framework for ScaleJ that can safely and adaptively adjust the degree of parallelism by considering a varietyof parameters, including data partitioning, runtime bloat, memory availability, GC effort, and parallelism.Despite the large body of work on performance optimization for Big Data applications, none of the existing techniques have paid attention to performance issues that arise from the high cost of the managed runtime. As managed languages are gaining increasing popularity in development of Big Data systems, there is a pressing need to carefully study their performance problems, and design novel techniques to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this project is first attempt that improves Big Data scalability by optimizing managed runtime environments.ImpactsManaged languages are widely used to implement Big Data systems. Inefficiencies in these languages have caused significant scalability problems. This project will address this important problem and provide benefit to a wide community that researches and uses Big Data systems.The Navy is awash in data generated by sensors aboard ships, aircraft and other platforms.

0,Lens-based scanning nanoscopic imaging platform,United States Department of the Army,to Aydogan Ozcan,"This DURIP was used to purchase a lens-based scanning optical nanoscopy system to supplement and significantly improve the speed of progress in our existing Army Research Office (ARO) project (W911NF- 13-1-0419 Ð PI: Dr. Ozcan), which is titled ÒUltra-wide field imaging of single nano-particles, viruses and bacteria using field-portable computational on-chip microscopy and self-assembled liquid nano-lensesÓ. In this currently existing ARO project, we utilize stable and biocompatible thin wetting films to self assemble aspheric liquid nano-lenses around individual nano-particles or other nano-objects of interests, including viruses, to be able to detect ultra-weak signatures of these sub-wavelength objects using a portable on-chip microscope. This approach, when combined with digital holography and lensfree imaging, enables us to image and detect sub-50 nm particles (i.e., smaller than À/10 Ð one tenth of the wavelength of the illumination light) using field-portable and cost-effective imaging designs, across a very large field-of-view (FOV) of >20-30 mm2, i.e., about three orders-of-magnitude larger than other nano-imaging techniques. While this wide-field computational imaging capability of our technique is very exciting, especially in a cost-effective and portable design (making it suitable for use in field settings), it also creates a significant bottleneck for comparison and validation of our results because existing lens-based nanoscopy tools, without automated scanning features, have extremely limited FOVs Ð typically less than 0.05 mm2 per image.

0,Laser system for efficient cold molecular ion production for the study of quantum coherence and dipolar interactions in a molecular ion trap,United States Department of the Army,to Eric Hudson,"In the last five years the study of ultracold molecular ions has emerged as a new discipline within atomic physics. It is now clear that a trapped sample of ultracold molecular ions affords many of the benefits of ultracold neutral molecules, while significantly reducing experimental complexity Ð e.g. large trap depths, long trap lifetimes, and efficient detection. Despite the infancy of the field, there is already a clear path to a wide range of important studies, including the investigation of quantum chemistry, which not only has important implications for understanding the formation of interstellar clouds, but will allow for investigation, and possible control, of reactive collisions; precision measurement of molecular transitions, which can be used to very sensitively measure parity violating effects, as well as to constrain the possible variation of the fundamental constants; and the implementation of a scalable quantum computation architecture. Through our ongoing ARO Grant (Efficient cold molecular ion production for the study of quantum coherence and dipolar interactions in a molecular ion trap; W911NF-15-1-0121), we performed a series of experiments aimed at understanding the collisional physics between ultracold neutral atoms and molecular ions. This work resulted in several important observations of cold atomion photochemistry. These studies were among the first of their kind and have helped to open the field of cold atom-ion chemistry, which is shedding new light on chemical processes that play important roles in everything from the composition of the upper atmosphere and the interstellar medium to the operation of explosives. In addition to these reactivity studies, we also developed tools for analyzing trapped molecular ions and recording their spectra, as well as solved several longstanding problems regarding trapped ion Òthermodynamics. Finally, using the results of all of this work, we demonstrated that both the vibrational and translational degrees of freedom of trapped molecular ions are efficiently cooled by sympathetically cooling collisions with laser-cooled atoms. Thus, through our ARO support, we have developed many of the necessary tools and techniques to help open the field of ultracold molecular ion research. However, there is still an unsolved roadblock: we are unable to obtain information on the molecular ion rotational state and thus quantum manipulation of this useful degree of freedom is not possible. While it is very likely our cooling scheme is already producing ground state molecular ions, as detailed in this proposal, it is not possible with the experimental means available to us to verify the molecular ion rotational state. Through this proposed DURIP award, we will purchase a mid-IR laser system that will allow us to probe the molecular ion rotational state distribution. Thus, this award would allow us to study molecular ion rotational sympathetic cooling and probe the coherence of molecular ion rotational states in an ion trap via e.g. rotational state Rabi flopping.

0,Non-Invasive Military Metabolite Analyzer (NIMMA),United States Department of the Army,to Gil Travish,"Standard in vitro lab tests can help elucidate a patient’s health and diagnose several possible medical conditions to be monitored. Cost, patient and lab time, and patient discomfort, mean that these tests are done infrequently, and are limited to suspected morbidities. The invasive nature of most tests (requiring blood draws, urine samples, etc.) limits what is measured, and how often. In the field, such tests can be difficult to execute, require trained medics and samples can become contaminated or damaged in transport. The analytical equipment itself can also require calibration, decontamination, resupply of reagents, etc. all of which can be a bridge too far in austere environments. By avoiding the need for samples, in vivo tests avoid many of the challenges faced by traditional lab tests. No device exists that enables low cost, non-invasive in vivo testing. No service exists that translates repeated metabolomic measurements into dynamic health status reports. We are working to change that. We propose to develop a system for the detection of metabolites capable of automated field use by non-experts. Unlike existing efforts at Point Of Care (POC) devices, our approach is based on in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). While our approach has reduced sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art mass spec (MS) on in vitro samples, we assert that the benefits of avoiding sample extraction, handling and preparation, especially in austere environments, offsets the reduced sensitivity of MRS and the reduced sample volume of in vivo measurements. Indeed, the ability, which we are proposing, to simultaneously detect spectra from a variety of tissue types (e.g. blood, bone, fat, muscle, etc.) means that additional diagnostic information is available that would otherwise require biopsy and multiple complex tests. This multi-tissue and multi-metabolite scan capability is the functional equivalent of multiplexed in vitro tests. Our Non-Invasive Military Metabolite Analyzer (NIMMA) will offer many of the benefits of traditional laboratory tests without the pain of a blood draw and the waiting times associated with wet laboratory tests. Our test results can be obtained several times per day per patient to offer a dynamic timeline (longitudinal) and predict healthcare status changes on an individual and fighting force population basis. This allows for more rapid and continuous testing to quicken diagnoses. NIMMA tests provide data for the individual patient, and healthcare provider, to maintain and control a health status. Additionally, trauma specialists, GPs, clinicians, and other health workers can analyze diagnostic indicators of disease. Most importantly, our proposed scanner can be operated in the field by non-experts, quickly, pain-free and without the need for chemical reagents.less","172,705",2022,2023
0,a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify associated genetic markers with odor performance in dogs,United States Department of the Navy,to Robert Wayne,"Olfaction is the oldest of the vertebrate special senses and yet remains the least understood. In nearly all mammals, it plays vital roles in detecting threats and finding food, water, and potential mates. Domestic dogs represent an ideal species to better understand the mechanisms that determine olfactory functions and abilities. They are known for heightened skills of scent detection and some are trained to detect specific odors (Helton 2009). Olfactory sensitivity in canines is determined by genetic, neurological, physiological and developmental factors. In recent years, several studies attempted to better understand the olfactory functions by studying more specifically canine anatomy (Craven et al. 2007, 2010; Lawson et al. 2012; Bird et al. 2018; Rygg et al. 2017; Jenkins et al. 2018), gene expression and genetic variation of olfactory receptors (Vanderhaeghen et al. 1992; Issel-Tarver L et al. 1996, Zhang et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Quignon et al. 2012; Charruau et al. 2016; Li et al in prep; Mouton et al. in prep) however olfactory sensitivity has not well quantified using a behavioral assay (but see Konno et al. 2018 for a recent attempt to do so). In addition, the extent to which genetic architecture vary across behaviors and animal taxa is largely unexplored (York 2018).In this proposal, we propose to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between genetic markers and behavior in a large sample size of dogs, sufficient to detect associations between variants of small to moderate effect on olfactory performance.

Currently, the evaluation of fuel cell catalyst performance is based on either half-cell, typically rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup, or full cell, which is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). However, most of developed catalysts are only tested in RDE system, which shows some limitations for evaluating the catalystperformance in real PEMFC working environment and has already been pointed out in recent studies. RDE system cannot evaluate the polymer electrolyte membrane degradation and poison scenario which is critique for practical performance of PEMFC. Thus a set of full cell test system, including ultrasonic spray fuel cell coating system and PEMFC test station is needed for evaluatingcatalyst performance in practical working environment and further screen for best catalyst.

HF band covering frequency range between 3 to 30 MHz provides communications with ranges over thousands of kilometers through skywave propagation and offers an alternative to satellite communications.

0,"A Controlled-Environment, Field-Deployable (CEFD) Wind Tunnel to Enable Fundamental Research in Aeolian Transport",United States Department of the Army,to Gregory Okin,"Aeolian transport and dust emission have significant impact on climate and global biogeochemistry, but also pose serious hazards for human safety and equipment operation/maintenance. This proposal requests funds to construct a new field wind tunnel that will enable unique measurements related to aeolian transport and dust emission. Though climate-controlled wind tunnels exit, as do field wind tunnels, climate-controlled field wind tunnels do not yet exist. Indeed, even the current controlled-environment wind tunnels do not have the ability to control light levels, a key determinant of evaporation and aggregate formation in natural soils. The planned controlled-environment, field-deployable (CEFD) wind tunnel will fill this gap and will be used to address questions that are of interest to the DoD related to aeolian transport and dust emission. The proposed CEFD tunnel will be based on the modular design of the UCLA Portable Aeolian Laboratory (PAL). A recirculating design is required for control of temperature and humidity within the tunnel. Therefore, as a stand-alone tunnel, the CEFD tunnel will differ from the UCLA PAL in that it will recirculate air and will have environmental controls so that temperature, humidity, and light levels can be manipulated within the test section. We plan on a series of rigorous tests for the CEFD tunnel to determine the limits and stability of wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity control that can be obtained and to ensure these limits are within our design parameters. Upon successful completion of the tests, we will conduct experiments pertaining to an area of research currently funded by the DoD: How and when does precipitation impact dust emission? One of the tasks for the funded work is to test the hypothesis that soil moisture from precipitation rarely inhibits aeolian transport because, if wind events occur after the active layer (i.e., the top 2 mm of soil) has dried, then precipitation will have little effect on the threshold for transport. Understanding the interplay of wind and precipitation events in controlling aeolian transport and dust emission is, in part, limited by knowledge of the time it takes for the active layer to dry. Because evaporation is controlled by radiation and wind shear velocity, in addition to temperature Therefore, the first applications of the CEFD tunnel will be to conduct a series of dry-down experiments on natural soils of varying textures. We will vary temperature, relative humidity, light levels, and below-threshold wind speed to better parameterize dry-down under a range of realistic field conditions. This improved dataset will enable much better understanding of the conditions in which precipitation impacts aeolian transport and dust emission globally. The second application of the CEFD tunnel will be to study the complex dynamics in the interplay of drying, aeolian transport, and re-exposure of wet sand. As an extension of the planned dry-down experiments, using different temperatures, light levels, and above-threshold wind conditions, we will quantify the temporal evolution of aeolian transport as the surface soil dries and continues to expose wet soils when dry layers are transported. he third application of the CEFD tunnel will be to probe how saltation impacts the rate of soil drying as a result of the rapid drying of particles ejected from the surface through sand blasting. To study this phenomenon, we will conduct drying experiments with introduced saltators to compare the temporal evolution of transport with and without introduced saltators at a variety of temperature, humidity, and light conditions. Together this set of experiments, which can only be conducted by a CEFD tunnel, will answer critical questions about the interplay of wind and water in the production of dust from natural soils.less","162,940",2019,2020

This unique functionality is offered by multi-spectral plasmonic nanostructures fabricated on a photo-absorbing semiconductor substrate and designed to maximize the intensity and spatialoverlap of an optical pump beam with the incident electromagnetic wave to be probed. The optical pump beam and the incident electromagnetic wave will be focused onto nanoscale photoabsorbing semiconductor regions defined by the plasmonic nanostructures. As a result, opticallygenerated electron-hole pairs will be drifted to the metallic plasmonic nanostructures in response to the incident electromagnetic wave. The resulting photocurrent drifted to the metallicplasmonic nanostructures, which contains the intensity and spectral information of the incident electromagnetic wave, will be collected by an external circuit for processing. Moreover, by use of polarization-sensitive multi-spectral plasmonic nanostructure designs, the polarization state of the incident electromagnetic wave can be determined as a function of frequency.Through this DURIP proposal, the PI requests funds for purchasing a dual distributed feedback lasers system (Toptica TeraBeam 780) and its wavelength locking electronics to conduct fundamental studies on the behavior of plasmonic nanostructures in response to external electromagnetic waves in a multi-spectral electromagnetic wave platform and discover the fundamental physical limitations of sensitivity, bandwidth, and wavelength accuracy of the proposed spectrometer based on multi-spectral plasmonic nanostructures. The uniquespecifications of the requested laser system and its wavelength locking kit enables high precision (quantum limited) analysis of the spectral properties of electromagnetic waves from RF-THz with more than a 6 THz bandwidth with a spectral accuracy of less than 5 MHz. This new capability would fill an important knowledge gap, both from a fundamental physics perspective and for utilizing unique functionalities of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. It enablesfundamental discoveries on the interaction of phonons, electrons, holes, excitons and semiconductor lattice.

Traditionally, inorganic semiconductor based solar arrays have been used for space applications because of their highest efficiencies. However, these solar arrays have several major limitations like extremely high cost, low specific power and large stowage volume. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules offer a better alternative for space applications that need high specific power. OPV are low-cost, ultra lightweight, flexible, and can be made by a roll-to-roll process on flexible substrates. Also, due to their superior flexibility and rollability, OPV require a minimum of stowage space and can be inflated or unrolled for deployment. In this project, Solarmer Energy, in partnership with University of California, Los Angeles, and Analytical Mechanics Associates, proposes to develop lightweight, ultra-high power density OPV modules for space applications. At the end of the Phase I, the team will deliver flexible large area OPV modules (100 sq cm) with specific power density greater than 300 Watts/kg, module efficiency of 5%, and bend radius less than 1.5 inches. A deployment design will also be delivered for application of OPV modules in space. BENEFIT: This project will have significant educational, societal and scientific benefits. Solarmer""s collaboration with UCLA provides financial support for graduate students, and supports the development of clean energy technologies. Solarmer is a member of FlexTech Alliance, a center supported by the U.S. Army Research Lab, which is devoted to fostering the growth, profitability and success of the flexible, printed electronics supply chain. The U.S. currently lags behind Europe and Asia in deployment of printed electronics technology. The proposed project will accelerate the developments in OPV and will enable the manufacturing of the low cost solar cells leading to a homegrown clean energy manufacturing. One of the major societal benefits is the much needed jobs creation, especially in clean energy manufacturing. An OPV manufacturing plant will create about 100-200 new jobs, in addition to the hundreds of new jobs in related R & D, production development and system integration. Another important benefit of using OPV is the impact on the environment. Each 100 MW of installed OPV panels will save 80,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Each 100 MW of OPV will also replace 300 tons of batteries that are discarded from portable electronics. In the long term, OPV aim to achieve grid parity with conventional power by 2017 and will truly revolutionize U.S. power infrastructure. Solarmer""s OPV modules are ideal for defense applications such as spacecrafts and UAVs for military operations, surveillance and reconnaissance. OPV can greatly improve the range and flight duration of UAVs by supplying additional power. Other military applications include portable solar chargers for soldiers for powering weapons, radios and GPS equipment in remote locations. OPV can reduce the weight of the batteries that a soldier needs to carry by up to fifty percent and allow troops to spend more time away from their bases.less","150,000",2013,2014

0,Ultra Wideband Receiver (UWR) â€“ Sample Clock Modulation,United States Department of the Air Force,to Matthew Williams,"Modern electronic warfare (EW) employs agile, dynamic, convert waveforms. It has become challenging for legacy electronic intelligence (ELINT) receivers to intercept such waveforms. To cover a wide frequency band, many frequencies must be scanned rapidly. Therefore, the probability of intercepting by the super heterodyne receiver is limited by the intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth and tuning speed. The Ultra Wideband Receiver (UWR) enables the reception of a wide spectrum without the need of frequency scanning. Persistently monitoring wide spectrums allows rapid detection of multiple signals across different bands. The most brute-force approach to achieve such receiver is to use a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a broadband antenna and frontend. Even with the state-of-the-art ADC, it is not possible to cover the entire band of interest while satisfying Nyquist rate. Oceanit shall develop an UWR based on sample clock modulation, consisting of two subsystems: a non-uniform sampling module, using clock modulation to extract non-uniform samples from a time domain signal; and a frequency identification system based on compressive sensing (CS) and random sample consensus (RANSAC)module, identifying carrier frequency. By first creating (via RANSAC) and exploiting (via CS) sparsity in the frequency domain, we make accurate predictions despite relative lack of data.less","150,000",2019,2020

SPACE PLATFORMS & OPERATIONS TECH Abstract Research Objective The importance of phase change heat transfer devices and the motivation behind extending the compatibility of water as a working fluid in aluminum is addressed. Though water is widely used with copper, aluminum/water devices are not achievable in spite of the reduced weight and cost of the material. The obstacle in combining aqueous working fluids and aluminum in a phase change device is the creation of non-condensable gas (NCG) which leads to rapid failure. It is proposed to develop an inorganic aqueous solution for use in aluminum heat pipes. The objective of the proposed study is to provide the fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and thermodynamics needed to obtain a reliable aluminum/water device. Technical Approach Chemical reactions responsible for passivating the device material and preventing generation of NCG will be explained. Species concentrations in solution will be explored to ensure long-term passivation under a variety of operating conditions. An understanding of the relation between species concentrations and the resulting surface chemistry will be obtained. Lifetime tests will confirm reliability. Anticipated Outcome and Impact The proposed research will enable engineers to use water in applications heretofore not possible. A better understanding of the role of electrochemistry and thermodynamics in corrosion protection will be developed. The results will yield needed information to enhance the performance of electronic devices ranging from cell phones to high power density devices. The weight savings is accompanied by a significant reduction in material costs. Public Purpose Advances in consumer electronics has necessitated the integration of high performance thermal management only previously needed in power electronics in advanced applications. Many computers, cell phones, LED’s, and batteries at the consumer level have reached thermal design bottlenecks. Increasing the performance of commonly used heat pipes would allow for the continued advances in consumer electronics with longer product lifetimes.less","150,000",2015,2016
0,3D laser absorption imaging of species and temperature in supercritical flames,United States Air Force,to RAYMOND SPEARRIN,"Combustion at supercritical pressures is essential to current and future Air Force propulsion systems due to the acute need for high power density and efficiency. Supercritical mixing and combustion are difficult to model, and quantitative diagnostics paired with controlled high pressure experiments are critical to model advancement. The primary research objective of the proposed effort is to enable and apply a novel three dimensional, quantitative imaging technique for species and temperature in high pressure reacting flows, up to 100 atm. We propose to achieve this objective via two advancements in laser diagnostics. First, state of the art laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) methods will be expanded in spatial resolution capability by utilizing highspeed infrared cameras to image flow fields backlit with tunable infrared laser radiation. The laser absorption imaging (LAI) technique provides for spectrally, spatially, and temporally rich datasets that can be reconstructed using tomographic methods. Second, we will exploit non ideal radiative properties at high gas densities to extend laser absorption spectroscopy techniques to pressures greater than 100 atm for multiple combustion species. In this project, we combine this novel imaging and high pressure spectroscopic strategy for simultaneous measurements of both flame structure and quantitative thermochemistry (temperature, species concentrations) at supercritical conditions (> 50 atm), providing unique capability that does not exist with current diagnostic methods.less","150,000",2019,2022
0,Intra-Subaperture Adaptive Optical (ISAO) System,United States Department of the Air Force,to Jeffrey Barchers,"ABSTRACT: Current and projected limitations on the maximum power from a high power single mode fiber laser amplifier impose architectural limitations on a high power phased array laser weapon system. Prior studies strongly indicate that when faced with this limitation the optimal approach is (to borrow the term for Paul McManamon) a Phased Array of Phased Arrays (PAPA) geometry wherein large(r) subapertures are compensated using an Intra-Subaperture Adaptive Optical (ISAO) system within each subaperture, reducing the number of subapertures that must be phased for the full array [Nutronics, Inc. Conformal Laser Weapon System Phase I Final Report 21 March 2011]. This approach in turn imposes a requirement to compensate for atmospheric aberrations within a subaperture. Our team (comprised of Nutronics, Inc., UCLA, and Optical Physics Company) propose to investigate the trade space of options for ISAO systems and develop a conceptual design for a demonstrator to be developed during a potential follow-on Phase 2 effort. The trade space will include conventional options that utilize a small DM in the subaperture as well as off-loading ISAO wavefront sensor outputs to in-line electro-optic modulators in the outgoing beam path. BENEFIT: The proposed effort has numerous potential benefits and commercial applications, including (but not limited to): laser communication, space situational awareness, astronomical ground based imaging, laser radar, laser rangefinding, aircraft self defense (both commercial and military), air-base defense, ship self-defense, and tactical precision strike.less","149,999",2013,2013
0,Mobile Health Application for Family and Behavioral Health Provider Communication,United States Department of the Army,to Greg Barish,"Clinical monitoring of mental health status has not evolved much from the routine meeting between patient and clinician, which suffers from a lack of quantification, irregular and anecdotal reporting, and does not necessarily include input from caregivers. This is unfortunate given today's technology, where people routinely volunteer to track their own health related behavior, such as exercise and sleep, via smartphone. This same technology could be used by clinicians to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and quality of care - in part by leveraging input from family, as well as patients. To address this opportunity, we propose SupportTeam, a mobile application that collects, analyzes, and monitors the input about the status and behavior of patients suffering from PTSD/TBI. SupportTeam is novel because it includes input from family and caregivers, as well as patients, and uses statistical techniques to better understand behavior and focus treatment. To process the data, SupportTeam will leverage statistical techniques to classify, predict, and analyze the data submitted. Data and results will be securely transmitted and available to the clinician at any time.

This is proposed a path for (a) high brightness mid-IR sources with scalable output power (up to tens of Watts) in a circular diffraction limited beam, and (b) a platform for multifunctional lasers associated with the ability to locally engineer the amplitude, phase, and polarization response of the metasurface. The specific goal of one year program is a proof of concept demonstration of a metasurface VECSEL in the LWIR range (i.e. 8-12 micron). If initial demonstration is successful, we will investigate metasurface VECSELs with dynamically switchable output polarization, as an example of the multi-functional laser concept. The VECSEL is an attractive architecture to achieve high-power single-transverse-mode operation with excellent Gaussian beam quality. While desirable, the VECSEL concept could not ordinarily be implemented for a quantum-cascade laser, because the intersubband selection rule prevents interaction of the gain medium with surface incident radiation. Our group has recently demonstrated the first quantum-cascade VECSEL in the THz frequency range by using a novel metasurface made up of sub-wavelength antenna-coupled sub-cavities loaded with QC-laser gain material; this creates an active amplifying mirror which serves as one mirror in an open cavity. Here we propose to demonstrate the metasurface QC-VECSEL approach in the mid-infrared range. The technological impact is potentially high, as both sensing applications and infrared countermeasures demand high performance mid-IR sources. Novelty lies in the fact that the THz approach cannot simply be scaled to the mid-IR Ð the metallic losses would become excessive and prevent operation.

0,"Vibration imaging for the characterization of extended, non-cooperative targets",United States Department of the Air Force,to Troy Rhoadarmer,"Locating objects that vibrate is a way to discern potential threats and locate targets. However, current vibrometry technology typically measures only the global vibration of target and cannot create an extended spatial measurement of the vibration profile of the target. These solutions cannot identify what the target is, nor can they locate potential weak spots on the target, because they lack spatial information about the target.

0,Spatial variability in aeolian abrasion,United States Department of the Army,to Mackenzie Day,"Wind-driven sediment transport dominates arid landscape evolution. In particular, wind-blown sand forms vast dune fields and erodes exposed surfaces through abrasion. Abrasion requires that sand is entrained by the wind, and aeolian dunes often serve as a sand source for abrasion. However, the relationship between the magnitude of abrasion and distance from a sand source remains poorly constrained. Previous work on aeolian abrasion has focused on ventifacts, wind-carved cobbles and boulders that record the direction of erosive winds in their pattern of surface erosion. These geologic indicators provide robust evidence that wind-abrasion has occurred, but without more information provide little information about the magnitude or rate of surface erosion. At the moment, sources of sand are easy to identify (e.g., dune fields, sand sheets), but the expected erosion rate on materials places some distance away is unknown. Aeolian abrasion can cause significant damage to both natural and engineered materials, but sometimes proximity to sand sources is unavoidable. A quantitative understanding of how aeolian erosion rates vary with material type and distance from a dune field would facilitate better-informed decision making in arid regions, and provide an expected rates of degradation from aeolian abrasion that could be used in planning and risk management. The proposed work aims to address this gap in knowledge. Objective: Quantify the magnitude of aeolian abrasion as a function of distance away from a sand dune source. Technical approach: To determine quantitatively how abrasion varies distally away from a dune field, we propose a 12- month field experiment in which we monitor the wind conditions in the field, capture saltating sand causing abrasion, and measure progressive abrasion-related mass loss on a variety of natural and synthetic materials at increasing distance from the dune field. The proposed work is divided into three major tasks completed over a total of 18 months. Preparatory assembly of sampling devices and initial deployment of those devices in the field (Task 1a) will be conducted at the beginning of the proposal period. Ventifacts in the area will also be mapped as a proxy for geologically recent winds (Task 1b). For the next 12 months, the field area will be visited regularly to track progressive abrasion and monitor the winds and sediment flux (Task 2). Data analysis (Task 3) will be conducted after the 12 months of monitoring. We hypothesize that abrasion decreases linearly away from a sand source. This hypothesis can be directly tested with the proposed field measurements and geologic interpretation. The patterns and magnitude of abrasion at each sample site will provide data to quantify the relationship between distance from the sand source and abrasion date. Additional contextual information will refine the scientific interpretation of these results.less","130,821",2021,2022

Therefore, translating the state-of-the-art catal,ysts developed in laboratories into PEMFCs would greatly improve energy efficiencies and reduce PGM usage associated costs. With ONR, support, the UCLA group has developed various designer nanocatalysts for the PEMFC cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with muc,h higher activity and stability than the commercial ones, some of which even set the record of activities for ORR catalysts.

Such #balanced# motions tend to aggregate intolarger scales, following an inverse cascade of energy. However, alarge part of the energy dissipation needs to happenat much smallerscales. But how energy is transferred from the large scales to thevery small scales are still an open question. Submesoscale currents (1- 10 km) processes can provide a relaxation from the strictgeostrophic balance. They can extract energy from geostrophic flowsand transfer it to unbalanced motions, from where it may be cascadedto smallest scale where irreversible molecular mixing takesplace. Internal waves may also extract energy from the mesoscale orsubmesoscale currents. This collaborative project willinvestigatethese processes in high-resolution, high-frequency simulations of theAtlantic Ocean.less","113,194",2023,2024

0,Thermally Remendable Composite Structures with Resistive Heating Network of Carbon Fibers,United States Department of the Air Force,to Thomas Darlington,"Carbon fiber-reinforced composites undergo subcritical damage well before final failure. A self-healing composite material is proposed that will autonomously sense and repair localized damage in composite structures.  Healing is accomplished via two main components.  The first component is a thermally remendable polymer matrix that is integrated into the structural carbon fiber composite and has the ability to be healed with the application of heat. The second component is an addressable conducting network (ACN) that will both sense resistance changes due to damage in carbon fiber composites as well as deliver current for resistive heating to addressable locations within the composite. A health management system will continuously monitor the health of the structural composite and will determine the location and extent of detected damage as well as the potential for autonomous repair.   BENEFIT: The proposed technology provides a solution to the serious problem of detecting and repairing impact, delamination and microcracking damage in aircraft and vehicles.  Currently, such damage can go undetected resulting in a compromised structure that can endanger personnel and reduce mission readiness.  The software developed in conjunction with the novel structural designs developed within this program will allow maintenance personnel to continuously monitor the health of composite structures. When damage is detected, a healing procedure can be initiated to rapidly restore the integrity of the structure. Commercial and military aircraft are increasingly constructed from carbon fiber, and the proposed monitoring and healing technology will reduce maintenance cost and increase service lifetimes of composite air frames.  The ability to monitor the health as well as address structural issues remotely will provide an unprecedented ability to maintain inaccessible composite structures such as satellite and space vehicles.)less","100,000",2009,2010

Ethnographic data has become highly important in counterinsurgency as well as in conventional combat planning and decisions. While there are many existing and new tools that can help military personnel rapidly gather such data even in risky and/or denied areas, the potentially available tools are not integrated into one accessible system and are not easily used by non-specialist personnel. Moreover, ethnographic analyses are most often divorced from overall planning and decision making. Our solution to these problems is to combine a number key social network, planning and decision support components that we are developing in several closely related SBIR projects with new ethnographic analysis components. This will create a customized and productized tool suite that enhances ethnographic data collection and analysis and visualization, puts the data into a planning and decision making framework, and most important can be quickly transitioned to operational users, both in the military and in commercial environments.less","100,000",2011,2011

Numerous social network visualization systems have been produced in recent years. But even in the few top systems cognitive science and design principles have been applied in an ad hoc and non-systemic manner. Accordingly, each visualization system is a one-of, which may be fine-tuned to a particular user goal and data set, but which can not adapt to rapidly changing user goals, data sets and visualization techniques. In our new approach, visualizations will be automatically generated based on user-defined goals, data set characteristics, and first principles in cognitive science. This will be a systematic and rigorous process, in which various visualization techniques are evaluated based on their utility for the current user goals and data set, as well as the compatibility of their underlying cognitive premises. The key innovation in our system is the explicit inclusion of all of these factors in an automated design process through the use of taxonomies for cognitive principles, visualization techniques, and user-goals. ADVIS will permit user-goals and visualization techniques to be specified and added to the system, so that optimal visualizations can be rapidly produced.less","100,000",2012,2012

0,Target Scene Resolution and Calibration Using Innovative Region Based Active Contour Techniques,Missile Defense Agency,to Berta Sandberg,"During terminal homing, when the interceptor aim point is guided principally by its IR seeker, there are many events within the seeker field of view (FOV) that can contribute to a failure to intercept. Some major events and associated IR image phenomena are: (1) Booster intensity overwhelming the intensity of the hard body. (2) Re-entry vehicle (RV) separation from a post boost vehicle (PBV), and (3) transient shock wave for an endo-atmospheric intercept. Given the stressing timelines of KEI, there is a need to quickly and accurately determine the precise location of the physical centroid of a ballistic missile hard body in order to find the desired point of intercept for the kill vehicle. A recently developed set of image processing algorithms developed at the UCLA Math Department will help solve this problem. These algorithms will differentiate several objects of different intensities, using the image data directly to find the centroid of the hard body. In this context, the only detection heuristic is that there may be more than one object within the images. The proposed image processing algorithms will be combined in an integrated fashion with the physical dynamics of the plume, shock wave and hard body. Our algorithms include feature detection, identification, tracking, and aim point selection. Approaches that will be investigated will include the following: 1. Image segmentation (active contour methods) to detect the separate parts of the boosting missile; 2. Use the object region rather then edge information for tracking; and 3. Considering that the image may be noisy. This approach has been successfully demostrated in a laboratory environment at UCLA on MIR ans commerciaal avaition applications.less","100,000",2004,2005

0,Joint Transport and Routing Optimization for Adaptive Satellite Networks,United States Department of the Air Force,to Alain Teil,"ABSTRACT: Efficient routing strategies combined with robust transport protocols are paramount in new generations of satellite networks which encompass diverse constellations located at different orbits. Compared to older bent pipe satellite systems with no onboard IP routing and processing schemes, the newer generations offer a lot more flexibility. Accordingly, the impact of cross-layer approaches and joint optimization of routing and transport protocols need to be investigated for heterogeneous GEOstationary (GEO) + Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. To respond to this challenge, we propose Joint Transport and Routing Optimization for Adaptive Satellite Networks (JTRO-ASN). This powerful framework intends to boost network usage and to improve end to end performances over satellite channels. JTRO-ASN sense and exploit network and transport parameters, using adaptive schemes to enable the protocol stack to maximize system efficiency. The aforementioned cooperative mechanism, by bypassing the strict OSI layer boundaries facilitates dynamic information distribution and exploitation where it is needed. JTRO-ASN can handle diverse aggressive space channel conditions employing adaptive protocols customized for satellite networks applications. A cross-layer technique grants the stack layers to share relevant information to facilitate exploitation of the data. JTRO-ASN improves overall network throughput and latency. For a given domain, additional flows are supported simultaneously over several links. Furthermore, JTRO-ASN delivers enhanced reliability, robustness, and scalability in dynamic network situations. The JTRO-ASN methodology is an ideal choice to provide the most favorable route, the finest transport protocol tuning, and the best possible link management in harsh space conditions. BENEFIT: In order to meet the modern military mission critical operation requirements, secure, high bandwidth for a large number of heterogeneous war-fighting users is required. UC""s proposed IP-based satellite network architecture will greatly benefit the Air Force""s satellite communication programs by enabling the linkage of user preferences and network conditions, and significantly reducing both latency between network nodes, and transmission failures, among other identified objectives. UC""s technologies will greatly enhance communications at the tactical edges, increasing mission efficiency and effectiveness and enhancing Air Force program objectives overall. Moreover, an enhanced and effective broadband satellite communications system is a critical component of the DoD""s force transformation to a network centric state. Defense: Key Structural changes outlined in the U.S. DoD""s FY 2011 budget will increase demand for secure, broadband satellite communications through increases in targeted personnel such as Special Forces, as well transformation of Army Multi-functional and Functional Support (MFF) brigades to a modular design [K11]. Enhanced satellite capabilities will, under the future paradigm, be driven down through the brigade to the company level. The growth rate of the military satellite communications sector is projected at 5.6 percent annual growth over the next ten years, dependent on the advent of critical enabling technologies like what UC proposes here [F10]. Current DoD programs which would benefit from UC""s enabling satellite communications technologies include numerous ISR programs which will require significantly increased and reliable communications capabilities to deliver performance projections, as well as the UAVs which carry the ISR payloads and communicate with other mobile machines. Specific programs include the Global Hawk vehicles and the upgraded Predator drone, Gray Eagle. Transition opportunities for the proposed technologies exist within the Wideband Global SATCOM Deployment (currently consisting of 6 satellites, $182 million was recently authorized to start work on a seventh satellite, with as many as 12 WGS satellites in the projected pipeline). UC is determined to demonstrate success with the Air Force as its initial customer and then expand its product offering to other service branches and agencies. To ensure a successful transition of the technology, UC""s strategy includes partnering with Lockheed Martin Space Systems during Phases I and Phase II to facilitate efficient development and transition of the technology into their ongoing programs.

The world Satellite Machine-to-Machine communications sector of MSS supports applications used for logistical tracking, telemetry, remote monitoring, geo fencing, security, and scientific monitoring, providing various benefits for industries ranging from agriculture to retail. This sector is strongly dominated by the United States which holds 62 percent market share and its revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2016 [D10]. UC will analyze optimal transition plans and entry points within this value chain over the course of Phases I and II to effectively maximize the commercial potential of the proposed technology. Commercial Transition: During Phase I, UC will conduct research to identify optimal product insertion points and will address key market questions to establish the commercial viability of the proposed technology and establish the right relationships to develop the technology for the commercial markets. UC will identify additional potential vendors and partners and engage in discussions with them and their key suppliers and partners to ensure timely and cost-effective distribution of the proposed technology. UC will establish an ongoing dialogue with program managers of divisions through which transition of the technology is anticipated and contracting partners to identify user requirements and facilitate a seamless technical and commercial transition in Phase II and beyond. UC will also leverage its existing relationships with Program Managers within the Air Force and Lockheed Martin to gather user requirements and establish testing protocols early, facilitating a more efficient transition into the marketplace.

Boundary layer transition has first-order impacts on aerodynamic heating, as well as drag and control of hypersonic vehicles. The success of transition and related heating prediction relies on the good understanding of the relevant physical mechanisms leading to transition.

The purpose of this STTR Phase I effort is to develop, validate, and demonstrate a robust and accurate DNS computational tool for predicting wall heat transfer rates in transitional hypersonic boundary layers. The DNS can also predict the heat transfer overshoot at transition. The main idea is to develop DNS tools for the simulation of complete transition process of hypersonic boundary layers over blunt cones under realistic freestream noise and other disturbances. There are four specific research tasks to be carried out in a nine month period for the proposed STTR Phase I project. First, we will develop and validate a prototype 3-D DNS computer code for hypersonic boundary-layer transition and heat transfer prediction. Second, we will validate the new DNS computational tool against benchmark experimental datasets obtained from the open literature. Third, we will conduct some initial DNS of boundary layer transition on hypersonic boundary layer over a blunt cone for Mach 5.5 flow over blunt cones, which correspond to Stetsons shock tunnel experiments. The transition simulation consists of separate receptivity and nonlinear breakdown simulations. Fourth, we will begin efforts for developing a product usable by a non-specialist, and formulate plan for Phase II development.

Furthermore, efficiency decreases by 0.5% for every degree increase in operating temperature. In order to increase the efficiency of the conversion of solar radiation per unit area to electricity it becomes advantageous to combine the solar cell with a thermal energy harvester. Acting as a thermal backplane, the thermal energy harvester increases the efficiency of the solar cell itself by keeping the solar cell from overheating, as well as allows for the harvesting of additional energy in the form of the suns""heat [2]. For this approach to be successful a thermal energy harvester possessing a high efficiency, high power density and that can be manufactured in a compact thin module is necessary. The magneto-thermoelectric generator developed by researchers at UCLA has the potential to possess such properties. As such, Maritime Applied Physics Corporation (MAPC) in collaboration with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) proposes to combine the magneto-thermoelectric generator with solar cells to create an efficient and power dense hybrid solar energy harvester. BENEFIT: MAPC foresees numerous applications for the proposed technology. Applications are available for both the stand alone thermal energy harvesting (i.e. with the magneto-thermoelectric energy harvester) where solar energy is not available as well as the proposed hybrid energy harvester where solar energy is readily available. Potential markets for our technology exist in industries employing a broad range of portable and remote low power electronic devices would benefit from a high power density thermal energy harvester. Low power electronic devices primarily exist in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used for applications such as condition monitoring, and in radio frequency identification (RFID) tags used, among other things, for inventory tracking. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), could be expanded with additional nodes, functionality and accelerated rate of data transmission utilizing our proposed technology. Sensor networks and clusters, found today in health monitoring of oil refineries, power plants, civilian structures (e.g., bridges), aircraft, automobiles, ships and trains, could be powered via harvested waste heat, with an attendant reduction in the use of batteries.less","99,666",2011,2011

0,Plasmonics for Solar Energy Generation,United States Department of the Air Force,to Vladimir Kochergin,"Photovoltaics, while promising clean and reliable energy source, is not yet compatible with fossil energy for most applications. Organic-based solar cells have potential to reduce the cost of solar energy due to low-cost active materials, high-throughput reel-to-reel deposition technologies, low-temperature processing and application versatility. Currently organic photovoltaics (OPV) cannot commercially compete with inorganic devices due to low conversion efficiencies. The team of MicroXact and UCLA DRL proposes to extend absorption of OPV down to infrared region and at the same time greatly enhance carriers transport. Such OPV device will provide the conversion efficiency at the level of standard silicon photovoltaic technology, while keeping all the benefits of OPV technology, such as flexibility and possibility for low cost production. The proposed photovoltaic device will effectively marry low cost/flexibility of presently developed OPV devices with high conversion efficiency of inorganic solar cells. The proprietary structure will significantly enhance the absorption of the solar radiation in the active layer of the solar cell, providing the opportunity to use much thinner active layers, which in turn allows highly efficient transport of the free carriers to the collecting electrodes. BENEFIT: Due to constant increase in fossil energy cost and insecurity in oil and gas supplies, the photovoltaic industry experiences tremendous growth. The scenarios from future prospects for the PV industry yield a range of annual worldwide industry revenues of between $18.6bn and $31.5bn by 2011. Thin film (TF) PV market is predicted to be the fastest growing segment with current volume of $1.6bn before climbing to almost $3.4bn in 2010 and 7.2 in 2015, TF PV will penetrate the PV markets by offering a more cost-competitive solution than traditional PVs for many applications, as by opening up new applications through TF PV''s unique properties which include low weight, flexibility, and ability to be embedded into other materials. The most crippling limitation on conventional PV today is the high cost production. Organic PV can address this and other limitations to open up new applications for solar energy due to low cost of active materials, high-throughput reel-to-reel deposition technologies, low-temperature processing, defect tolerance, and application versatility.less","99,340",2010,2010

We propose to create antennas on existing structures or other parts of the platform using either of two strategies: (i) by developing efficient antenna""exciters""that can efficiently couple power to existing metallic structures (such as fences, roofs, posts and drain-pipes or even vehicles, hull plates and armor); and (ii) by incorporating conductive paints that can be applied to walls and other non-metallic structures. By utilizing these techniques we believe we can resolve the fundamental issue of developing an efficient HF antenna that is not unwieldy and can be readily transported. We also plan to investigate how to interconnect these potential HF radiators using sparse array concepts to further enhance the overall efficiency.

To address this need, Scalable Networks and UCLA propose to develop a real-time scenario-based Tactical Radio Channel Simulator (TRCS) capable of incorporating effects due to factors such as vegetation, terrain, seasonal conditions, atmospheric conditions in various environments including urban, forest, open ocean, and deserts. Other factors that will be modeled in TRCS are standard fading profiles, inter-symbol interference; the mobility impacts of hills, valleys, foliage, and vehicle speed; the altitude and speed of aircraft; antenna blockages due to host platform characteristics; and the presence of intentional and unintentional interference. This simulation-based model will output propagation data in a format suitable for driving hardware-based channel emulators. The TRCS will also provide graphical tools to configure the TRCS simulation and analyze its output data. In Phase I of this effort we will determine the feasibility of and develop a conceptual design for a modular RF simulation, prediction, and visualization tool which when connected to hardware channel emulators can apply realistic channel effects to communication between live radios.less","79,945",2011,2011
0,Ionogel-Based Solid Electrolytes for Sodium-Ion Batteries,United States Department of the Navy,to Bruce Dunn,"This is a new NURP project between UCLA and NRL.Improve the safety of sodium-ion batteries by utilizing sodium-ion conducting ionogel electrolytes which are designed to overcome these problems. The ionogel approach is based on the use of sol-gel synthesis methods to encapsulate, within an inorganic matrix, ionic liquids which offer unique thermal, chemical and electrochemical properties. Abstract:The current generation of rechargeable sodium-ion batteries are emerging as an alternative energy storage technology that avoids some of the limitations of lithium-ion battery technology, especially with respect to safety and long-term economic viability. The next step towards improving the safety of sodium-ion batteries is to move towards solid-state battery systems. Prior experience with lithium-based solid state batteries has shown that the solid electrolyte is the principal component that limits this technology because of low ionic conductivity and the presence of an interfacial resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte. In this proposal we will develop sodium-ion conducting ionogel electrolytes which are designed to overcome these problems. The ionogel approach is based on the use of sol-gel synthesis methods to encapsulate, within an inorganic matrix, ionic liquids which offer unique thermal, chemical and electrochemical properties. In this program we plan to create a range of sodium-ion conducting ionogels and establish a fundamental understanding of the factors determining their transport properties and electrochemical behavior. It is only from such a fundamental study that we will be able to achieve the necessary ionic conductivity and especially the low interfacial resistance required for sodium-ion solid-state batteries. An important emphasis in our studies will be to determine the effect of chemistry and microstructure on transport properties and to control confinement effects so that ionogels can be used at low temperatures. Another important component to this program will be to investigate the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces for systems that incorporate Na+ ionogels. This research will take place primarily at the NRL and will involve the investigation of ionogels integrated with both anode and cathode materials that would make up an ultimate Na-ion cell. We expect that the sodium-ion conducting ionogels from this program will enable the development of sodium solid-state batteries that overcome the transport and interfacial problems that have plagued earlier generations of solidstate batteries.less","75,000",2017,2020

The photovoltaic sheet will consist of an array of inelastic solar cells connected in series by stretchable conductive interconnects. The interconnects will be either corrugated metal or a serpentine wire. Cells and interconnects will be embedded in an elastic polymer sheet that will provide the elastic response to an externally-applied strain and protect the cells from the environment.

For ease of manufacture, the cells will be fabricated so that access to only one side is needed to fabricate the interconnects.

0,Commercialization of Rate Sensitive Low Density Polyurea-Based Viscoelastic Foams For Head Health Applications,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Vijay Gupta,"This proposal seeks commercialization of a new class of polyurea-based viscoelastic foams with a novel microstructure for Head Health applications that outperform the state of the art polyurethane foams and their currently marketed protective headgear products by a significant margin when tested in various industry and government standard helmet tests. The transmitted gÕs through the same foam thickness (0.5Ó-1Ó) in ACH and Riddell football helmets are reduced by an additional 18% to 320%, depending upon the magnitude of the impact force and test temperature. The superior properties of the UCLA foams are due to their unique microstructure that comprises of large polyhedral cells (300Àm -500Àm) covered with perforated membranes with small apertures (20Àm-70Àm). This makes them strain rate sensitive as the rate at which the air escapes the cells depends upon the loading rate. Thus, even with their uniform microstructure, they behave as an elastically modulated layered composite because the cells stiffen or soften in response to the changing loading rate within the same impact event. Remarkably these multiple-hit viscoelastic foams absorb more energy compared to single-hit Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) material under very high strain rates (1000s-1-5000s-1). These foams are therefore ideal for military helmets which unlike sports and consumer helmets are subjected to blast waves that cause TBI to our warfighters. UCLA foams also derive their impact resistant property from the novel polymer that forms its skeleton. It has a Tg of -50¡C and has a polyurea backbone structure whose soft and hard domains not only remain stable up to 50¡C but undergo relative sliding at very low shear stress. These molecular relaxation processes attain maximum efficiency when the foamÕs cellular structure buckle, bend, and twist to generate very large local shear strains during foam compression. These dissipative processes operate at both very low (-15¡C) and high temperature (50¡C) conditions where their polyurethane counterparts either become glassy or their structure deteriorate to result in total loss of their impact properties. Through coordinated efforts with several industry partners (Riddell, Full90, OÕNeal Helmets, Skechers, STX, Under Armour), optimized foam chemistries and associated lab manufacturing processing steps for several applications have been created. I Corps grant money will be used for commercialization of two lab scale processes and foam recipes that have been developed for Head Health applications as they represent current business opportunities with our industry partners. Foam A with a density of 95kg/m3 is designed to work with a helmet shell, whereas Foam B with a density of 170 kg/m3is designed to withstand impact forces without any shell for soft helmet, soccer headbands, and skull cap markets. There is tremendous potential for use in the military and bicycle helmet markets where the standards require rigorous low and high temperature testing. OÕNeal has the capability and manufacturing capacity to make military helmets for purchase by DoD using the UCLA foams after successful conclusion of the I Corps program. The UCLA I-Corps Teamª consists of Vijay Gupta, who will serve as the PI, Brian Ramirez, a Ph.D. student, will act as the Entrepreneurial Lead, and Eric Schiffer, an active angel investor and former CEO of 99¢ Only Stores with over $1.7 billion of sales and 330 stores, will act as the Mentor. At the conclusion of the I Corps program, G-Foam Technologies (GFT), a UCLA Startup, will be launched. It will actively pursue licensing deals with our industry partners. GFT will license all of Gupta patents from UCLA-OIP. Through the mentorship of Eric Schiffer and training under the I Corps program, both PI Gupta and EL Ramirez would be entrepreneurially competitive.

Unfortunately, wireless networks in mobile environments face formidable challenges – from radio propagation effects to external jamming, path breakage and intermittent connectivity. Current radio platforms are not adequate for the challenge. While awaiting for more sophisticated radios (eg, SDRs and MIMO radios) that will alleviate the problem using physical layer techniques, in this Phase I project we propose to develop a “thin” software layer that transparently interacts with other layers. The thin layer exploits and in fact manages preexisting layer “redundancies” such as multiple paths and link layer retransmissions. The thin layer will support two independent coding techniques, namely, erasure/rateless coding (at the end-to-end level) and network coding (at the packet forwarding level).

0,Developing trapped ion technology for inertial sensing,United States Department of the Navy,to Paul Hamilton,"Gyroscopes based on atom interferometry have long held promise of greater absolute stabilitycompared to their solid state and optical counterparts by leveraging the universal properties ofatoms. With atomic beam gyroscopes there has been a tradeoff ~ in order to get a large enclosedarea to increase their sensitivity to rotations, the devices must be large (meter scale). On theother hand, optical interferometers have been made compact without sacrificing sensitivity bypassing light through thousands of loops of optical fiber to increase the enclosed area.We introduce a new technique that combines the advantages of both technologies ~ a trapped ionSagnac interferometer. Trapping is analogous to an optical fiber for ions, allowing potentiallythousands of orbits to accumulate the area enclosed by the interferometer. By using a harmonictrap, we also avoid the velocity-dependent sensitivity in typical atomic gyroscopes. We projectthat by combining demonstrated technologies, a trapped ion gyroscope with a random walk errorof 0.0048 degrees per root hr is feasible. In addition, techniques for preparing high-qualityentangled quantum states borrowed from quantum information processing furnish this newtechnology with a route to sub-shot noise sensitivity.We will create a single-ion Sagnac interferometer by first placing the ion in a superposition oftwo wavepackets taking oppositely directed orbits around the trap center. This superposition willbe created using demonstrated technology originally developed for ultrafast quantum computingknown as ~spin dependent kicks~ (SDKs), which map the ion~s qubit state to a superposition ofits external momentum states. This will be followed by a displacement of the ion from the trapcenter using trap electrodes to create the desired coherent superposition of orbits. If the ion trapitself rotates as the wavepackets orbit, the Sagnac effect will lead to a phase difference that wewill measure after reversing these displacements to recombine the wavepackets.The unique regime in which this interferometer operates endows it with some intriguingproperties. The sensitivity to rotation in our anticipated operating regime should be larger than asingle spin gyroscope by a factor of the ratio of their angular momenta, where the ion~s orbitalangular momentum in the trap is roughly 350,000 hbar. Since the Lorentz force from a static Bfieldis equivalent in form to the Coriolis force, an applied field can be applied to maintain fullinterference contrast and fringe phase independent of rotation rate, a technique we refer to as the~magnetic gimbal.~ Feedback of the fringe signal to the coils applying the field closes the loop,and the coil current becomes the gyroscope signal, thereby providing potential for a widedynamic range of measurement timescales and rotation rates with no loss of contrast.Furthermore, since the magnetic moment of the orbit is suppressed compared to an electron by afactor of the ratio of the electron mass to the mass of a 171Yb+ ion, the magnetic field sensitivityassociated with this effective spin-350,000 system is only about 1 Bohr magneton.less","50,400",2017,2020
0,Spin Waves Generated by Elastic Waves,United States Department of the Army,to Gregory Carman,"This research studies aimes to demonstrate that spin waves (magnons) can be efficiently generated using acoustic waves and that these acoustic waves can drive the spin waves over large distances (by orders of magnitude) compared to the propagation distances of spin waves alone. The proposed research consists of theoretical modeling, fabrication, and testing. Theoretical modeling will be based on previous work at UCLA on coupled micromagnetic and elastodynamic equations, which include exchange coupling, magneto-crystal anisotropy, Zeeman energy, demagnetization effects, and magnetoelastic energy. To fabricate the device structures for investigation, a Ni spin bus will be deposited on a piezoelectric substrate. A series of microantennas are deposited as spin wave signal detectors along the length of the bus, while an elastic wave transducer will be fabricated at the end of the spin bus. Two devices types will be compared, one using surface acoustic excitation at the beginning of the spin bus and the other using magnetic field excitation via a microantenna. The first device type generates a spin wave via strain mediated coupling of the acoustic wave in the piezoelectric material to the magnetoelastic Ni. The second device generates a spin wave in the Ni directly via magnetic coupling. The differences in propagation distance of the spin waves will be measured, analyzed in the model, and evaluated to understand the relevant physical mechanisms.less","50,000",2016,2017
0,Broadening the Efficiency Bandwidth Product of Electrically small Antenna through Direct Antenna Modulation (DAM) Transmitting,United States Department of the Army,to Yuanxun Wang,"This STIR proposal is to demonstrate high efficiency broadband HF transmission based on the novel concept of Direct Antenna Modulations (DAM). The proposed effort takes a system approach rather than isolated antenna design to attack the famous Chu-HarringtonÕs limit e.g. the limit of efficiency bandwidth product, associated with electrically small antennas or radiation platforms. The effort will bring forth innovations on both the operating principles and hardware architectures of HF transmitters. On the transmitter operating principles, the proposed efforts utilize the nonlinear, dynamic nature of device-antenna interactions to achieve antenna performance beyond conventional limits. It has been demonstrated that a high-speed switch can change the nature of a narrow-band resonant antenna to a high-speed pulse radiator. The so-called switched-mode antenna is capable of breaking the bandwidth limit of a high-Q system in a direct antenna modulation manner by introducing nonlinear dynamics in a synchronized fashion with the RF carrier to be transmitted. Circuit simulations and preliminary experiments have demonstrated that the efficiency bandwidth product limit of electrically small loop antennas can now be surpassed.less","50,000",2016,2017
0,Neural mechanism for reafference rejection during voluntary saccades,United States Department of the Army,to Mark . Frye,"This proposal seeks to identify the neural circuitry underlying how a motor command suppresses corrective visual reflexes during visual tracking in drosophila. Tasking to achieve the objective of this proposal will involve optogenetics, quantitative analysis of behavior in virtual reality, and multi-photon imaging to reveal how visual stability reflexes are modified by visuo-motor commands during flight in the fruit fly. Using a 'virtual reality' flight simulator, the proposer will test the hypothesis that the visual system of flies rejects self-generated visual information via neural inhibition. The proposer will take advantage of the molecular genetic techniques available in Drosophila in order to manipulate neural circuits, and study in-vivo calcium dynamics from identified neural circuitry in flying flies. The experimental goal is to record activity of visual processing intemeurons during voluntary saccades to identify visual processes that are inhibited during saccades by the process of feedforward reafference rejection. Individual flies are tethered onto a custom microscope stage within a virtual-reality arena identical to those used in behavioral experiments that enables multi-photon imaging of cellular circuits while flies can freely beat their wings. Visual stimuli will be displayed that evokes flight steering saccades. Wing movements of flies are tracked in real-time while simultaneously recording the activity of candidate interneurons using 2-photon excitation calcium imaging. Using a video system to track the beating wings, proposer will compare the Ca2+ activity of identified visual interneurons before, during, and after voluntary saccades.less","50,000",2015,2016
0,Non-Contact Ultrasonic Imaging,United States Department of the Army,to Seth Putterman,"Ultrasound provides an excellent method of imaging objects embedded within a medium having high water content. For example, at a frequency of 2 MHz, the imaging resolution is on the order of a millimeter. The dramatic mismatch of acoustic impedance between air and water, however, typically necessitates good acoustic contact between the transducer and the medium to be studied. This mismatch causes the transmitted intensity to drop by a factor of one thousand from that incident on the boundary. This difficulty in directly coupling acoustic energy into the medium via an air gap is the fundamental reason why non-contact ultrasound imaging remains infeasible. We propose to overcome this long standing problem by developing new methods of coupling into the medium at standoff. In particular, we believe that the acoustic nonlinearity of both the air and the medium may yield a range of effects in the vicinity of the surface permitting an efficient transmission of ultrasound from the air into the medium. Experimentally, we have conducted this study by directing commercially available sources of 45 and 96 kHz ultrasound beams at the air-water free surface and measuring acoustic transmission and surface deformation.less","50,000",2015,2016
0,Towards Provably Secure Malware Defenses,United States Department of the Army,to Rafail Ostrovsky,"Protecting systems from malware injection is the holy grail of modern computer science. Despite the intensive efforts by the scientific and engineering community, the number of successful attacks continues to increase. This situation poses a clear threat to science and to society as a whole. The lack of mechanisms and metrics to evaluate the security of suggested defenses is arguably a major obstacle in scientific progress that could lead us to a generation of more robust and/or resilient systems. Indeed, most, if not all, existing practical approaches are typically heuristic and there is no formal proof that they are either efficient or effective, nor is there a way to evaluate and/or compare them; rather, their performance and accuracy are typically experimentally validated. The coPIs recently proposed the ultimate method for security assurance of malware detection mechanisms. Concretely, we proposed a paradigm shift in malware defense from the traditional Òproof by experimentÓ methodology to the design of provably secureÀin a strict mathematical senseÀand composable defenses. This sets first footsteps towards the development of a rigorous mathematic theory of secure malware defensesÀincluding a model of computation and an adversary model. The first milestones demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed paradigm-shift can be found in our inaugural paper [1] and are outlined in the project description. When successful, our breakthrough technology will apply universally from computers and smartphones to controllers of critical infrastructure, e.g., nuclear reactors and medical devices. Moreover, our research will open a channel for ideas-flow between low-interacting disciplines such as theoretical computer science and systems engineering to attack the malware problem. Importantly, in [1] we have provided a high-level specification of a secure malware detection mechanism. The key idea of our method is to use the very insertion of the malware itself to allow for the systems to detect it. This is close in spirit to the famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The attackers, no matter how clever, no matter when or how they insert their malware, change the state of the system they are attacking. This fundamental idea is a game changer. And the resulting system does not rely on heuristics; its security can be based on mathematics and not on Òproof by experimentÓ. Thus the security claims do will need emulations that could potentially be faulty to back them up. The proposed research aims to advance the above idea towards development of a first working system. We request a nine-month support via the ARLÕs short-term innovative research (STIR) program to establish a proof of concept implementation and first benchmarks to (1) demonstrate that our approach is not only provably secureÀthis is established by our security proofsÀbut it is also practically efficient, and (2) provide pointers on how to extend our security model and schemes to capture as a wide attack surface as possible. The potential impact of our discovery on the computer industry could be comparable to how Jonas SalkÕs polio vaccine revolutionized medicine. Just as universal immunization with the vaccine eradicated polio, universal implementation of the proposed technology could eradicate an entire class of malware. Combined with its composability, our idea makes the first step toward a modular approach to eradicate malware, where defenses against subclasses are combined to yield an ultimately secure system. Given the simplicity and rigorous mathematical proofs of the approach, the success of our research will make it a matter of time until these systems are broadly deployed in modern systems. Given the current state of increasingly frequent and devastating attacks on computer systems, such a breakthrough idea can have without a doubt a great impact to both the scientific community and the general public.less","50,000",2017,2018
0,Thermonuclear Fusion in a Cavitating Fluid Whose Incompressibility Arises From Fermi Repulsion,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Seth Putterman,"Despite the enormous interest in reaching controlled thermonuclear fusion as a source of limitless energy there exists no laboratory scale thermal fusion device. Even for efficiencies Q<<1 a single PI laboratory scale thermal fusion instrument would be transformational. Such a device would become an experimental test bed for a spectrum of innovative ideas aimed at improving Q and understanding this process under wide ranging conditions. This proposed project is motivated by the phenomenon of sonoluminescence [SL] whereby the passage of a sound wave through a fluid creates picosecond flashes of ultraviolet light. The conversion of sound to light involves the spontaneous concentration of the energy density of sound by 12 orders of magnitude. A bubble of gas extracts energy from the sound field by expanding during its rarefaction and then concentrates that energy to its interior during a subsequent implosion that reaches supersonic velocities. In a wide range of parameter space that includes fluids such a water, and gases such as Helium, Xenon, Hydrogen, the emission spectrum is a blackbody with temperatures between 10,000K to 20,000K. The temperatures reached in SL are limited by the compressibility of the host fluid. Fluids such as water are compressible due to the weakness of the hydrogen bond and drain energy from the collapsing bubble. In contrast to water the bulk modulus of a pressurized molten salt is due to the coulomb repulsion and Fermi exchange force that resist overlapping electron shells. These are the strongest repulsive forces in nature. This project will theoretically investigate the conditions under which cavitation in highly incompressible fluids can be used to reach temperatures in excess of 5MK and so be in the regime of thermal fusion when the contents include Deuterium or Tritium.less","50,000",2020,2021

0,"Conference on Spin Coherence, Condensation and Superfluidity",United States Department of the Army,to Yaroslav Tserkovnyak,"The conference program builds upon the recent foremost advances in spintronics: from spin Seebeck and spin Hall effects to spin superfluidity. The agenda is structured around the collective spin-coherent transport phenomena in magnetic insulators. The overarching goal in this field is to establish regimes of low-dissipation classical and quantum spin dynamics, as exemplified by the magnonic condensates and spin superfluids. Antiferromagnets are emerging as materials that are central to these efforts, with ferromagnets and frustrated spin liquids also playing important roles as conceptual and practical testbeds for some of the key ideas. The main emphasis in the conference will be put on different scenarios and regimes of magnon condensates and the associated superfluid transport of spin and energy. The broad expertise of the proposed experimental participants reflects the richness of the tools that are necessary to induce, control, and probe nonequilibrium spin states in magnetic insulators, both the precursors to and the actual condensates.These include spin Hall and spin Seebeck effects for thermoelectric injection and detection of spin transport, Brillouin light scattering and diamond NV centers for probing collective spin states and dynamics, integration with classical and quantum microwave circuitry, as well as a range of emergent magnetoresistive, magnetoelectric, and magnetoelastic tools that are sensitive to spin textures and dynamics. Theoretical emphasis will be placed on the ideas for realizing spin condensates in and out of equilibrium and exhibiting their fascinating transport properties. These concern the effectively easy-plane magnetic materials, the parametrically pumped classical magnonic condensates, and the thermoelectrically pumped Bose-Einstein condensates.The ensuing superfluidity, its two-fluid characteristics for the coupled spin and heat flows, and the onset of the macroscopic quantum coherence at low temperatures constitute the backbone of the program. The low-dissipation room-temperature collective spin transport and its promise for spin interconnects and logic (based on the interplay of the spin superfluidity and the domain-wall motion) will be addressed as a promising outlet for novel device ideas. The recent rapid strides in the underlying theoretical ideas and the concurrent impressive experimental advances are promising to foment an explosive development of this field. This conference, which is first of a kind, is not only timely but is needed to organize and direct the collaborative efforts by the key scientists. The objectives of building up novel phenomenologies for robust low-dissipation spin transport and dynamics, both at low and high temperatures, should be of strategic relevance to the scientific and technological interests of the US Army.less","35,000",2017,2018

The requested instrumentation will allow the generation of high frequency acoustic waves, their direction into an interface, and measurement of the acoustic signal in the interface, in order to understand the details of non-linear conversions at the interface itself. Theoretical analysis indicates that the phase and momenta relationships of multiple acoustic beams intersecting an interface can be optimized to significantly enhance transmission of the non-linear product signals across the interface. Additionally a material interface is often capable of supporting unique modes that may mediate bulk acoustic modes on either side of an interface via nonlinear resonances. The first interface to be investigated is the air / water inferface. Success with this interface will encourage progression to the interface between air and a human body surrogate.

The goal is to develop computationally defined models of brain information processing that explain rich measurements of brain activity and behavior. Such models will ultimately have to perform feats of intelligence such as perception, internal modelling and memory of the environment, decision-making, planning, action, and motor control under naturalistic conditions. Historically, differentdisciplines have met subsets of these goals. Cognitive science has developed computational models at the cognitive level to explain aspects of complex behavior. Computational neuroscience has developed neurobiologically plausible computational models to explain neuronal responses to sensory stimuli and certain low-dimensional decision, memory, andcontrol processes. Cognitive neuroscience has mapped a broad range of cognitive processes onto brain regions. Artificial intelligence has developed models that perform feats of intelligence. The community must now put the pieces of the puzzle together, and CCN is unique in its focus on the intersection between these fields. CCN is envisioned not only as an engine for advancingresearch, but as a vehicle for making broader impacts on education and society. As evidenced by the recent trend of major corporate acquisitions of AI startups founded by neuroscientists, biological inspiration for electronics and software development is a growing trend with significant economic implications.

ITQW is a workshop-style conference that aims to bring together academic, government, and industry scientists in an intimate venue to encourage close interaction and collaboration. Participation in ITQW is international. It is deliberately kept small Ð approximately 100-120 people to ensure a single track format. The conference will feature a mixture of oral presentations, poster sessions, invited and plenary presentations. Requested funding will support this conference in the form of participant support for the registration costs of student attendees in the form of a registration subsidy. The theme of the conference is broadly defined as the exploration of novel physical phenomena in quantum- and electromagnetically-engineered photonic materials in the infrared and terahertz frequency range and the exploitation of these phenomena to create novel optoelectronic devices and applications. The infrared and terahertz frequency range is particularly interesting for realizing practical devices based on these design principles owing to relaxed fabrication tolerances, low loss of metals, controllable plasmonic and nonlinear optical properties of semiconductors and 2D materials, and our ability to engineer intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. In addition there will be a half day Òfocused sessionsÓ where we will focus on the emerging topic of ÒPolaritionics and Strongly Coupled Phenomena.Ó Specifically, a major focus of ITQW is discussion of quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) and interband cascade lasers (ICLs) in the mid-infrared and terahertz, and detectors such as quantum-well and quantum-dot infrared photodetectors (QWIPs and QDIPs), as well as type-II superlattices.

Developments in computational and experimental hardware, numerical algorithms, and unsteady measurement techniques have enabled not only detailed analysis of flow physics but also initiated cross-talks amongst the various disciplines of fluid mechanics. With these powerful toolsets now available, the fluid dynamics community has started to examine complex flows with high levels of unsteadiness, nonlinearity, and multi-scale dynamics.

0,Bioaugmentation with Vaults: Novel In Situ Remediation Strategy for Transformation of PFAS,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shaily Mahendra,"While many physico-chemical approaches are available for degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), such as adsorption, photooxidation, and sonochemical pyrolysis, these options tend to be energy- and cost-intensive, which are impractical and expensive to be implemented in situ for the remediation of chemicals of concern. Other treatment methods, such as activated carbon adsorption and ion exchange resins, do not ensure detoxification of PFAS. While biological treatment using microbial whole cells is promising, it is constrained by geochemical characteristics and by concerns of biofouling, potentially releasing pathogens, and affecting microbial ecology of the natural and engineered systems. Using their extracellular enzymes directly was a promising alternative approach, because in vitro enzymes tend to be more efficient, and less constrained by the requirements for microbial growth. The limited stability of free enzymes in natural environments, however, restricts their implementation.Phase I of this study proposed to develop an innovative in situ bioremediation technology using vault nanoparticles packaged with biodegradative enzymes that will facilitate the degradation of PFAS, and potentially other water chemicals of concern. It was hypothesized that packaging active enzymes into vault nanoparticles for remediation of PFAS will eliminate the reliance on fungal growth and repeated injections of purified enzymes by enhancing in situ stability of multiple enzymes simultaneously. The study aimed to develop a single-step method for encapsulating ligninolytic enzymes (lignin peroxidase [LiP], manganese peroxidase [MnP], and laccase enzymes) in recombinant vaults. Phase I is complete and initial studies successfully confirmed that packaging fungal ligninolytic enzymes in vaults increased their stability as well as biotransformation rates of phenol, triclosan and BPA. Studies also successfully demonstrated packaging of MnP and LiP into vaults. However, due to limited enzyme concentration and incubation time, the results for PFAS transformation were not as significant. The results of Phase I studies can be found in the .In Phase II, the focus will be on the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). Key objectives are to (1) Continue testing biotransformation of PFOA and 6:2 FTOH by MnP packaged in vaults; (2) To package laccase in vaults and compare the activity of the vault-packaged enzyme with the natural enzymes; and (3) To test the biotransformation of PFOA and 6:2 FTOH by vault-packaged laccase. The ultimate goal is to provide an innovative in situ remediation technology for biodegradation of select PFAS using ligninolytic enzymes, enhanced and protected by packaging in vault nanoparticles, thus eliminating the dependence on live organisms for biodegradation of the chemicals of concern.less",2014,‐,
0,A Combined Photo/Electrochemical Reductive Pathway Towards Enhanced PFAS Degradation,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to David Jassby,"The goal of this project was to develop a combined photo/electrochemical reduction process capable of degrading recalcitrant per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), as well as other co-occurring chemicals found in investigation-derived waste generated during the study of groundwater. This process relies on electron transfer (ET) between negatively charged hydrophobic cathodes and sorbed hydrophobic chemicals, where the applied electrical potential is lower than the water splitting potential, followed by a reaction with a hydrated electron. ET between the electrode and the sorbed chemical lowers the activation energy of the carbon-fluorine bond, dramatically increasing the reaction rate. This process is an innovative modification of typical PFAS reductive defluorination methods, dramatically increasing PFAS degradation rates up to 30 times in a non-optimized system when compared to the control. This, in turn, will lead to lower overall energy consumption and shorter hydraulic retention times.less",2018,‐,
0,"Biodegradation of CVOCs and 1,4-Dioxane Mixtures by Engineered Microbial Communities",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shaily Mahendra,"The overarching objective of this proof-of-concept project was to understand and apply potential treatment synergies to ultimately achieve biodegradation of multiple contaminants in source zones as well as distal plumes. Specifically, a microbial community was formulated to simultaneously or sequentially degrade chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOC) and 1,4-dioxane across changing redox environments. Some CVOCs have used 1,4-dioxane as a solvent stabilizer; consequently, 1,4-dioxane is detected as a co-occurring contaminant with CVOCs at many sites. Anaerobic biological reduction is a common remediation approach for CVOCs in groundwater, such as trichloroethene (TCE). However, under some conditions, intermediate daughter products, such as -1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride, are accumulated, which may be more toxic than their parent compounds. Aerobic cometabolism of CVOCs requires additional amendments of primary substrates. 1,4-Dioxane is mainly biodegraded under aerobic conditions. The opposing redox conditions favored by CVOC- and 1,4-dioxane-degrading bacteria pose challenges for concurrent bioremediation of both contaminant classes. By combining anaerobic and aerobic microbes, CVOC transformation products are less likely to persist, and can even be biodegraded aerobically, thereby mitigating their inhibition of 1,4-dioxane-degrading bacteria.less",2017,‐,
0,"In Situ Biodegradation of 1,4-Dioxane: Effects of Metals and Chlorinated Solvent Co-Contaminants",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shaily Mahendra,"Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane has been successfully established in the laboratory; however, it is not often observed in contaminated environments. In addition to limitations caused by inadequate microbial communities, dissolved oxygen, and aquifer biogeochemistry, the inhibitory effects of co-contaminants might be responsible for hindering in situ 1,4-dioxane biodegradation. Equally importantly, many sites with 1,4-dioxane are currently or were previously treated for chlorinated compounds, thus resulting in the implementation of remedies that do not remove 1,4-dioxane, or may hinder 1,4-dioxane biodegradation. The objective of this project is to evaluate suspected limiting effects of co-contaminants and remedial technologies on 1,4-dioxane biodegradation.less",2013,‐,

However, with increasing effects of climate change being manifested, the project team is interested in re-assessing the risk of projects that are based on stationary intensity-duration-frequency curves to manage events such as extreme precipitation and flooding via runoff. The objectives of this project are to (1) develop protocols for incorporating non-stationarity into extreme value theory, which can be applied to flood frequency as well as extreme precipitation events; and incorporate ongoing and future projections of climate warming on flood frequency estimates for watersheds affected by (2) rain-on-snow events and (3) atmospheric rivers.less",2015,‐,
0,Leptospirosis in Endangered Island Foxes and California Sea Lions: Outbreak Prediction and Prevention in a Changing World,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to James Lloyd-Smith,"Leptospirosis, the disease caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus , is a major health burden for humans and animals worldwide and a recognized risk for military personnel. has circulated for decades in California sea lions (CSL) (), and an outbreak of a near-identical strain was recently discovered in endangered island foxes () on Santa Rosa Island (SRI), California. This raised concerns about risks to island fox subspecies on three nearby Department of Defense islands.This project studied the ecology of in these two species of concern, and built models to analyze how non-stationary conditions affect disease incidence and impacts. The objectives were: (1) to identify the source of the current outbreak on SRI, (2) to understand the drivers of dynamics in CSL and build a model to make short- and long-term predictions, and (3) to study the ecology of in island foxes and build a model to project its future impacts on SRI and assess management strategies under changing conditions.less",2016,‐,

0,A Systems Approach for the Assessment and Prediction of the Natural Attenuation Mechanisms of Contaminant Mixtures,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Shaily Mahendra,"Natural attenuation is a preferred remedy for many sites due to its low cost and limited environmental impacts and human interventions as compared to active remediation. 1,4-Dioxane, a carcinogenic solvent stabilizer, is a widespread groundwater contaminant associated with plumes of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOC). However, the physicochemical and biological processes that potentially lead to the natural attenuation of 1,4-dioxane are strongly impacted by microbial functions, geochemical factors (e.g., oxygen, temperature), and co-occurring CVOCs (e.g., 1,1-dichloroethane [DCA], and 1,2-DCA), especially under low 1,4-dioxane conditions. While several laboratory and field studies of 1,4-dioxane degradation by pure cultures and consortia are reported, a microbiome-based framework to quantitatively evaluate and predict natural attenuation of 1,4-dioxane in complex systems has not yet been adequately developed.Under this study, multiple omics technologies, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, will be applied as well as stable isotope probing (SIP), in natural and engineered experimental systems, to comprehensively characterize indigenous microbiomes, mechanisms, and kinetics specifically responsible for low concentration 1,4-dioxane biodegradation in the presence of CVOC. With the collective microbial information from taxonomic and functional aspects, as well as hydrological and geochemical parameters, machine learning will be used to produce a rational interactive microbiome-contaminant-geochemistry model to predict contaminant fate and transport by microbial features as well as assess the overall ecological status of contaminated sites.

0,Passive-Active Modular Stormwater Biofilter Designs to Enhance PFAS Removal in Variable Flow Conditions,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Sanjay Mohanty,"Treatment of impacted stormwater at its source is considered as a viable strategy to prevent downstream impacted surface waters and sediments; however, the utility of stormwater treatment systems such as biofilters is often limited due to a low per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) removal capacity of filter media used in stormwater treatment systems. Moreover, biofilter media get exhausted quickly during high flow conditions and in the presence of high concentrations of suspended particles and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) typically present in stormwater. The conventional passive design of biofilters is not adequate to remove PFAS under these conditions.This project aims to develop passive-active modular stormwater treatment units that can consistently remove PFAS at varying flows and complex stormwater mixtures. The modular units will utilize two in situ methods to alter the surface charge of filter media and dramatically increase their capacity to ionic and short-chain PFAS that are typically most difficult to remove. Both methods include application of either direct current at low potential (1.5 volts) through granular activated carbon (GAC) or cationic polymer such as polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDDA) on any conventional biofilters installed in DoD sites.

0,Emergent Nontrivial Phenomena in Quantum Heterostructures and Their Applications in Electronics,United States Department of the Army,to Kang Wang,"Interplay between spin-polarized current and magnetization has led to many core phenomena and applications in spintronics. On the one hand, the spin-polarized current, generated by filtering through a ferromagnet (FM) or by spin Hall effect (SHE) in heavy metals and/or surface spin- momentum locking in topological insulators (TIs), can provide efficient means for manipulation of magnetization orientation through the spin angular momentum transfer. On the other hand, the magnetization can also significantly influence the electrical transport of spin-polarized current in these structures. The most well-known is the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in the stacked FM layers with magnetization parallel or antiparallel to each other, which has played a major role in all modern developments of spintronics. Another nontrivial magnetoresistance (MR), the so-called spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in heavy metal/magnet bilayers, arises due to the back flow of spin- polarized current into the heavy metal when the SHE-induced spin accumulation at the interface is collinear with the orientation of the magnetic layer, which reduces the resistance of the heavy metal layer due to the inverse SHE. Recently, another intriguing unidirectional spin-dependent magnetoresistance (USMR) has been identified in the bilayers composed of high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) material and magnet, such as the heavy metal/FM and the Ga1-xMnxAs structures. The USMR depends on the relative orientation of the current-induced spin accumulation at the interface and the magnetization direction of the magnetic layer, parallel or antiparallel, in which the MR of the bilayer is different. The USMR could be understood from the current-in- plane GMR model or the spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced electron-magnon interactions. Both the SMR and USMR have potential applications in the sensing technology to detect the magnetization orientation in high-SOC material/magnet bilayers. Compared with heavy metals and semiconductors with high SOC, TIs exhibit much stronger SOC and inverted band structure in the bulk. Most importantly, TIs possess the unique spin-momentum locked Dirac fermions on the surface, which are expected to be more efficient for generating spin polarization/accumulation at the interface, and hence are more efficient for producing the USMR when coupled with magnetic materials. To further explore the USMR in TI-based structures for potential technological application, it is crucial to investigate whether the surface states or the bulk carriers contribute most to the USMR effect, and also systematically study the correlation between the USMR strength and the magnetism in the structure.less",2015,‐,
0,Piezoelectric Pump Utilizing Innovative Non-Mechanical Active Valves,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Conal O'Neill,"The objective of this program is to develop and make ready for commercial production a novel pump design utilizing piezoelectric pumping elements combined with fast acting non mechanical active valves and a miniature digital controller. The piezoelectricactuator is an available building block that has a proven track record, surviving 3x109 cycles in diesel fuel injectors. Available conventional valve technology has thus far prevented full exploitation of the piezoelectric actuator's capabilities for usein pumps. A fast acting valve is needed. Functionality of the novel valve proposed here as well as a prototype of the compact pump, have already been demonstrated in Phase I of this program. The combination of piezoelectric actuator and non-mechanicalvalves has the potential to result in the first high frequency and thus high power density and intrinsically reliable piezoelectric pump with no wear components. It is proposed under Phase II of this program to develop and fabricate a pump suitable forcommercial sale, and develop analytical tools to enable optimization of pump design parameters to easy adjustment of the design to meet a wide range of applications. It is anticipated that the result of this Phase II effort will be a compact hydraulic pumpthat has higher specific power density than any currently available that can meet the requirements for many aerospace as well as general industrial requirements.
