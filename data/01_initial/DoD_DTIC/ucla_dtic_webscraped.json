        "abstract": "Semiconductor spin qubits have satisfied the DiVincenzo criteria for scalable quantum computing. Several research groups have recently demonstrated high-fidelity spin state initialization, readout, single-qubit and two-qubit control. This research program is focused on demonstrating fast control and readout of spin qubit arrays, as well as developing a modular spin qubit architecture, wherein two spatially separated two-qubit modules are coherently coupled through a quantum interconnect. Several promising approaches exist for long-range coupling of spin qubits, including exchange coupling through large intermediary quantum dots, circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), and the physical transfer of spin-based quantum information through charge shuttling. We will demonstrate coherent coupling of two or more two-qubit modules using spin shuttling. In parallel, the theory team will estimate the fidelity of various spin transfer protocols that are based on cQED. The theory team will also develop quantum characterization verification and validation (QCVV) protocols that can be applied to characterize the overall fidelity of our modular spin qubit architecture. In the area of quantum control and readout, the research team has two major objectives. The first is to build upon recent gains in single- and two-qubit control fidelities through fundamental investigations of the fidelity-limiting mechanisms. Current bottlenecks are limitations in the maximum Rabi frequency that can be achieved with electric dipole spin resonance, crosstalk during single qubit control due to microwave cross-coupling and residual exchange, limited dynamic range of the exchange coupling, and slow gate calibration times. A second objective is to develop cutting-edge quantum control and readout protocols that have the potential to greatly reduce the required qubit drive times and powers, significantly reduce the readout time, and enable multiplexed readout of spin qubit arrays. The team will focus on implementations involving Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, where quantum information is encoded in the spin of a single electron. LD qubits are generally controlled using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) in a magnetic field gradient and coherently coupled using the exchange interaction. While impressive progress has been made in controlling LD qubits with high fidelity, most demonstrations involve just single or two-qubit devices. Our team has been at the forefront of efforts to develop scalable semiconductor quantum devices, including pioneering demonstrations of resonant two-qubit gates, as well as spin coupling and readout using cQED.less",

Technical Approach We take a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates four areas illustrated by the four layers: (a) Psychology and cognitive experiments; (b) knowledge representation; (c) lifelong learning; and (d) computer vision tasks in an inference engine. The four areas will be studied in tight loops shown by the arrows in 3 colors. Human experiments bring new paradigms to transform computer vision and machine learning; and the latter drive human experiments to probe the brain mechanisms for representation, inference and learning. Each area consists of a spectrum of tasks which we organize in three levels of increasing depth and complexity: (i) Categorical recognition; (ii) joint parsing; (iii) Cognitive reasoning. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team from both the US and UK to achieve our goals, including: Experimental psychology and cognition, computer vision and learning, Cognitive and mathematical modeling. Outcome and Impact Our proposed research tackles challenges of pressing importance in the following DoD missions. 1) Persistent surveillance with ground and aerial sensors. Our approach will achieve deep understanding, generate narrative text descriptions, and answer human queries. 2) Web scale commonsense knowledge acquisition and information gathering. We will expand our lifelong learning engine to discover visual and common sense knowledge from heterogeneous sources on the web, organize them into deep structured knowledge on a unified graphical representation. This will fill the semantic gaps, overcome the shortcomings of machine learning approaches. 3) Robot autonomy and situation awareness. We will develop task-oriented representations and learning, so that machines understand the underlying physics, causal-effects, functionality of objects, the use of tools, and human intents, needs and values. This will improve robot autonomy in civil and military tasks in collaboration with humans.less",

        "abstract": "Mammals are comprised of trillions of microorganisms, together called the microbiome, that respond to environmental factors, such as diet and stress, and have the remarkable capacity to modulate host brain activity and behavior. Despite increasing evidence that the gut microbiome influences brain development and function, the molecular mechanisms that enable microbiota-gut-brain interactions remain unclear. Fundamental principles are lacking for how complex microbial communities develop and respond to external stimuli, and unified models are needed to map the dynamic microbial, enteric, metabolic, immune and neural signaling networks that comprise the microbiota-gut-brain axis. To address this need, we will investigate how the gut microbiome alters cognitive sensorimotor and spatial learning behavior in response to variations in dietary fat: carbohydrate intake and exposure to oxygen deprivation stress. Technical Approaches. We will conduct controlled gnotobiotic and microfluidic experiments to determine how the microbiome is altered as a function of fat: carbohydrate intake and physical hypoxic stress and to uncover how these microbiome changes causally impact host physiology. These experimental data will be used to develop a multilayered mathematical model of the microbiome-gut-brain axis that examines system architecture, performance, sensitivity and robustness. Altogether, the proposed project integrates advances in functional genomics, microfluidics, gnotobiotics, metabolic modeling, optogenetics, and control theory. Anticipated Outcome: Through iterative in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiments, with cross-referenced testing of predictions across experimental systems, we will extract fundamental biological insights for i) how nutrition and physical stress modify microbial community structure and function, ii) how microbial products biotransformed through the gastrointestinal tract modulate metabolic, immune and vagal signaling, and iii) how metabolic, immune and vagal activity determine cognitive performance. Impact on DoD Capabilities: The mathematical models we develop would enable predictions of microbiome, immune, metabolic, vagal and behavioral responses based on quantitative inputs of dietary fat vs. carbohydrate intake and physical stress (oxygen) levels.

As programmers continue to develop layers of useful libraries, the security and efficiency of application software decreas\"e. The problem is that the massive libraries usually add complexity to even simple tasks and increase attack surfaces.Objective: Th\"e goal of our project is to show how we can address the security and inefficiency problems with novel, automatic software tools. Our\"\" tools will remove little used functionality, decrease run-time bloat, and specialize libraries to what is actually used. A unique s\"\"trength of our project is that we will actively leverage the synergy between the three research thrusts on functionality reduction,\"\" de-bloating, and de-layering.Approach:On functionality reduction (FR), our goal is to select features and code regions to be remo\"ved from applications and underlying libraries. In order not to require any kinds of human effort in tagging features or functionali\"ty, we propose a completely automated approach to detect (1) unused functionality by finding never-invoked APIs or discovering defac\"\"touse of the interfaces, (2) inefficient objects by determining which faster performing type could replace a slower performing type\"\", and (3) redundant program logic evidenced by code duplication in binaries. On de-bloating (DB), our goal is to permanently and sta\"tically remove the unnecessary features and code regions. We propose a set of static techniques that merge functionalities of related types with the goal of removing unnecessary types and propose an automated clone removal technique that factorizes redundant code\" in bytecode. On de-layering (DL), our goal is toreduce indirections and layers of abstractions through static inlining and partial\"\" evaluation. Our specializationtechnique will remove redundant features, partially evaluate generic code, and change allocation sit\"es to use the fastest-performing type. The proposed work builds on the PIs~ foundational work on runtime bloat detection and removal\", code clone analysis and removal, and type-safe inlining. We see tremendous potential for the synergy across the above three resear\"ch thrusts. We will design a synergistic approach where the results of one thrust are actively fedto the other two thrusts. As a re\"sult, we will produce a single, completely automated, integrated, end-user friendly infrastructure that combines the three thrusts.\"\"Mission/Relevance: As software development has evolved, additional layers of abstraction have been continually added resulting in in\"creased complexity and inefficiencies. The research integrates well with an important thrust within ONR~s cyber research program to perform late-stage software transformation to de-bloat and de-layer the exceedingly complex modern software. This research will contribute to ONR~s vision of building a transformative ecosystem for bloat-free software with reduced attack surfaces.less",

The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, Summit, may have a computing capacity comparable to that of the human brain. However, Summit consumes the equivalent power of 7000 homes (~15 MW), and the brain only consumes a power of a light bulb (~20 W). Computers execute algorithms on physically separated logic and memory units in digital serial mode, which fundamentally restrains computers from handling \u201cbig data\u201d efficiently in complex dynamic environments, and limits the developments of emerging intelligent systems such as self piloted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By contrast, the brain simultaneously processes and learns from \u201cbig data\u201d via trillions of synapses and neurons in analog parallel mode, and facilitates parallel processing and real time learning with an energy efficiency more than five orders of magnitude superior to that of the supercomputer. The proposed study intends to perform research on devices including synaptic resistors (synstors), memory resistors (memristors), and neuristors to emulate the analog short and long term memory, convolutional signal processing, and correlative learning functions of synapses, and the nonlinear dynamic functions of neurons.less",

Recognizing and troubleshooting problems on board ship is a crucial skill for technicians, and is essential for a ship\u2019s viability and the safety of its crew. Much of the knowledge and skills required of engineering technicians is to effectively utilize situational and diagnostic cues from the engineering plant to determine potential or actual problems early on, and address them in time before they can escalate to costly and/or dangerous levels. Training to be proficient in such skills requires more than just content understanding and system knowledge, but also necessitates being able to blend this knowledge in hands-on, realworld contexts. A virtualized training environment in which key systems of a ship can be replicated in authentic ways, and in which a student is enabled to interact both physically and cognitively with the system, affords great benefits for training and assessing for engineering related skills/ratings. In such an environment, the student would practice tasks and decisionmaking in authentic, simulated contexts, and be able to use his or her senses to detect abnormal conditions such as excessive heat, unusual sounds, or odors emanating from certain pieces of equipment \u2013 all of which could be indicators of problems that can be triaged appropriately and addressed. The National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) proposes to develop an engineering-skills virtual reality test bed. It will combine interface technologies to support advanced sensing modalities (including motion and gesture recognition), advanced feedback modalities (including tactile and olfactory feedback), advanced adaptive training technology, and automated performance assessment capabilities. This proposal outlines the research that we will conduct to examine the effects of multisensory stimuli in an instructional/training setting on learning and performance. This will include looking at adapting task complexity both within and between scenarios, and other supplemental training modules, including perceptual learning modules, and modules on selfmonitoring and creative thinking that focus on troubleshooting.less",

Currently, aircraft avoid operating in such extreme aerodynamic scen,arios, leaving a void in the operational capability. This is due to the fact that traditional aerodynamics are largely based on lin,ear analysis about a steady operating condition with nonlinear extensions for modest levels of perturbations. Understanding flight,in extreme aerodynamic environments calls for innovative perspectives to analyze, model, predict, and control extreme levels of unst,eadiness over lifting bodies. Recent advancements in computational hardware and data-science libraries present a unique opportunity, to develop next-generation aircraft achieving air dominance in extreme weather.Objectives: The ultimate objective here is to establ,ish a novel framework to detect the approach of unknown large-scale perturbations in the atmosphere, determine how such disturbances, affect the dynamics of the aircraft, and perform flow control or maneuvers to achieve stable flight. One of the major challenges i,s that turbulent disturbances in the atmosphere take various forms affecting the vehicle performance in strongly nonlinear manners., If these disturbance dynamics are naively considered, the investigation would require an astronomical number of parametric studies., For these reasons, the study of extreme aerodynamics requires a shift in our scientific perspective from traditional aerodynamics t,o an innovative approach to extracting the dominant extreme response of flying bodies from a massive collection of data. To achieve, the goals of this proposal, we will utilize ultramodern concepts in dynamical systems, network science, and data science. In the p,resent effort, we will (1) numerically simulate extreme aerodynamic model flows with large potential, vortical, and turbulent distur,bances for 2D and 3D wings as well as a tailless UAV model; (2) reveal the universal extreme aerodynamic features through manifold i,dentification using machine learning; (3) model extreme aerodynamics using cluster network analysis and identify key vortical featu,res responsible for transient force generation; (4) assess control effectors for extreme aerodynamic conditions and develop control,techniques based on generalized phased-based and model predictive control; (5) train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in,an interdisciplinary manner to be leading experts in extreme aerodynamics; and (6) disseminate findings through publications, confer,ences presentations, and workshop organizations to form a research community in the field of extreme aerodynamics.Impact on DoD Capa,bilities: A focused research investment for this orchestrated work will establish the theoretical and computational framework for a,new field of extreme aerodynamics and support the designs and operations of next-generation air vehicles in adverse atmospheric cond,itions. The novel approaches developed from this effort can also be extended to highly unsteady marine environments.less",

        "abstract": "Battery electrode materials are based traditionally on cationic redox processes with 3d transition metals being the most widely investigated. The anions that make up the rest of the material have generally been considered inactive and do not contribute to energystorage. Thus, utilizing redox processes of anions can lead to a potentially large increase in Li-ion battery capacity and energy density, helping to guide the development of next generation Li-ion battery materials. The overarching objective of the research isto use amorphous transition metal sulfides as the basis for obtaining electrode materials which exhibit both cationic and anionic redox. As our initial studies show, amorphous materials benefit from facile bond stretching and overall structural flexibility whichcan be traced to the greater free volume of an amorphous environment. The open architecture of the amorphous system enables the metal-ion coordination to change, which is likely to be a critical feature for the S-S bond breaking and formation processes which are involved in charge storage. To realize this goal, the research will address several fundamental questions regarding amorphous transition metal sulfides. This includes the role of covalency in achieving anion redox, the importance of short-range order in influencing redox reactions and Li-ion diffusion, and identifying compositions which exhibit the highest levels of anion redox. Another objective is to better understand the reasons that amorphous and crystalline transition metal sulfides with the same nominal composition exhibit different redox properties. The proposed research on amorphous transition metal sulfides is intended to be a coordinated program which combines synthesis, electrochemical characterization, synchrotron XAS and computational simulations. By having a critical mass of individual investigators with complementary strengths, we will be able to obtain fundamental understanding of amorphous transition metal sulfides and assess their ability to achieve significantly greater energy density through the combination of anion and cation redox processes. We expect the outcome of this project to not only provide a detailed understanding of anionic redox but also to identify compositions and charge storage mechanisms which lead to high performance battery materials. The potential impact ofthis research on the DoD is that it is directed at identifying new electrochemical materials aimed at improving lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery performance.Approved for Public Releaseless",

The state of the art in modeling RF magnetic components is significantly lagging components consisting only electric material with most commercial software being limited to modeling simple, linear material behaviors which are not representative of material response in actual hardware. Moreover, the intrinsic material properties are critically important such as the excitation of the internal spin waves through the exchange of the magnetic domains. These are important mechanisms contributing to power-dependent insertion loss and frequency-selective limitation observed in FSL and SNE. Modeling of such effects in a comprehensive way requires unifying of governing physics from material level in nanometer scales to component level in centimeter scales, where rigorous modeling of such physics spanning six orders of magnitude is impossible even with the fastest supercomputer in the world. In this project, UCLA and UMN researchers team up to attack this grand challenge through development of a multi-physics, multi-scale time-domain solver that can model the seven orders of magnitudes scale difference from nanometers to centimeters, including the physics from electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves to the nonlinear generation of dipole-exchange spin waves into one unified framework. The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to provide a comprehensive and precise modeling solution for nonlinear magnetics. Furthermore, the program focuses on providing a design kit that is physically solid, computationally efficient, and conveniently implementable to commercial simulation software such as ADS. This later is achieved through innovative interpretations of the motions of magnetic spins and their mutual coupling, as well as comprehensive and accurate mathematical representations of the underlying physics. A compact model will be delivered as the outcome of this project that is capable of predicting the performances of magnetic components using equivalent circuits. This model for the first time enables designers to develop circuit architectures that will optimize FSL and SNE performance, and enables system designers to determine the impact of these devices would have on the overall system. Moreover, the model translates the complex magnetic behaviors into equivalent electrical behaviors, which facilitates the understanding of micro-magnetics and allows invention of novel magnetic devices.less",

The soft arms composed of force-sensitive hydrogel ~muscles~ with an embedded silver ~neuron~ network can adaptively interact with local environment by local sensing and continuous deformation. The dynamic control via built-in local sensing-actuation feedback loop enablesadaptive reconfiguration to perform high-level tasks - grasping, twisting and propulsion without central control.We propose to create a framework for rapid prototyping and control of robust, energyefficient, autonomous soft tentacles with distributed neuromuscular-inspired sensing and actuation. The tentacles will be capable of continuous deformation through the use of hydrogel~muscles~ and distributed sensing through the use of embedded silver ~neuron~ interconnections. Such a unique octopus-inspired design avoids multiplexed electronic units and high energy input. In addition, the proposed design forms a built-in local ~sensing-actuation~ feedback loop to achieve adaptive reconfiguration and perform high-level tasks such as locomotion and reversible adhesion without direct control from a central nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team consists of a biologist with specialization in functional anatomy (Fisher), a material scientist with specialization in stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-material 3D printing (He), a bio-inspired roboticist (Marvi), a specialist in design and rapid prototyping (Aukes), a specialist in the dynamics and scalable control of bio-inspired robotic swarms (Berman), and a specialist in control of PDEs and infinite-dimensional systems (Peet). To achieve the proposed outcome, our team will execute the following proposed tasks: Biology (Aim 1) We will characterize theneuromuscular structure of octopus tentacles and investigate the roles of distributed sensing, dynamics, and control in their adaptive control-based motions; Material Science (Aim 2) We will fabricate hybrid polymer-based flexible structures using stimuli-responsive hydrogel ~muscles~ with embedded metallic ~neurons~ via a novel additive-manufacturing,stereolithographic 3D-printing technique, which can print both polymeric and metallic materials into highly complex architectures at resolution of up to 3 ~m; Distributed Sensing, Dynamics, and Control (Aims 3-4) We will develop a PDE-based control-theoretic representation of tentacle motion and environmental interaction which is inherently infinite-dimensional and isbased on anatomical studies of octopus tentacles. We will design scalable, consensus-based localfeedback strategies for autonomous performance of high-level tasks such as locomotion in unstructured environments and optimal switchable adhesion. Design Integration (Aim 5) We will design a robust framework for integration of multiple tentacles with a central mantle for high-level communication of commands. We will conduct computational simulations to optimize the system integration. We will also investigate the ways in which material and geometric design considerations of this hybrid material influence the actuation and control capabilities of a design. This work will provide the foundations for soft robotic applications that require safe operation close to humans and resilience to contact with obstacles or falls, as well as improved, compliantsensing surfaces for grasping, manipulation, propulsion, and prosthetics applications.less",

        "abstract": "Overview and problem statement: This project will create a new comprehensive research field of one-dimensional (1D) quantum materials consisting of individual atomic chains and few-chain threads of van-der-Waals (vdW) materials, and composites comprised of bulk polymer matrix with 1D atomic chain fillers. Thereby, it will shift the current paradigm by taking one step down in dimensionality from 2D vdW materials and creating truly 1D quantum materials. The proposed research focuses on unfettered, beyond-conventional approaches to the discovery of materials that exhibit previously unattainable functionalities. Limited experimental work is available onlyfor bundles of atomic chains of such 1D vdW materials, suggesting extraordinary electrical current densities and unusual electron-phonon coupling. Computational machine learning studies indicate that there are hundreds of vdW materials with true-1D or quasi-1D crystalline structures consisting of 1D atomic threads weakly bound in bundles. Exfoliated to a few-chain atomic thread, these materials become genuinely quantum: owing to their atomic scale dimensions and atomically sharp interfaces, the electron states are quantumconfined; in addition, many quasi-1D vdW materials are strongly-correlated quantum systems, which reveal non-trivial quantum phenomena, such as charge-density-wave (CDW) condensate phases, magnetic phases, superconductivity, strong spin-orbit coupling, and non-trivial topology. Project goals and objectives: We propose to perform a comprehensive study of 1D quantum materials with the goals of understanding the limits of downscaling of 1D vdW crystals; fine-tuning electron and phonon transport, quasi-particle interactions; and controlling strongly-correlated quantum phenomena in 1D materials. We anticipate discoveries of unique electronic, thermal, and optical properties of 1D quantum materials, resulting from the ultimate quantum confinement of elemental excitations and collective quantum states. We will apply perspectives from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering to provide high-payoff research results. Project objectives include: 1) exfoliating 1D vdW materials down to the ultimate single-atomic chain limit; 2) determining the electrical, thermal, magnetic, and optical characteristics of 1D materials; 3) establishing the electrical control of these characteristics; and 4) understanding and engineering the properties of quantum composites comprised of the polymer matrix and 1D vdWfillers. Innovative technical approaches include nanofabrication of capped and suspended 1D vdW devices to study single quantum phase-slip events; electronic \"noise spectroscopy\" for monitoring CDW and magnetic phase transitions; Brillouin-Mandelstam-Raman spectroscopy of confined elemental excitations; polarization photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons; thermal measurements of heat conduction properties; and electromagnetic testing of dielectric constants of composites with 1D vdWfillers. The experimental research will be supported by the world-class ab-initio theory. Anticipated project outcomes and impact on DoD capabilities: The long-term outcomes of this project will create a foundation for the new class of 1D quantum materials and composites based on such materials withnumerous potential applications to DoD scientific priorities and operational needs. The proposed 1D vdW quantum materials will leadto revolutionary innovations in electronics, sensors, and energy conversion, areas that are of importance to DoD. These materials will impact the DoD capabilities in low-power memory and logic, nanoelectronics, antenna design, and communications, as well as energy conversion and thermal management. Additionally, this project will educate and train researchers for the defense workforce at a highly-ranked research-intensive institution with unique experimental facilities.less",

        "abstract": "Non-von Neumann computing systems, especially the so-called brain-inspired systems (also called cognitive and neuromorphic systems), have potential to be game changing in computing capability per unit power. The underlying technologies of computer chips have advanced to the point that functional neuromorphic architectures of increasing complexity are being reported; continuing evolution of technologies is expected to expand the practicality and functional levels of neuromorphic architectures. Such computational capability at very low power levels has tremendous potential benefit for DoD applications. A great deal is known about the response of semiconductor technologies (esp. silicon-based) to radiation; somewhat less so for emerging technologies (non-silicon, 2D materials, non-charge based memories, etc.), but in many cases is the subject of ongoing research. However, very little is known about the impact of radiation environments on the robustness of neuromorphic circuit architectures implemented in advanced technologies. This multi-disciplinary project will bring together researchers with expertise in non-conventional computer architecture, device engineering, novel circuit design and radiation effects, and leverage unique access to hardware and simulation capabilities, to advance the understanding of the radiation science of this computing paradigm. Moving forward, novel hardware/circuit specifically designed and optimized for neuromorphic computing are required to unlock the ultra-low power and massively parallel processing power of such brain-inspired systems. Among the many options, novel non-volatile mutlilevel memory elements are essential for the construct of artificial synapses. A novel charge trapped transistors (CTT) and the associated artificial synapse circuit are currently being developed at UCLA in collaboration with GlobalFoundries. In this program, we will examine the radiation effects on these CTT and quantitatively examine the effects of radiation on the neuromorphic computing architecture realized using these novel memory elements.less",
