        "abstract": "Overview and problem statement: This project will create a new comprehensive research field of one-dimensional (1D) quantum materials consisting of individual atomic chains and few-chain threads of van-der-Waals (vdW) materials, and composites comprised of bulk polymer matrix with 1D atomic chain fillers. Thereby, it will shift the current paradigm by taking one step down in dimensionality from 2D vdW materials, and creating truly 1D quantum materials. The proposed research focuses on unfettered, beyond-conventional approaches to the discovery of materials that exhibit previously unattainable functionalities. Limited experimental work is available only for bundles of atomic chains of such 1D vdW materials, suggesting extraordinary electrical current densities and unusual electron-phonon coupling. Computational machine learning studies indicate that there are hundreds of vdW materials with true-1D or quasi-1D crystalline structures consisting of 1D atomic threads weakly bound in bundles. Exfoliated to a few-chain atomic threads, these materials become genuinely quantum: owing to their atomic scale dimensions and atomically sharp interfaces, the electron states are quantum confined; in addition, many of 1D vdW materials are strongly-correlated quantum systems, which reveal non-trivial quantum phenomena, such as charge-density-wave (CDW) condensate phases, magnetic phases, superconductivity, strong spin orbit coupling, and non-trivial topology. Project goals and objectives: We propose to perform a comprehensive study of 1D quantum materials with the goals of understanding the limits of downscaling of 1D vdW crystals; fine tuning electron and phonon transport, quasi-particle interactions; and controlling strongly correlated quantum phenomena in 1D materials. We anticipate discoveries of unique electronic, thermal, and optical properties of 1D quantum materials, resulting from the ultimate quantum confinement of elemental excitations and collective quantum states. We will apply perspectives from physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering to provide high-payoff research results. Project objectives include: 1) exfoliating 1D vdW materials down to the ultimate single-atomic chain limit; 2) determining the electrical, thermal, magnetic, and optical characteristics of 1D materials; 3) establishing the electrical control of these characteristics; and 4) understanding and engineering the properties of quantum composites comprised of the polymer matrix and 1D vdW fillers. Innovative technical approaches include nanofabrication of capped and suspended 1D vdW devices to study single quantum phase-slip events; electronic \u201cnoise spectroscopy\u201d for monitoring CDW and magnetic phase transitions; Brillouin-Mandelstam-Raman spectroscopy of confined elemental excitations; polarization photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons; thermal bridge measurements of heat conduction properties; and electromagnetic testing of dielectric constants of composites with 1D vdW fillers. The experimental research will be supported by the world-class ab-initio theory. Anticipated project outcomes and impact on DoD capabilities: The long-term outcomes of this project will create a foundation for the new class of 1D quantum materials and composites based on such materials with numerous potential applications to DoD scientific priorities and operational needs. The proposed 1D vdW quantum materials will lead to revolutionary innovations in the electronics, sensors, and energy conversion, areas which are of importance to DoD. These materials will impact the DoD capabilities in low-power memory and logic, nanoelectronics, antenna design and communications, as well as energy conversion and thermal management. Additionally, this project will educate and train researchers for the defense workforce at a University with a rare combination of being an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution and a highly ranked research-intensive institless",

The overall objective is to mechanistically characterize the most efficient and bond-selective selective approaches for driving chemical conversion processes at metal nanoparticle surfaces through non-thermal excitation mechanisms. A few common metal nanostructures (Ag, Pt, Ru nanoparticles) and extensively studied chemical systems (NO, CO, N2, CH4, and CH3OH desorption and dissociation) will be studied under non-thermal excitation conditions - using photon or electron excitation - or their combination (using a non-thermal low-temperature plasma excitation). There is a mounting body of scientific evidence suggesting that such mechanisms can provide improvements with respect to both yield and reaction selectivity for catalytic reactions on nanostructured metal surfaces, but further developments will only be accessible once a fundamental understanding of chemical reaction induced by non-thermal excitation of metal nanostructures is reached. Carefully designed experiments will be conducted to investigate the reactivity of metal nanostructures under photon irradiation and e-beam exposure. A non-thermal plasma reactor will be used to investigate their reactivity under the more complex scenario in which multiple non-thermal excitation processes are simultaneously occurring. Finally, a combination of ab-initio, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, and time-dependent density functional theory calculations to complement experiments will be used to gain a fundamental, theoretical understanding of the processes under investigation. By correlating these findings with theoretical analysis of the non-thermal chemical processes, we expected to develop henomenological insights into properties of molecules, metals, and excitation sources that are critical for enabling bond selective chemistry in non-thermal processes on metal nanostructure surfaces.less",

These distributed systems have achieved great levels of autonomy, which guarantee success under nominal operating conditions in different time critical missions. Unfortunately, despite recent efforts to characterize attack vectors and countermeasures, research studies and real world incidents have demonstrated how capable adversaries can severely disrupt the operation of dynamic networks, thereby questioning their resiliency to operate in uncertain and adversarial environments. Novel theories and tools are critically needed to guarantee resiliency of dynamic networks, where both the network protocols and the attack strategy adapt over time as in an intricate game. In this project we characterize vulnerabilities of dynamic networks to attackers with different capabilities, knowledge, and objectives, and design rigorous methods to protect dynamic networks and adapt them to ensure resiliency to attacks. In particular, the PIs will (i) characterize fundamental resiliency limitations of networks against partially informed attackers, (ii) design topology adaptation algorithms to enhance resiliency of dynamic networks, and (iii) design strategies for the network operator to detect and adapt to adversaries. This project will undertake a rigorous approach based on dynamics, control, graph, and game theories, and will validate the findings through simulations and experiments with state of the art facilities. In addition to allowing the deployment of reliable networks and distributed systems in hostile environments, the theories and methods developed in this project will have far reaching implications and applicability across science and engineering, including medical, automotive, and energy sectors, as already demonstrated by the PIs' work.less",

This will be achieved through two broad research objectives: A) learning multi-agent, multi-modal data association models with limited supervision, and B) reliable decision-making in collaborative, decentralized teams. We will build upon existing low-level feature extraction and classification methods, and focus onthe high-level machine learning and decision making processes. Obj. A will be achieved through three tasks. First, we will show how data association modelsbetween multiple visual sensors can be learned with a small fraction of the labeling cost in current methods by taking into account the global characteristics of the multi-agent network (A1). Associations across modalities can also be learned with limited supervision by leveraging upon side information, possibly from the web; the challenge is to identify the most relevant side information (A2). The models need to be updated over time based on their performance. Information-theoretic methods for selecting the most informative samples will be used for model update, and sparse and low-rank structures inherent in the data will be exploited (A3). Obj. B will build upon the models learned in Obj. A to identify the portions most relevant to a task considering the correlations in the information between various sensors and modalities (B1). B2 will focus on identifying adversarial attacks on the data, first with known dynamical models offeature evolution to set performance bounds, followed by the more practical situation where models are only partially known. B3 closes the loop between perception and planning by acquiring the data that maximizes performance of the analysis modules. The proposed research builds upon recent advances in computer vision, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, and controls. The team of PIs reflects this blend of expertise. All the tasks will involve solid theoretical analysis and algorithm development focusing on optimizationstrategies, computational complexity, and performance bounds, and will be complemented with a rigorous evaluation phase for individual tasks, as well as their integration. Our existing facilities, along with equipment purchased through two new DURIP grants, will enable the experimental evaluation. The results will be presented in top-tier international conferences and journals, as well as in reports and presentations to the sponsor. The project directly addresses the need for understanding an environment from large volumes of heterogeneous streaming data collected by a team of autonomous agents. This has important Naval applications in field operations ranging from national security to disaster response. Our proposed methods will enable continuous and efficient learning of models that represent the data across sensors and modalities without the need for strong supervision, making decisions about the most task-relevant portions of the data along with detection of any adversarial attacks, and collaborative planning to acquire additional data to maximize the decision making accuracy. Overall, the project addresses some of the fundamental limitations of current autonomous systems by requiring only limited supervision, having the ability to identify relevant and reliable portions of large data volumes, and integrating the analysis and acquisition phasesless",

        "abstract": "Photosynthesis is remarkable, achieving nearly perfect light harvesting efficiency in spite of dynamic light conditions, rapidly fluctuating molecular structure, and highly intricate energy transfer pathways. Yet, it remains unknown whether there exists a fundamental organizing principle that gives rise to robust photosynthetic light harvesting. Here, we predict that light harvesting antennae can be finely tuned to maximize power conversion efficiency by passively minimizing excitation noise, thus providing a unified theoretical basis for the experimentally observed wavelength dependence of light absorption in green plants, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria. The research objectives of this proposal are two-fold: First, we propose to fabricate and characterize a novel microscope capable of measuring growth dynamics of light harvesting bacteria at the single cell limit. Second, by combining strong synergy between experiment and theory, we will use this microscope to achieve our main scientific and technical objectives: (I) demonstrate massively parallel high throughput microfluidic arrays for real-time, high data-density measurements of bacterial growth in light, (II) demonstrate a robust paradigm for photosynthetic efficiency and explore bacterial growth using data-intensive video imaging and single cell recognition, and (III) demonstrate a new optical multi-band correlation spectroscopy technique to examine the physics of noisy antennae in the light harvesting network of photosynthetic bacteria. We anticipate that measurements conducted using the proposed apparatus \u2013 the Ultra-Parallelized Microfluidic Photobiology Microscope - will give remarkably rich insight into microbial processes under illumination. In its simplest form, we will gain precise control of optical excitation at the single cell level. Our work focuses on exposing basic operating principles in complex biological networks, a burgeoning field of study that bridges physics, biology, and chemistry. No current field of research utilizes the synergistic approaches here, and the expected impact of our work may upend the current state of knowledge of light sensing in biosystems.less",

The University of California, Riverside (UCR) \u2013 one of America\u2019s few accredited research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions (OPEID-00131600) \u2013 has active programs in partnership with nearby community colleges that enable students to transfer and complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in science or engineering in four years. This project will expand on those efforts to enlarge and sustain the pipeline with a series of services to students that begin in the first year of college and continue beyond their transfer to UCR. These will include academic advising, tutoring, engagement with professional engineering organizations, events and lectures, and undergraduate research opportunities at UCR. Students will build expertise and enthusiasm in many areas of engineering that are important to the Navy by participating in UCR research projects (many of which are supported by the Office of Naval Research or other Navy organizations) and in-classroom exercises that allow for independent discovery and innovation. A major strength of this project is its foundation on well-established approaches and relationships, based on the literature and on our experiences over several years. It builds on projects that have been successful, but that have operated only intermittently, rising and falling with the availability of grants from various sources. Now, with California\u2019s new emphasis on the postsecondary transfer pipeline, we will be able to solidify our relationships with community colleges in the region under support from this ONR program and sustain these programs for long-term benefits. The outcome will be a steady flow of students from Southern California community colleges (all of which are also accredited Hispanic Serving Institutions) to UCR, where they will complete bachelor\u2019s degrees and research/design projects based in part on current research projects sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division.

Specifically, we will quantify the motion of magnetic moments of metal alloys in response to heat-currents and laser irradiation. This will allow for the identifications of atomic-composition/magnetic-transport-property relationships in magnetic metal systems. Understanding these relationships will allow us to design material systems with novel functionalities for electronically or optically writing information at ultrafast speeds and with ultralow powers. An innovative force that will help drive these discoveries is the development of a unique scientific tool-kit at UCR. We will combine high-throughput materials synthesis, characterization, and big-data computational analysis. This tool-kit will dramatically accelerate scientific discoveries in the domain of magnetic transport phenomena and therefore strengthen DoD research capabilities at UCR. A key component of this research project is its integration with research education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate student levels. The emphasis of the research educational efforts will be on the Hispanic communities of Southern California\u00d5s Inland Empire region. Our location in the Inland Empire provides us opportunities for STEM research education outreach to Hispanic communities. At the K-12 level, we will work with wellestablished programs to provide demonstrations and hands-on-learning opportunities at localscience fairs and campus-sponsored public events, e.g. Bourns Engineering day, STEMapalooza, and UCR/CTY outreach. At the undergraduate level, we will directly involve undergraduate researchers in hands-on-projects to improve existing experimental apparatuses with highthroughput methodologies. For graduate education, this project will have spill-over effects on the students in our research groups. Furthermore, this project will help provide them with experience and skills in cutting-edge scientific methods that are coveted by industry.less",

        "abstract": "Air-Breathing combustion either subsonic or supersonic has received renewed interest but is still challenged by some fundamental limitations. In the case of super-to-hypersonic combustion, oxidizer starvation is a major consideration. As a result, solid-fuel ram/scramjets are plagued with a very narrow operating envelope and unstable combustion properties. This arises due to poor flame holding characteristics, high ignition temperature, short residence times of particles, and mass transfer limitation of the oxidizer. Most efforts to mitigate these constraints focus on fluid dynamic effects.In this proposal we will consider alternative chemical approaches and fabrication methods to enable a new class of propellent which may offer wider operational windows and more efficient combustion. We will utilize nanomaterials as fuel constituents and develop assembly methods toallow bulk scale fabrication. We will test these new materials and develop optimized formulation and we will apply advanced diagnostics to interrogate these processes from a fundamental point of view so that eth knowledge bases gained will be of utility to further research by others.less",

Here, the energy in photons is stored, exchanged and transferred in the form of spin-active excited states. This fundamental research will establish for the first time, the basis for the transfer of spin-doublet energy between semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and organic radicals. Once the physical parameters governing doublet energy transfer have been established, then these open-shell molecules will be able to augment the weak absorption of indirect gap silicon QDs in the near-infrared window I for photon upconversion. This ubiquitous and environmentally benign hybrid system has great potential for many applications in the life-sciences where blue or violet light is required in living tissue, for example, pain mitigation, oxygen detection, optogenetics and sensing. Here, important structure-property relationships will be obtained from well-defined CdSe QDs functionalized with specially designed open-shell molecules to have the appropriate wavefunction overlap and driving force for doublet energy transfer. Zinc blende and wurtzite CdSe QDs of different sizes will be investigated for the efficacy of spin-doublet photosensitization to surface bound organic radicals. Subsequent doublet-triplet energy transfer to emissive molecules by these organic radicals provides a simple yet accurate way to quantify the efficiency of this doublet photosensitization and energy transfer. Photon upconversion via the fusion of triplet excited states of diphenylanthracene or tetra(tert-butyl)perylene will report on the electronic communication within this hybrid nanostructure.less",

These will be evaluated to obtain reaction font thickness, temperature profile, micro burn rates and velocity distributions, suitable for model validation. In Task 2 we will, using 3-D printing methods to fabricate polymer nanocomposites. We will be exploring the reaction front and the pre-heat zone by imaging, and chemistry by mass spectrometry. One focus is how to change the nature of the reaction front to increase energy delivery rate and minimize particle sintering. We will also be exploring a new concept using 'unzipping polymers' to generate more gas and minimize particle sintering as well as change the pre-heat zone. In Task 3 Another approach to manipulate the reaction front will use low temperature reactive gas generators, specifically metal hydrides to generate hydrogen to promote combustion and to propel particles away from each other to minimize sintering.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being increasingly used in several sensitive applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, malware classification, and network intrusion detection. However, the robustness of DNNs and their effectiveness have raised significant concerns; for example, there has been a surge in adversarial example attacks against them. Currently most DNNs do not account for a rich variety of information that is available in the input. For example, in images, they do not recognize if an object is out of place in a scene or in relation to other objects in that scene; similarly, inappropriate values in packet fields, or across a train of packets, are not accounted for by ML based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). In this project we propose to develop robust ML models that learn relationships across the components of an input (e.g., objects in an image, or header fields in a packet), which we refer to as context, and check for consistencies when making inferences relating to security. We believe, as supported by our preliminary experiments, that context can significantly harden ML models, and also improve their effectiveness in security applications. First, the project will make significant leaps beyond our initial endeavors to consider multiple visual sensors and multi-modal sensing (e.g., visual and LiDAR). Extracting context from multiple sources, is expected to significantly improve the fidelity of the inferences, and increase robustness to adversarial subversion. Second, a deep exploration into what types of context will be effective, and what can be easily defeated by attackers will be carried out, via developing an understanding of the attack surface projected by context-based defenses, and a principled approach to tune and evaluate different forms of context. Finally, the lessons learned in the visual and sensor spaces, will be carried over to the cyber-space, where the structure of the inputs, and the constraints imposed in terms of what types of context can be extracted, make the problem more challenging, but has promise in the development of secure ML based solutions to cyber-security. The project includes an extensive validation plan involving multiple datasets (including multi-sensor/modal sets, network intrusion detection and malware datasets) and emulations on an in house camera networks vehicles and a large scale software defined network testbed. The proposed work is expected to significantly enhance the army capabilities in terms of robust surveillance and security, especially given that future ISR and command and control applications will heavily deploy machine learning. The research in the attack space, can also provide the army with an understanding of threats, and also gain the first mover advantage in tactical cyber- warfare.less",

        "abstract": "The objective of this project is to develop multiscale simulation tools for coupled carrier-phonon transport in micro/optoelectronic devices and to explore novel concepts of phonon engineering for heat removal and termal management in advancedsemiconductor devices. The phase I effort resulted in a prototype software modules for multiscale simulation of phonon dynamics in LD semiconductors and proven feasibility of using phonon annihilation for heat reduction in electronic devices. It has beenobserved that if phonon waves of different phase interact, they could, under the right set of circumstances, cause either constructive or destructive interference. CFDRC and UCR team plans to use existing commercial Multiphysics CFD-ACE+ softwareenvironment as a platform to implement comprehensive multiscale (quantum to continum) modeling tools for phonon engineering and couple it to existing carrier, optical and thermal models. We will utilize the tools for detailed examination of new methods ofheat reduction by phonon engineering such as generation of coherent confined acoustic phonons by drifting electrons in LD structures, investigation of the effects of the acoustic impedance mismatch, phonon filters by using Q dots/wire gratings, periodicphonon bandgap structures,less",
