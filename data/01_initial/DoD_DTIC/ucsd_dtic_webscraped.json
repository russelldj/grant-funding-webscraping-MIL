        "abstract": "Many organisms that thrive at cold temperatures have evolved biomolecules to control ice formation. The commonality of these molecules is their ability to bind ice, although their functions can be quite distinct: they can be antifreeze or ice nucleating. Proteins excel at both functions. However, they are expensive to produce in large quantities for applications that allow them to prevent and control ice formation on large surfaces. Understanding how proteins bind to ice and determine what characteristics make them good antifreeze or ice nucleating agents is key to designing new molecules that excel at preventing ice growth and recrystallization, controlling ice nucleation, and facilitating de-icing, which is the focus of this MURI project. This MURI integrates multi-scale multi-resolution computer simulations and theory with state-of-the-art experimental techniques probing properties at different length and time scales, biochemical synthesis, and machine learning to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and interactions that control ice recognition, formation and adhesion. The main aims are: 1) To elucidate the diversity of chemical motifs that bind strongly to ice, and identify signatures in the structure and dynamics of hydration of ice-binding molecules that can predict their strength of ice-binding; 2) To develop a multi-scale multi-resolution modeling approach that identifies and accounts for all steps in the reaction network responsible for antifreeze and ice recrystallization inhibition activities, and design and synthesize new ice binding materials with improved antifreeze activity; 3) To elucidate how biological and organic molecules and crystals nucleate ice, use that knowledge to identify and design materials that nucleate ice without supercooling, and develop a biomimetic approach to ice nucleation; and 4) To develop new experimental and simulation techniques to probe buried ice interfaces, and to characterize the properties of the premelted layer.less",

MPL was established 76 years ago at the close of WWII in recognition for the need of a University-based laboratory to conduct navy relevant basic research. A majority of the MPL academic community are involved in ONR-funded, seagoing research to study air-sea interaction, underwater acoustics and marine bioacoustics, physical oceanography, marine optics, radar oceanography, and marine robotics. A hallmark of MPL is the engineering and data analytics associated with conducting and interpreting novel measurements of the ocean to understand physical processes. While students are traditionally involved in research through the budgeting of graduate student stipends within research grants, there is excess opportunity to involve more students in the vibrant research programs at MPL. In addition, research grants are typically shorter (3 years) than the required time to obtain a Ph.D. (5-6 years), often resulting in instabilities late in a graduate student\u2019s tenure. This proposal seeks to stabilize and expand the educational and training opportunities at MPL, with the intention to increase the next-generation, sea-going workforce to support problems of national interest.

The focus of NESCAFE is to understand and improve the acoustic propagation prediction capabilities of an ocean model in a highly dynamic region. The Gulf Stream crosses the e xperimental area and its influence will be challenging for both the ocean and the acoustic models. A pilot deployment has thus been proposed to validate the basic scales of variability before the main deployment. Planning for the experiment has revealed that chang es in the acoustic arrival pattern are expected to be large and occur rapidly. The changes are likely to violate the typical assumpt ion of linearity and will demand new methods to be developed. The most highly variable component is the upper few hundred meters of the ocean. This layer changes from well-mixed in the winter to stratified in the summer. The presence of the warm Gulf Stream leads to sharp fronts that move rapidly and significantly affect the sound speed. An acoustically important layer is the relatively warmer mode water at 18C that is located at about 100-500 m. This layer forms a thermopause, a region of weak thermocline gradient, embe dded in the stronger main thermocline. The weak temperature gradient leads to a weak sound speed gradient that transitions to a stro ng main thermocline gradient around 500 m. This transition zone between weak and strong gradients is associated with a rapid diverge nce of ray paths. Furthermore, since the mode water has a weak gradient, any perturbation due to Gulf Stream meanders, eddies, or in ternal waves can result in the formation of a subsurface or secondary acoustic duct that is located above the main thermocline. Soun d trapped in this layer will experience little loss but will also be highly variable as the mode water is modulated by the Gulf Stre am. The experimental geometry seeks to acoustically probe this layer and investigate the limits of our current measuring and modelin g capabilities. The main challenge of this experiment will be to see if the acoustic arrival pattern of the observations is predicta ble based upon the available environmental information? The environmental information can come from climatology, ocean models, or lo cal observations. For identified ray paths or ducted modes we seek to answer two further questions: 1) Can the acoustic observations be used to infer properties of the sound-speed profiles? and 2) Can we predict the statistics of the arrivals? The central question s are: How much environmental information is necessary to reliably predict the acoustic propagation observations? For what length of time can an ocean model skillfully predict the acoustic arrival patterns. What are the impacts on signal detection, coherence, and tracking?Our goal is to explore the fundamental limits of acoustic signal processing and to exploit the remote sensing capabilities of acoustics jointly with ocean models to characterize acoustic signal propagation. The data and skills obtained by this experiment will improve our ability to monitor, communicate, and navigate in one of the most highly dynamic parts of the ocean.Approved for Pu blic Releaseless",

Our Norwegian partner is the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) in Bergen, led by Hanne Sagen. The CAATEX experiment would take advantage of MOSAiC, an International ArcticScience Committee (IASC) sponsored project, in which an icebreaker, the R/V Polarstern, will drift across the Eastern Arctic in the Transpolar Drift from summer 2019 to summer 2020. Transmissions from an acoustic source deployed from the icebreaker will enable remote sensing of the Arctic basin. The NERSC proposal for the source deployment and three receivers has beenfunded by the Norwegian Research Council. We propose to deploy three receivers in the western Arctic. The furthest north receiver will also have an acoustic source that will be capable of being detected at all the other moorings.This proposed experiment is designed to be comparable to previous trans-Arctic propagation experiments conducted in the 1990s. The drift track and multiple receivers of CAATEX will allow for an expansion of the measurements throughout the basin. The comparisons will contrast present day heat content to the past measurements, but there are several other points of comparison. These include transmission loss, which depends in part on the ratio of first-year ice to older ice; acoustic scattering, which diagnoses the strength of internal-wave activity; and the acoustic arrival structure, which changes with the vertical stratification. The CAATEX combination of a drifting and a moored source will provide a powerful space-time sampling of the Arctic basin. More capable receiving arrays and a compact sound source that can be deployedfrom a ship and on a mooring will be able to extend the analysis beyond previous work. Our goal is to explore the fundamental limits of acoustic signal processing and to exploit the remote sensing capabilities of acoustics to characterize the large-scale properties of the Arctic Ocean. The measurements of physical ocean and ice processes, and of the acoustic signal propagation and ambient noise obtained by this experiment will improve our ability to monitor,to communicate and to navigate in the Arctic Ocean.less",

About 75% of the worlds coastlines are rocky, limiting current Naval accessibility. By avoiding these rocky shores, the Navy is predicta ble. In contrast to well-studied sandy shores, rocky shores are inherently multiscale with complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries at scales of cm to 100s m. Multi-scale bottom variability has strong effects on wave processes, such as scattering, reflection, non linear energy transfers, and dissipation that are dramatically different than on sandy beaches. Rocky shores are exposed to large wa ves that strongly affect water-column turbulence and wave-driven inner shelf and surf zone currents (rip currents, undertow). The ap plicability of existing models developed for low-sloped, sandy beaches in predicting rocky shores wave propagation, circulation and turbulence is unknown, nor is what new physics must be included to make accurate predictions. As part of ROXSI, four central C rnia field experiments will occur from Big Sur to Santa Cruz spanning different canonical rocky shores types, based on bottom roughn ess from existing highresolution bathymetric surveys, shoreline type and complexity, wave climate, local knowledge, and logistics. T hese field sites are representative of rocky shores found worldwide. The proposed experiments use nested in situ arrays together wit h remote sensing to capture wave and circulation gradients and processes at different scales. The arrays will extend from 40-m water depth through the intertidal zone and span a few kilometers in the alongshore. The instrument arrays will be arranged along lines p arallel and perpendicular to shore to synchronously and asynchronously measure wave transformation and circulation patterns across s cales of 10 m - 1 km. For <10 m scale, a small-scale coherent array will be deployed around rocky obstacles to make detailed measure ments of processes that dissipate energy and alter wave properties. Ground- and UASbased lidar and optical remote sensing will measu re the time-evolving 2D wave field from the intertidal to offshore, capturing the transformation of nonlinear directionally-spread w aves propagating over complex rocky bathymetry, wave breaking and dissipation, and wave-induced currents via foam streaks. Vessel-ba sed observations and surface drifters will augment in situ moorings and ground-truth remote sensing measures. A suite of numerical m odel simulations will quantify fundamental water column processes, wave transformation and circulation dynamics on rocky shores. Hig E model simulations will determine the relative importance of wave scattering and dissipation due to bottom friction, and improve ex isting parameterizations in community wave models SWAN and WAVEWATCH III (WW3). Also, NHWAVE and COAWST (consisting of ROMS and SWAN /WW3) model simulations at a resolution of O(1-5 m) will be configured for the four field study sites to determine ideal instrument deployment design, and will be validated against observations from the inner-shelf to the intertidal zone. These comparisons will p rovide further improvements to parameterizations for wave scattering and dissipation due to bottom friction. Finally, high resolutio n SOMAR LES, at a resolution of O (0.01-2 m) and NHWAVE run at typical wave propagation scales will examine internal wave processes on rocky shores, and determine the applicability and limitations of hydrostatic community models such as ROMS.less",

We will use the TESLA climate emulator, and a coupled numerical modeling approach that links CMIP6 atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM) output with wave and tide/storm surge models. The models will be used to assess high-tide flooding, as well as vulnerabilities to extreme events associated with storms and energetic swell. Surrogate models will be used to bring wave energy to the shore. TESLA opens opportunities to consider scenario-driven risks in high temporal and spatial resolution and provides a framework for assessing heavy rains and compound flooding events. The AOGCM approach establishes an explicit dynamical link between TWL and CMIP6 climate simulations. We will explore optimal vulnerability assessments based on a hybrid approach using these two modeling systems. Foundational adaptive capacity research for Guam and Hawaii will involve, i) a review of local military/civilian planning history to assess the character of interactions, ii) a planning document review and analysis to identify joint military/civilian planning processes, adaptation planning processes, and points of synergy and tension between military and civilian decision-makers, iii) spatial analysis to determine social vulnerability aspects on and off-base and iv) organizational mapping of the local community of practice involved in adaptation planning extending from military to civilian entities and community-based organizations. The team will conduct initial outreach to community-based organizations to help identify community members who would be willing to participate in interviews or focus groups. In collaboration with the modeling team, we will determine opportunities for stakeholders to inform the modeling process and emphasis.-The flood risk simulations and interdependencies and vulnerability analyses will be used to test and evaluate how various decision-making frameworks can be utilized to optimize on and offbase collaborative strategies for adaptation. Focus groups including military and civilian decision-makers will be assembled to test responses to the model outputs and assess the sociopolitical and physical feasibility of developing adaptation options predicated on those outputs.These focus groups also will probe how decision-making processes may be improved to identify and align interlinkages between base and community vulnerabilities. We will evaluate decision making processes through Table Top Exercises that consider Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. The results will inform a decision-making framework that integrates social and organizational factors with awareness of physical exposure.

Similarly, challenges exist in observing the physics in this domain where gradients in environmental fields are sub-grid scale to the resolution of modelling tools. The proposed work will advance observational techniques for assessing environmental impacts on RF propagation with a particular focus on the role of surface waves, turbulent boundary layers, and the coupling physics that occur at sharp oceanic gradients (e.g. fronts). Novel to this work is the use of unmanned vehicles with specialized payloads, radar systems, and advanced autonomy algorithms in a synthesized framework for collecting adaptive measurements in real-time. These measurements will be used to improve the representation of sub-grid scale processes in numerical prediction tools. The proposed work will include the analysis of relevant ONR sponsored datasets and the collection of new observational datasets in the Western Pacific region. We propose to continue a trajectory of developing tools to observe this complex environment, collecting new observations, and interpreting those observations both in the context of physical processes and numerical prediction tools. This research will include the collection of data sets in the Pacific, identify gaps in present day prediction tools, and provide scientific results to underpin future research investments.less",

The research findings were published in over 50 peer review journal publications, including high impact journals such as Science, Nature, Nano Letters, ASC Nano, Optica and Scientific Reports. The research results on nonlinear metamaterials and meta-devices are compatible with CMOS manufacturing process being developed by American Institute for Manufacturing Photonics, and the developed technology will have an impact on future computing and communication systems.Grant AddendumOPTION 1: 30 JUN 2016 - 28 JUL 2018 $3,000,000.00ObjectiveThe performers intend to maximize the induced asymmetric strain in silicon through several complementary techniques. Team will investigate various material compositions and geometries in an effort to enhance the second order nonlinearity attainable in silicon by at least a factor of ten relative to the state-of-the-art. As an example, we will explore the integration of both tensile and compressive silicon nitride films into silicon waveguides. We predict that the arrangement of both tensile and compressive straining elements, in a push-pull configuration, may additionally boost the induced optical nonlinearity. Combining this with the optimization of various processing parameters, such as those involved in Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and sputtering, should increase the generated nonlinearities even further. Additionally, research will make use of materials possessing different thermal expansion coefficients, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, gold, and germanium. The last of these has already been used in microelectronics to produce tensile stress in silicon. By exploring a wide range of material compositions and geometries, we anticipate the realization of optical nonlinearities significantly greater than those previously reported. These geometrically-dependent nonlinearities will subsequently be co-optimized with specific device structures. By maximizing the spatial overlap of these nonlinear materials with the optical modes of the nanoresonators, team will demonstrate devices with unparalleled switching speeds, physical dimensions, and energy efficiencies. Overall MeritsThe proposed work is of sufficient technical merit to warrant funding and is in the best interest of the Government. This proposal presents a coherent vision for advances in the science and technology of Nanophotonics with an aggressive but balanced approach to research. Finally, the proposal clearly noted the beneficial impact the effort could have not only on digital systems but also analog systems highly relevant to the DoD.Short Statement of WorkPerformers are to investigate deeply sub-wavelength composites in the optical frequency regime, engineered on atomic and/or the scale of a few atomic layers, which will exhibit a qualitatively different response to radiation than that predicted by theless",

This proposal will instrument one, internal-wave resolving (IWR) array that is re-deployable to multiple locations. The IWR Array proposed here comprises two pressure, sensor equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) and five PIESs with an additional current-sensor on each (CPIESs) and a densely instrumented, full-depth mooring. The C/PIES antenna will allow for the detection and separation of low-mode internal waves propagating, from multiple directions, while the mooring will measure velocity and vertical displacement signals of five or more vertical modes. The array has been designed, and the data will be examined, in cooperation with a numerical modeling team (see the Buijsman et al. NOPP submission from our collaborators at USM, University of Michigan; U-M, and the Naval Research Laboratory; NRL) allowing for skill-testing and direct comparison with the global internal-tide resolving models that serve as inputs to regional models of the coastal ocean. The IWR Array deployment will be made in collaboration with the NASA JPL Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Cal/Val mooring deployments in 2023 off the California coast. Part of the proposed IWR Array deployment period will coincide with SWOTs 90-day fast-sampling phase which will provide once per day repeat sampling and the IRW Array will extend (in time) and augment (in space) NASAs internal wave observations planned for the Cal/Val location.

Operational endurance is a framework priority for Navy R&D. Current goals include findi,ng improvements in platform-level energy storage, and in efficiency of propulsion and weapons systems. The design and future operati,on of the hybrid research vessel matches with the Office of Naval Research published research subtopics of power generation, storage,, energy efficiency, high-performance materials, hydrogen bunkering, survivability, endurance, and availability. Our proposed projec,t will inform the development of shipboard systems that are more adaptive, agile, defensible, efficient, and sustainable.less",
