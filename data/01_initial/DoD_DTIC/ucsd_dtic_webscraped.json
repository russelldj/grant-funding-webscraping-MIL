The commonality of these molecules is their ability to bind ice, although their functions can be quite distinct: they can be antifreeze or ice nucleating. Proteins excel at both functions. However, they are expensive to produce in large quantities for applications that allow them to prevent and control ice formation on large surfaces. Understanding how proteins bind to ice and determine what characteristics make them good antifreeze or ice nucleating agents is key to designing new molecules that excel at preventing ice growth and recrystallization, controlling ice nucleation, and facilitating de-icing, which is the focus of this MURI project. This MURI integrates multi-scale multi-resolution computer simulations and theory with state-of-the-art experimental techniques probing properties at different length and time scales, biochemical synthesis, and machine learning to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and interactions that control ice recognition, formation and adhesion. The main aims are: 1) To elucidate the diversity of chemical motifs that bind strongly to ice, and identify signatures in the structure and dynamics of hydration of ice-binding molecules that can predict their strength of ice-binding; 2) To develop a multi-scale multi-resolution modeling approach that identifies and accounts for all steps in the reaction network responsible for antifreeze and ice recrystallization inhibition activities, and design and synthesize new ice binding materials with improved antifreeze activity; 3) To elucidate how biological and organic molecules and crystals nucleate ice, use that knowledge to identify and design materials that nucleate ice without supercooling, and develop a biomimetic approach to ice nucleation; and 4) To develop new experimental and simulation techniques to probe buried ice interfaces, and to characterize the properties of the premelted layer.less",

MPL was established 76 years ago at the close of WWII in recognition for the need of a University-based laboratory to conduct navy relevant basic research. A majority of the MPL academic community are involved in ONR-funded, seagoing research to study air-sea interaction, underwater acoustics and marine bioacoustics, physical oceanography, marine optics, radar oceanography, and marine robotics. A hallmark of MPL is the engineering and data analytics associated with conducting and interpreting novel measurements of the ocean to understand physical processes. While students are traditionally involved in research through the budgeting of graduate student stipends within research grants, there is excess opportunity to involve more students in the vibrant research programs at MPL. In addition, research grants are typically shorter (3 years) than the required time to obtain a Ph.D. (5-6 years), often resulting in instabilities late in a graduate student\u2019s tenure. This proposal seeks to stabilize and expand the educational and training opportunities at MPL, with the intention to increase the next-generation, sea-going workforce to support problems of national interest. As a pilot program in support of Task Force Ocean, MPL will create the TFO 10+2 program: support of 10 graduate students and 2 post docs to augment existing ONR graduate student and post doc support.less",

The focus of NESCAFE is to understand and improve the acoustic propagation prediction capabilities of an ocean model in a highly dynamic region. The Gulf Stream crosses the e xperimental area and its influence will be challenging for both the ocean and the acoustic models. A pilot deployment has thus been proposed to validate the basic scales of variability before the main deployment. Planning for the experiment has revealed that chang es in the acoustic arrival pattern are expected to be large and occur rapidly. The changes are likely to violate the typical assumpt ion of linearity and will demand new methods to be developed. The most highly variable component is the upper few hundred meters of the ocean. This layer changes from well-mixed in the winter to stratified in the summer. The presence of the warm Gulf Stream leads to sharp fronts that move rapidly and significantly affect the sound speed. An acoustically important layer is the relatively warmer mode water at 18C that is located at about 100-500 m. This layer forms a thermopause, a region of weak thermocline gradient, embe dded in the stronger main thermocline. The weak temperature gradient leads to a weak sound speed gradient that transitions to a stro ng main thermocline gradient around 500 m. This transition zone between weak and strong gradients is associated with a rapid diverge nce of ray paths. Furthermore, since the mode water has a weak gradient, any perturbation due to Gulf Stream meanders, eddies, or in ternal waves can result in the formation of a subsurface or secondary acoustic duct that is located above the main thermocline. Soun d trapped in this layer will experience little loss but will also be highly variable as the mode water is modulated by the Gulf Stre am. The experimental geometry seeks to acoustically probe this layer and investigate the limits of our current measuring and modelin g capabilities. The main challenge of this experiment will be to see if the acoustic arrival pattern of the observations is predicta ble based upon the available environmental information? The environmental information can come from climatology, ocean models, or lo cal observations. For identified ray paths or ducted modes we seek to answer two further questions: 1) Can the acoustic observations be used to infer properties of the sound-speed profiles? and 2) Can we predict the statistics of the arrivals? The central question s are: How much environmental information is necessary to reliably predict the acoustic propagation observations? For what length of time can an ocean model skillfully predict the acoustic arrival patterns. What are the impacts on signal detection, coherence, and tracking?Our goal is to explore the fundamental limits of acoustic signal processing and to exploit the remote sensing capabilities of acoustics jointly with ocean models to characterize acoustic signal propagation. The data and skills obtained by this experiment will improve our ability to monitor, communicate, and navigate in one of the most highly dynamic parts of the ocean.Approved for Pu blic Releaseless",

Our Norwegian partner is the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) in Bergen, led by Hanne Sagen. The CAATEX experiment would take advantage of MOSAiC, an International ArcticScience Committee (IASC) sponsored project, in which an icebreaker, the R/V Polarstern, will drift across the Eastern Arctic in the Transpolar Drift from summer 2019 to summer 2020. Transmissions from an acoustic source deployed from the icebreaker will enable remote sensing of the Arctic basin. The NERSC proposal for the source deployment and three receivers has beenfunded by the Norwegian Research Council. We propose to deploy three receivers in the western Arctic. The furthest north receiver will also have an acoustic source that will be capable of being detected at all the other moorings.This proposed experiment is designed to be comparable to previous trans-Arctic propagation experiments conducted in the 1990s. The drift track and multiple receivers of CAATEX will allow for an expansion of the measurements throughout the basin. The comparisons will contrast present day heat content to the past measurements, but there are several other points of comparison. These include transmission loss, which depends in part on the ratio of first-year ice to older ice; acoustic scattering, which diagnoses the strength of internal-wave activity; and the acoustic arrival structure, which changes with the vertical stratification. The CAATEX combination of a drifting and a moored source will provide a powerful space-time sampling of the Arctic basin. More capable receiving arrays and a compact sound source that can be deployedfrom a ship and on a mooring will be able to extend the analysis beyond previous work. Our goal is to explore the fundamental limits of acoustic signal processing and to exploit the remote sensing capabilities of acoustics to characterize the large-scale properties of the Arctic Ocean. The measurements of physical ocean and ice processes, and of the acoustic signal propagation and ambient noise obtained by this experiment will improve our ability to monitor,to communicate and to navigate in the Arctic Ocean.less",

About 75% of the worlds coastlines are rocky, limiting current Naval accessibility. By avoiding these rocky shores, the Navy is predicta ble. In contrast to well-studied sandy shores, rocky shores are inherently multiscale with complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries at scales of cm to 100s m. Multi-scale bottom variability has strong effects on wave processes, such as scattering, reflection, non linear energy transfers, and dissipation that are dramatically different than on sandy beaches. Rocky shores are exposed to large wa ves that strongly affect water-column turbulence and wave-driven inner shelf and surf zone currents (rip currents, undertow). The ap plicability of existing models developed for low-sloped, sandy beaches in predicting rocky shores wave propagation, circulation and turbulence is unknown, nor is what new physics must be included to make accurate predictions. As part of ROXSI, four central C rnia field experiments will occur from Big Sur to Santa Cruz spanning different canonical rocky shores types, based on bottom roughn ess from existing highresolution bathymetric surveys, shoreline type and complexity, wave climate, local knowledge, and logistics. T hese field sites are representative of rocky shores found worldwide. The proposed experiments use nested in situ arrays together wit h remote sensing to capture wave and circulation gradients and processes at different scales. The arrays will extend from 40-m water depth through the intertidal zone and span a few kilometers in the alongshore. The instrument arrays will be arranged along lines p arallel and perpendicular to shore to synchronously and asynchronously measure wave transformation and circulation patterns across s cales of 10 m - 1 km. For <10 m scale, a small-scale coherent array will be deployed around rocky obstacles to make detailed measure ments of processes that dissipate energy and alter wave properties. Ground- and UASbased lidar and optical remote sensing will measu re the time-evolving 2D wave field from the intertidal to offshore, capturing the transformation of nonlinear directionally-spread w aves propagating over complex rocky bathymetry, wave breaking and dissipation, and wave-induced currents via foam streaks. Vessel-ba sed observations and surface drifters will augment in situ moorings and ground-truth remote sensing measures. A suite of numerical m odel simulations will quantify fundamental water column processes, wave transformation and circulation dynamics on rocky shores. Hig E model simulations will determine the relative importance of wave scattering and dissipation due to bottom friction, and improve ex isting parameterizations in community wave models SWAN and WAVEWATCH III (WW3). Also, NHWAVE and COAWST (consisting of ROMS and SWAN /WW3) model simulations at a resolution of O(1-5 m) will be configured for the four field study sites to determine ideal instrument deployment design, and will be validated against observations from the inner-shelf to the intertidal zone. These comparisons will p rovide further improvements to parameterizations for wave scattering and dissipation due to bottom friction. Finally, high resolutio n SOMAR LES, at a resolution of O (0.01-2 m) and NHWAVE run at typical wave propagation scales will examine internal wave processes on rocky shores, and determine the applicability and limitations of hydrostatic community models such as ROMS.less",

We will use the TESLA climate emulator, and a coupled numerical modeling approach that links CMIP6 atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM) output with wave and tide/storm surge models. The models will be used to assess high-tide flooding, as well as vulnerabilities to extreme events associated with storms and energetic swell. Surrogate models will be used to bring wave energy to the shore. TESLA opens opportunities to consider scenario-driven risks in high temporal and spatial resolution and provides a framework for assessing heavy rains and compound flooding events. The AOGCM approach establishes an explicit dynamical link between TWL and CMIP6 climate simulations. We will explore optimal vulnerability assessments based on a hybrid approach using these two modeling systems. Foundational adaptive capacity research for Guam and Hawaii will involve, i) a review of local military/civilian planning history to assess the character of interactions, ii) a planning document review and analysis to identify joint military/civilian planning processes, adaptation planning processes, and points of synergy and tension between military and civilian decision-makers, iii) spatial analysis to determine social vulnerability aspects on and off-base and iv) organizational mapping of the local community of practice involved in adaptation planning extending from military to civilian entities and community-based organizations. The team will conduct initial outreach to community-based organizations to help identify community members who would be willing to participate in interviews or focus groups. In collaboration with the modeling team, we will determine opportunities for stakeholders to inform the modeling process and emphasis.-The flood risk simulations and interdependencies and vulnerability analyses will be used to test and evaluate how various decision-making frameworks can be utilized to optimize on and offbase collaborative strategies for adaptation. Focus groups including military and civilian decision-makers will be assembled to test responses to the model outputs and assess the sociopolitical and physical feasibility of developing adaptation options predicated on those outputs.These focus groups also will probe how decision-making processes may be improved to identify and align interlinkages between base and community vulnerabilities. We will evaluate decision making processes through Table Top Exercises that consider Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. The results will inform a decision-making framework that integrates social and organizational factors with awareness of physical exposure.

Similarly, challenges exist in observing the physics in this domain where gradients in environmental fields are sub-grid scale to the resolution of modelling tools. The proposed work will advance observational techniques for assessing environmental impacts on RF propagation with a particular focus on the role of surface waves, turbulent boundary layers, and the coupling physics that occur at sharp oceanic gradients (e.g. fronts). Novel to this work is the use of unmanned vehicles with specialized payloads, radar systems, and advanced autonomy algorithms in a synthesized framework for collecting adaptive measurements in real-time. These measurements will be used to improve the representation of sub-grid scale processes in numerical prediction tools. The proposed work will include the analysis of relevant ONR sponsored datasets and the collection of new observational datasets in the Western Pacific region. We propose to continue a trajectory of developing tools to observe this complex environment, collecting new observations, and interpreting those observations both in the context of physical processes and numerical prediction tools. This research will include the collection of data sets in the Pacific, identify gaps in present day prediction tools, and provide scientific results to underpin future research investments.less",

The research findings were published in over 50 peer review journal publications, including high impact journals such as Science, Nature, Nano Letters, ASC Nano, Optica and Scientific Reports. The research results on nonlinear metamaterials and meta-devices are compatible with CMOS manufacturing process being developed by American Institute for Manufacturing Photonics, and the developed technology will have an impact on future computing and communication systems.Grant AddendumOPTION 1: 30 JUN 2016 - 28 JUL 2018 $3,000,000.00ObjectiveThe performers intend to maximize the induced asymmetric strain in silicon through several complementary techniques. Team will investigate various material compositions and geometries in an effort to enhance the second order nonlinearity attainable in silicon by at least a factor of ten relative to the state-of-the-art. As an example, we will explore the integration of both tensile and compressive silicon nitride films into silicon waveguides. We predict that the arrangement of both tensile and compressive straining elements, in a push-pull configuration, may additionally boost the induced optical nonlinearity. Combining this with the optimization of various processing parameters, such as those involved in Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and sputtering, should increase the generated nonlinearities even further. Additionally, research will make use of materials possessing different thermal expansion coefficients, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, gold, and germanium. The last of these has already been used in microelectronics to produce tensile stress in silicon. By exploring a wide range of material compositions and geometries, we anticipate the realization of optical nonlinearities significantly greater than those previously reported. These geometrically-dependent nonlinearities will subsequently be co-optimized with specific device structures. By maximizing the spatial overlap of these nonlinear materials with the optical modes of the nanoresonators, team will demonstrate devices with unparalleled switching speeds, physical dimensions, and energy efficiencies. Overall MeritsThe proposed work is of sufficient technical merit to warrant funding and is in the best interest of the Government. This proposal presents a coherent vision for advances in the science and technology of Nanophotonics with an aggressive but balanced approach to research. Finally, the proposal clearly noted the beneficial impact the effort could have not only on digital systems but also analog systems highly relevant to the DoD.Short Statement of WorkPerformers are to investigate deeply sub-wavelength composites in the optical frequency regime, engineered on atomic and/or the scale of a few atomic layers, which will exhibit a qualitatively different response to radiation than that predicted by theless",

This proposal will instrument one, internal-wave resolving (IWR) array that is re-deployable to multiple locations. The IWR Array proposed here comprises two pressure, sensor equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) and five PIESs with an additional current-sensor on each (CPIESs) and a densely instrumented, full-depth mooring. The C/PIES antenna will allow for the detection and separation of low-mode internal waves propagating, from multiple directions, while the mooring will measure velocity and vertical displacement signals of five or more vertical modes. The array has been designed, and the data will be examined, in cooperation with a numerical modeling team (see the Buijsman et al. NOPP submission from our collaborators at USM, University of Michigan; U-M, and the Naval Research Laboratory; NRL) allowing for skill-testing and direct comparison with the global internal-tide resolving models that serve as inputs to regional models of the coastal ocean. The IWR Array deployment will be made in collaboration with the NASA JPL Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Cal/Val mooring deployments in 2023 off the California coast. Part of the proposed IWR Array deployment period will coincide with SWOTs 90-day fast-sampling phase which will provide once per day repeat sampling and the IRW Array will extend (in time) and augment (in space) NASAs internal wave observations planned for the Cal/Val location.

        "abstract": "Preparing for the high-tech warfare of the future is a grand challenge. The emergence of autonomous cyber forces and agents and the complex ecosystem of Multi-Domain Operations create layers of sophistication and new opportunities for adversarial acts. Autonomous intelligent agents, a.k.a., bots, can be cyber-physical or just in the form of a program, but are almost always envisioned to outnumber the human forces. Future bots will be capable of gathering sensory data and other inputs on patterns and events and actively making decisions and playing deception games, while human agents will be working together with the bots to make critical decisions. To date, our understanding of the possible warfare scenarios involving bots, robust intelligence, as well as needed attack and defense strategies for human-bot activity is very limited. This MURI proposal, called AutoComBOT \u00d0 Autonomy in Cyberspace through rObot learning and Man-BOt Teaming, introduces a novel multi-pronged approach to address the standing challenges for future warfare involving multitude of cyber bots. Important constraints in bot warfare scenarios include limited access to a reliable central controller, speed of action, synchronization, and coordination among the distributed cyber-physical, cyber, and human entities. Our interdisciplinary team of US and Australian PIs will develop a new comprehensive foundational framework for safe and robust artificial intelligence intrinsic to autonomous agents, distributed bots, self-adaptivity, introspection, human-AI teaming, as well as automated methods for human-AI games, deception and recovery in dynamic settings. The focus of the AutoComBOT research is on three modular but inter-linked thrusts: 1) Robust Learning: We formulate key challenging scenarios in robust learning with distributed agents as instances of graph optimization problems; the formulation is leveraged to derive new bounds, metrics, attacks, and defenses. 2) Introspection/Anti-fragility Adaptation: This is formulated as active learning scenarios with offline preprocessing and training, online introspection/antifragility adaptation, and dynamic adversary deception. 3) New Team Science Concepts for Cyber Bots: This thrust focuses on effective team assembly, shared cognition for human-AI interaction, quantifying performances over time and tasks, robust team training by reinforcement learning, robustness to low-probability high-impact events, and self-adaptive mixed initiatives control and deception. The AutoComBOT results will significantly contribute to the efforts of the DoD/DST to prepare for future bot-involved warfare and ensure national security of the US, Australia, and our allies. The team will work closely with ARL and other DoD/DST labs in the US and Australia to realize this mission. To ensure a wide-scale adoption, we provide SW tools and APIs to make the algorithms robust and customizable with standard interfaces for ML packages. The thrusts will be evaluated and benchmarked on public data for multiple dynamic signal modalities, e.g., image, video, audio, text, and RF. AutoComBOT has an outstanding multidisciplinary team of diverse PIs; each PI brings in a strong set of relevant work/recent publications as well as novel ideas to the projectless",

John Kemp) propose to conduct the Canada Basin Acoustic Propagation Experiment (CANAPE), consisting of a yearlong experiment in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean during 2016\u20132017, preceded by a short Pilot Study during summer 2015, in order to understand the effects of changing Arctic conditions on low-frequency, deep-water propagation and on the low-frequency ambient noise field. We plan in 2016\u20132017 to combine measurements of acoustic propagation and ambient noise with the use of acoustic remote sensing methods to help characterize the large-scale sound-speed field in this difficult-to-measure region that is still ice covered during much of the year. The Arctic ocean tomography array proposed here for the 2016\u20132017 CANAPE Experiment is not unlike that deployed during 1988\u20131989 as part of the Greenland Sea Project. In that case the ocean acoustic tomography array was deployed in open water during summer 1988, became covered with ice during the winter, and was recovered in open water (barely) during summer 1989. The primary goal in the Greenland Sea Project was to characterize deep convection and deep water formation in the Greenland Sea during winter. The data were also used, however, to study ambient noise, acoustic scattering losses in the marginal ice zone, and the effects of the mixed layer on acoustic pulse propagation. One significant difference is that we were unable then to deploy the large vertical arrays made possible by the Distributed Vertical Line Array (DVLA) technology developed at SIO in order to help characterize deep water acoustic propagation. The goal of the CANAPE experiments is to determine the fundamental limits to signal processing in the Arctic imposed by ice and ocean processes. The hope is that these first few new steps will lead to a larger, permanent acoustic monitoring, navigation, and communications network in the Arctic Ocean.less",

Objectives include analysis of cross-shelf gradients of the surface wind forcing, submesoscale response of the inner shelf, and variations in the surface wave field. The proposed program will leverage an emerging network of HF radars deployed and operated by the Center for Oceanography (CFO) at the Vietnamese Administration for Seas and Islands (VASI).

Our Norwegian partner is the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) in Bergen, led by Hanne Sagen. The HiAATS experiment would take advantage of HiAOOS, the High Arctic Ocean Observation System program, a Horizon Europe funded EU project, that would provide access to the Arctic on a Norwegian Coast Guard icebreaker, the K/V Svalbard. NERSC will also provide substantial oceanographic instrumentation.This proposed experiment is designed to investigate the heat content and circulation of the Amundsen and Nansen Basins of the eastern Arctic Ocean. The acoustic propagation of low-frequency sound is very sensitive to small changes in water column temperature andstratification. By deploying three transceiver moorings and one receive-only mooring and measuring the travel-time of sound betweenthe moorings, one can infer the heat content and transport between the moorings. The moorings will be deployed to capture the acoustic signal of the incoming Atlantic Water which has been driving the environmental change observed in the Arctic. The acoustic observations include transmission loss, which depends in part on the ratio of first-year ice to older ice; and acoustic scattering, whichdiagnoses the strength of internal-wave activity. Finally, observations of the acoustic soundscape are also an important part of this program. Passive acoustic records in the Arctic are rare and incomplete. A large fraction of the recording budget will go towardsfurthering our understating of the environmental sound due to glacial and sea-ice activity, marine mammals, and other human activity, to name but a few of the many sources of sound in the ocean.Our goal is to explore the fundamental limits of acoustic signal processing and to exploit the remote sensing capabilities of acoustics to characterize the large-scale properties of the Arctic Ocean. The measurements of physical ocean and ice processes, and of the acoustic signal propagation and ambient noise obtained by this experiment will improve our ability to monitor, to communicate, and to navigate in the Arctic Ocean.

The outside world, however, has limited understanding of how this is taking place. Building upon an existing Minerva project examining the relationship between security and technology in China, this new three-year project seeks to both deepen and broaden our understanding of the nature, dynamics, and trajectory of this progress through a careful assessment of the structures, processes, and drivers, especially within the Chinese national and defense science, technology, and innovation systems. There are three key components of this project, with different objectives and methodological approaches: 1. China\u00d5s Defense Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) System: The first component examines how China\u00d5s defense establishment goes about conceiving, developing, producing, and procuring weapons systems, using an analytical framework that incorporates the different stages of the RDA process along with concepts from the field of innovation studies such as industrial innovation and national innovation systems. The project looks at the complex ecosystem of organizations and rules that are responsible for the conceptualization, design, engineering, testing, production, acquisition, and operation of weapons systems. This framework will be applied to several case studies. 2. Annual Review of China\u00d5s Defense Industrial Base: The second component provides a yearly review of the expansive Chinese defense industrial base, which offers a longitudinal perspective of the trends taking place in its grand transformation from imitator to innovator. Key areas of focus include the role of major actors (corporations, government and military agencies, research organizations), inputs (funding, technology transfers), processes (governance, decision-making, management of projects), and outputs (technologies). Research will also focus on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the defense industrial base at a systems level. The main analytical approach is the use of case studies that combine detailed descriptions offering rich empirical evidence and the use of an innovation capabilities framework that identifies and sorts key drivers of change and innovation into hard (tangible input factors) and soft (intangible, process-related factors) innovation categories. 3. Applying Lessons Learned from China to Understand How Other Countries Become Military Technological and Industrial Powers: Based upon findings from the study of China, the third component develops a generalizable framework that offers indicators and explanations as to why, how, and when other countries, especially those catching up, decide to develop indigenous or joint defense technological and industrial capabilities. Key factors include 1) top-level leadership support; 2) threat environment; 3) availability of high-quality scientific and technological talent; and 4) access to external technology and knowledge transfers. Case studies will be conducted on Russia, Israel, and India.less",

        "abstract": "Approved for Public ReleaseAbstractThe overarching goal of the proposed research program is to design synthetic membrane systems, to provide a platform for a self-reproducing artificial cell. Lipid membranes are required to organize cellular reactions and regul,ate the exchange of matter and energy with the environment. State-of-the-art approaches to mimic cell membranes in synthetic cells h,ave relied on using static lipid structures that are at thermodynamic equilibrium, formed from hydrating dried lipid films or using,microfluidic techniques. We currently do not understand the rules for reconstituting and maintaining lifelike lipid membranes that f,unction far from equilibrium. We will leverage our lab?s previous experience in designing biomimetic synthetic membranes, along with, a range of interdisciplinary approaches, to engineer the following fundamental functions in artificial cells: 1) Growth ? we will d,evelop revolutionary methods for sustained lipid synthesis in artificial cells and determine how lipid curvature affects membrane mo,rphology; 2) Division ? we will determine how growth can be coupled to controlled fission by optimizing membrane lipid compositions,and employing simple protein components that affect curvature; 3) Transport and Signaling ? given that artificial cells will requir,e mechanisms to import nutrients and respond to stimuli, we will design innovative strategies for transport and communication in art,ificial membranes; 4) Mesophase Transitions ? the plasma membrane is well-modeled by planar membranes; however, some organelles can,form dense 3-dimensional networks of lipids and proteins. We will examine whether non-lamellar lipid phases provide functional mimic,s of organelles that are capable of growth and division. Combining these approaches will result in an organizational framework for a,n artificial cell that is hierarchically organized and capable of self-reproduction. Understanding and utilizing reliable mechanisms, to produce artificial cells with synthetic lipid membranes could lead to the development of biomimetic materials with greater compl,exity and function than those currently available. The proposed studies could enhance our understanding of how to interface syntheti,c and biological systems and redefine what constitutes living matter. Ultimately, a substantial impact will be the ability to engine,er artificial cells, resulting in lifelike materials with the ability to grow, metabolize, and reproduce. Engineering dynamic artifi,cial cell membranes could lead to modular and programmable biomaterials with revolutionary applications in synthetic biology and mat,erials science research. Synthetic cells could have a substantial impact on biomanufacturing and sensing by moving past the limitati,ons imposed by existing biochemical systems.

The properties that will be incorporated into these solid state material are inspired by the behavior of biological materials which are part of important living data manipulation and storage systems. The specific properties that will be developed include; multiple states for fixed external conditions, sensitivity to external stimuli, threshold behavior for changing properties, fault tolerance, non-volatility, stochastic resonance, and low energy consumption for switching from one state to another. The basis for these materials will be strongly correlated electron systems, which exhibit first order phase transitions in transport, structural, or optical properties. In order to engineer these properties, mesoscaled hybrid heterostructures will be artificially synthesized, extensively characterized, and deeply studied. A particularly important ingredient is the study of these materials under a variety of conditions which can modify their properties: incorporation in unique hybrid structures, stimulated by electric fields, currents, temperature, strain, and noise. This type of materials will provide new functionalities non-existent yet in nature. Thus, they will provide a new class of materials, which will potentially become the basis for new high technology systems for electronics, sensors, data manipulation and storage. The PI\u2019s extensive experience and accomplishments in related areas form a solid basis over which to build such a program. The basic research to be performed in this project will develop new ideas and concepts for materials needed in data manipulation and storage systems. Additionally it will provide the training ground for the next generation of scientists and technologists, will familiarize university researchers with defense needs and provide direct service for DoD.less",

It is designed specifically to reduce the crucial thermal gradient problem in diode pumped high energy lasers. The development of gain materials with significantly higher k is consistent with the ONR and HEL-JTO~s mission to improve the power available HEL directed energy applications. Our strategy is to replace the traditional cubic oxides with a much higher conductivity Al2O3 and aluminum nitride (AlN). The potential performance gains are tremendous since our rare earth doped AlN ceramics will have thermal conductivities up to 30 times larger than the state of the art materials (e. g. Nd:YAG). We will concentrate on Er doping to produce lasing at 1.5 micrometers an eye-safer wavelength. We will ensure very low scattering losses by magnetically aligning thegrains in the ceramics. Additionally we will use non uniform rare earth doping (gradient ceramic) to further tune the thermal gradients and optical properties of the ceramics. Our processi\"ng technology is scalable and should be easily translatable to industry, leading to a reliable domestic supply of our technology.O\"ur team is comprised of researchers from UC San Diego and UC Berkeley.

Specifically, we will (i) introduce an oil core to the nanosponge formulation for dualmodal detoxification, (ii) combine toxin-degrading enzymes into nanosponge design for continuous detoxification, and (iii) genetically engineer the cell membrane to enhance the capacity and effectiveness of toxin neutralization. The work will also emphasize fundamental understandings on the structure-efficacy relationship in nanosponge design for better efficacy in vivo.

These include one for making the system operational from helicopters; another for adding on-board data processing and a satellite data link to a ground station for real-time data transmission; and, finally, a laser Doppler system for wind profiling between the aircraft and the surface.

This fieldwas inspired by the discovery of topological insulators, in which interfacial electrons transportwithout dissipation, even in the presence of impurities. Similarly, the use of carefully designedwavevector space topologies allows the creation of systems that support new states of light. WhileDirac cone is reminiscent of dispersion of electrons in graphene, it can now be use to tam photons,leading to new capabilities for photonic devices. Dirac cones can increase mode spacing by ordersof magnitude and thus allow for much larger area surface laser based on metamaterials. The largearea in turn leads to much higher output power compared to what has been possible so far. Thesesources will find applications in many DoD systems where high power is required. The researchwill 1) investigate the physics of high power metamaterial laser, 2) fabricate and characterize highpower metamaterial lasers and 3) realize electrically pumped high power metamaterial lasers.

        "abstract": "This project tackles the need to develop scalable computational methods for joint perception and planning that enable a team of agents to extract task???relevant information from massive, multi???modal data sources to support collaborative and distributed optimal planning with formal performanceguarantees. Future control and decision???making systems need to strike a balance between guaranteed performance in the presence of uncertainty, extraction of information relevant to the task at hand from streaming data, and reduced algorithmic complexity to enable real???time loop closure, re???planning, and learning. This confluence of control, estimation, machine learning, and computational science and engineering is necessary for high???confidence, high???reliability, minimal???supervision autonomous systems that can understand and act in high optempo missions. The proposed technical approach addresses head on the need to develop novel methods for extracting structure and understanding context from massive heterogeneous data in real time, ensuring safe operation in unstructured, dynamically changing conditions, and enabling extemporaneous multi???robot collaboration through compositional and hierarchical organization of knowledge. The synergistic research program is organized along five thrusts. Thrust 1 develops multi???modal representations forunified perception and action that can be used across different modalities and spatio???temporal scales; Thrust 2 develops methods for goal???oriented, task???aware perception, inference, and communication that account for the underlying control objective and the available informational and computationalresources across the team; Thrust 3 focuses on enabling resilience by quantifying uncertainty in the unified multi???modal representations, allowing for principled decisions on information exchange between team members, and developing methods to deal with the presence of adversarial agents; Thrust 4develops hierarchical architectures and compositional models that help solve planning, estimation, and coordination problems at the right level of granularity and, finally, Thrust 5 develops online distributed decision???making and inference methods capable of dealing with streaming multi???resolution data. The proposed research has the potential to redesign the landscape of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, acquisition and processing of military intelligence in future Naval missions. A successful outcome of this research will provide unprecedented modeling and inference capabilities to estimatequantities of interest for the Navy (such as the presence and location of potential threats, target tracking and intent recognition, perception and world modeling capabilities for autonomous system navigation and coordination) using heterogeneous streaming data from sensors (e.g., chemical, visual,inertial, wearables) and from cooperative and adversarial actors (e.g., frequency of communication, twitter feeds, contextual information). These capabilities are crucial for future Naval operations, where high???level situational awareness from massive streaming data needs to be obtained in real time and in adecentralized fashion. Moreover, the proposed research will provide fundamental theory and algorithms for distributed and hierarchical planning that will enable fast and distributed decision???making at mission optempo, capable of leveraging a hierarchy of multi???scale/multi???resolution world models toreduce the computational workload and enable operation on resource???constrained distributed embedded platforms.less",

In particular, this MURI focuses on two important size-dependent aspects of reactions in aqueous microdroplets \u2013 microdroplet surface physicochemical properties and diffusion within microdroplets. Using a new suite of experimental and computational methods and techniques to understand mechanisms of enhanced reactivity in aqueous microdroplets, a highly accomplished team of investigators has been assembled to tackle this problem. The team is uniquely qualified to investigate microdroplet surface properties, diffusion processes within microdroplets, chemical gradients in microdroplets and provide insights into how these key factors impact aqueous microdroplet reactivity. The MURI investigators have collectively and individually developed new experimental and computational methods and techniques to bring to bear on this fascinating chemistry. Two interrelated research thrust areas will be undertaken and include- - Research Thrust 1- Enhanced Chemical and Biological Activity within Microdroplets Evaluated using Different Measurement Modes. -Research Thrust 2- Measurements, Theory, and Modeling of the Physicochemical Properties of Microdroplets including Surface Composition, Surface Charge, Diffusion and Gradients. The overarching goal of this work is to provide the basis for a conceptual framework for understanding fundamental processes involved in novel reactivity in microdroplets so these unique reaction environments can be used in a variety of different ways including to promote chemical reactions, degrade environmental contaminants, and control the biological activity of virus-laden aerosols. A central goal is to develop the 'Rules of Microdroplet Reactivity' to provide a quantitative understanding of the role played by the surface activity of products and reactants, surface alignment of reactants at the interface, diffusion within the droplet, and how droplet curvature (size), and droplet charge impact these. Obtaining a more complete understanding of key issues, especially as it relates to microdroplet surface physicochemical properties, chemical gradients and diffusion within droplets, will enable the development of a clear conceptual framework. This will be achieved by carrying out studies using several experimental approaches to answer critical questions and hypotheses on the fundamental mechanisms that govern novel reactivity in aqueous microdroplets. These experiments will be supported by state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations of these complex enrvironments, all motivated by a desire to better understand the effects of these interesting and unique confined space systems on chemical reactivity and biological activity.less",

        "abstract": "Threat agents resulted from biochemical weaponry, combat wound infections, and venomous injuries impose significant threats upon U.S. military personnel. To reduce defense threats, vaccination against these threat agents continues to be a significant prophylaxis approach. However, conventional vaccine production relies largely on antigen denaturation to minimize toxicity, an approach that inevitably compromises critical antigenic information. Such tradeoff between safety and efficacy has dramatically hindered vaccine efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative vaccine strategies capable of launching potent and safe prophylaxis countermeasures. Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles can potentially address the drawbacks of existing vaccine development. In this strategy, synthetic nanoparticles are wrapped with membranes derived from natural cells such as red blood cells and white blood cells. Upon nanoparticle interaction, intact non-denatured toxins lose their motional freedom and are 'detained' by the membrane cloaked nanoparticles. The resulting nanoparticle-toxin complex (namely 'nanotoxoid') can sequester a diverse range of membrane-active toxins without altering their antigenic characteristics. The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop cell membrane-coated nanoparticles as a biomimetic nanotoxoid vaccine platform to launch effective prophylaxis medical countermeasures against various biological threat agents. As a platform prophylaxis technology, the design of biomimetic nanotoxoid vaccines combines engineering flexibility of synthetic materials and intricate antigenic characteristics of biological membranes, which together offer tremendous opportunities to modulate immunity against defense threats. These new nanotoxoid vaccines share a common core-shell nanostructure despite membrane and toxin diversity. Such unique combination in one design is especially suitable for a \"plug and play\" vaccine platform against multiple classes of threat agents.less",

The development of bulk phase diagrams and CALPHAD (calculation of phase diagrams) methods established the foundation for modern materials science, and interfacial phase diagrams (also called complexion diagrams) and their construction methods developed in the proposed project can have equally significant impacts. Bulk CALPHAD methods will be extended to model grain boundaries (GBs) and free surfaces. Experimental validation will be accomplished using advanced electron microscopy and measurement of interfacial transport properties. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be conducted to support thermodynamic modeling and to forecast GB cohesion/embrittlement. Moreover, ab initio and classical molecular dynamics (MD) will be carried out to forecast interfacial kinetics for use in predicting useful trends in sintering, grain growth, Coble creep, and ionic mobility. Using Mo-based alloys and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) as the (initial) model metallic and ceramic systems, respectively, computed GB diagrams will be used to forecast and control the fabrication and mechanical properties of advanced structural materials. An additional, transformative concept is to utilize 2-D interfacial phases to achieve superior properties unattainable by conventional bulk phases; battery materials will be used to demonstrate broader technological impacts (beyond structural materials). Interfacial phase diagrams and the methods to compute and use them \u2013 the key outputs of this research \u2013 will enable entirely new ways to tailor the processing and properties of many engineered materials for defense applications. Specifically, GB diagrams can be used for 1) optimizing fabrication pathways to utilize desired interfacial structures during processing to control microstructural evolution; 2) designing heat treatment recipes to adjust interfacial structures to improve mechanical or physical properties; and 3) forecasting interface-controlled, high-temperature material properties. In addition, analogous surface diagrams can be used to design spontaneously-formed \u201cdream coatings\u201d with self-regulating nanometer thicknesses.less",

The area of study, the Western Pacific between the 1st and 2nd island chains, is a region synoptically characterized by four major current systems (Kuroshio Current, Mindanao Current, North Equatorial Current, and North E quatorial Counter Current) and is known for strong meso and submesoscale variability. A complex submesoscale cascade is the result of a variety of processes including flow-topography interactions, typhoon and monsoon forcing, and instabilities of the major curren t systems that generate filaments, fronts, and eddies. Our proposed efforts will build off previous work in the region and will rel y on the deployment of persistent autonomous sampling platforms and the development of advanced autonomy behaviors to collect upper ocean physical oceanographic data in submesoscale features of interest, with objectives of increasing predictability. The proposed autonomous systems for use in this program include USVs (Liquid Robotics SV3 Wave Glider), UUVs (REMUS 600), and air-deployable expe ndable directional wave drifters (Scripps GPS-based Miniature Wave Buoy). Our effort will build off experience in both ONRs AUMA a nd FLEAT DRI programs. As in previous DRIs, we anticipate close collaboration with other observational groups, and numerical model ing teams to address issues of downscaling-model fidelity, parameterizations, and assimilation.

The array is rather sparse, with a nominal resolution of 5\"\"~X5~. Several ONR projects requires higher spatial resolution to address a variety of science questions. In the basic configuration,\" the Surface Velocity Program (SVP) drifter measures only SST and ocean currents at a depth of 15 m (i.e. the center-depth of the drogue). The SVP Barometer (SVPB) drifter has the same capability of the SVP drifter but it also carries a barometer to measure atmospheric sea level pressure. Innovating the Lagrangian drifter technology is a crucial part of maintaining an efficient and modern glob\"al array and to address science questions in regional experiments. With the proposed effort, we seek funds to develop new drifters b\"y expanding the computing power of the instrument and the range of hosted sensors. In support of the next generation Surface Velocit\"y Program drifter, the LDL proposes to design an ARM M7- architecture based embedded buoy controller with on-board Wi-Fi capabilitie\"s. We also propose the development of an in-house inductive communication system to replicate functionality of commercially available options. The new drifter board that will be developed with this effort will have a powerful enough processor and RAM to allow for onboard data reduction and the new developed inductive module will then be used to integrate chi-pods and drifting thermistor chain\"s.

Efficient implementation of these algorithms for persistent online learning in object identification and classification will be demonstrated on massively parallel neuromorphic hardware using streaming spike train data from event-driven vision and audition sensors, as well as standard and internal benchmark datasets of interest to Navy operations through a partnership with NIWC Pacific.

The synergistic research program isorganized along four thrusts. Thrust 1 focuses on hierarchical andresilient reasoning about dynamic environments at multiple temporaland spatial scales informed by metric and semantic information. Thrust2 develops integrated hierarchical perception and planning to supportdecision-making at multiple levels of spatial, semantic, and temporalabstraction, providing the foundation to tacklecommunication-dependent multi-agent scenarios. Thrust 3 buildssituational awareness and hierarchical abstractions from streamingdata for multi-agent teams to enable operation in a distributedfashion. Thrust 4 complements the distributed perception techniques inThrust 3 by focusing on the design of scalable distributed algorithmsfor multi-agent planning and optimal control under communication,dynamics, and perceptual constraints.The proposed research will significantly enhance the Navy'scapabilities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)missions by advancing tractable computational methods for flexible andresilient learning, sharing, and reasoning. Our approach will enableenvironment representations for multi-agent situational awareness aswell as autonomous execution of complex multi-agent missions. RAPIDwill endow agents with the capabilities to build compactmetric-semantic models that integrate localized and dynamic perceptioninformation into a representation that can be shared with otheragents. This will enable robotic teams to attain a comprehensive,global, and accurate understanding of the environment, and to plancollaboratively with other agents within a unified theoreticalframework that does not require ad hoc decomposition or restrictiveassumptions on the separation of perception and planning. The projectwill establish fundamental theory and algorithms for reasoning aboutdynamic scenes, managing the impact of uncertainty in decision-makingand planning, leveraging multi-source, multi-scale perception andhierarchical planning for fast anddistributed decision-making atmission op-tempo, and resilient operation and deployment outside theoriginal training domain.This abstract is approved for public release.less",

This research leverages hardware previously developed by Metis Design Corporation (MDC), including distributed digitization hardware, piezoelectric-based damage-localization sensors, and a data accumulation hub. Collaborating with UCSD, there were three main thrusts for the Phase I research: sensor placement optimization using a Bayesian risk minimization approach, guided wave-based algorithm development using a hybrid phase coherent/incoherent approach, and data visualization using a sonar-image reconstruction approach. This Phase I culminated in a blind demonstration of the technology on a large aluminum plate, detecting and illustrating multiple damage locations introduced by Navy staff. This Phase II effort will seek to mature this approach to be suitable for deployment on multiple naval platforms. The initial task will focus on compensation for environmental and operational loading conditions. The second task will focus on developing robust generic tools that could be used for SHM system design, algorithm calibration and visualization customization. The final task option will provide validation for these tools including the compensation elements on large-scale components in the laboratory and then in a relevant environment. At the completion of the program, this SHM system will be available for navy fleet deployment.less",

We propose to procure a suite of equipment that will provide for accurate seabed navigation of deployed robotic assets, provide for safe and rapid launch and recoveries in challenging sea states, and provide for high resolution imaging of the seafloor. The equipment consists of an integrated navigation system to allow for the broadcast of precise navigation solutions to both unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Comprised of a surface deployed ultra-short baseline (USBL) navigation system integrated with a GPS inertial navigation system, the system will both determine locations of seabed survey assets equipped with anacoustic beacon, and communicate that information to thedeployed asset. We will also procure a tether management system (TMS) to extend the range of a recently procured Saab Remotely Operated Vehicle (Saab Cougar) to a depth of 2000 m. The extended range capability of the ROV will align it with a broader set of emerging deepwater science questions and provide capability to team with deeper rated UUVs. The system will also include an integrated launch and recovery system (LARS) that will provide for safe, all-weather launch and recoveries of the ROV. A UUV-based optical imagingsystem will support seabed projects and advance our interpretation of seabed sidescan surveys. Data from the system will support structure-from-motion data analysis to provide high resolution local navigation solutions, as well as the development of digital elevation models at cm scales through use of parallel processed photogrammetric image reconstruction.

The end goal of both efforts is to conduct resear ch on improving the Navys ocean prediction models and of acoustic propagation predictions. Therefore, there is a pressing need foro bservations that cover large areas expeditiously and measure critical surface properties of the ocean that reflect its thermohaline structure and its variability. Autonomous drifting buoys are proven tools that have been used for decades to collect observations i n remote areas that require sustained sampling and are hard to reach due to logistic constraints or because of severe weather occurr ences that prevent the deployment of more traditional shipborne sampling methods.The Lagrangian Drifting Laboratory of the Scripps I nstitution of Oceanography (SIO) is the leading center for conducting scientific research with Lagrangian drifters and for the desig n of innovative, fit-for-purpose autonomous drifting instruments.This proposal seeks support to fabricate a fleet of specialized dri fters capable of sensing fundamental physical variables at the air-sea interface to address the problem at hand, including near-surf ace currents, sea surface temperature, waves, wind, rain, atmospheric pressure and salinity, concurrently with recording of ambientn oise. Such autonomous drifting instruments will form a network of sensors that will use machine learning algorithms specifically tra ined to optimize unmanned collection of critical data.Building on our successful approach used in several recent ONR funded projects . in which arrays of wave gliders, sea gliders and drifters were operated remotely, an SV3 wave glider by Liquid Robotics will be im bedded in the proposed arrays of autonomous drifters to collect additional important meteorological (wind, air pressure, air relativ e humidity) and oceanographic (subsurface temperature and salinity, currents) observations.Abstract is Publicly Releasable.less",

        "abstract": "The circulation across oceanic fronts has been a topic of study for decades. The strain that causes fronts necessarily results in a cascade from mesoscales of the size of oceanic eddies down to sub-mesoscales of 1 kilometer size and smaller. In particular, the three-dimensional flow at these small scales may be intense. These flow are difficult to observe because of they are so small, intense, and intermittent. Here, we propose an observational plan using underwater gliders to address the following goals:??? to quantify mesoscale vertical velocity using survey data and diagnostic approaches??? to resolve submesoscale three-dimensional flow through direct measurement??? to observe internal wave vertical displacements around a frontWe propose to use Spray underwater gliders to observe these processes. Gliders will be used first to survey in a coordinated fashion. We plan to contribute six underwater gliders to a collaborative fleet that may be as large as 15 gliders. In survey mode, the 15 gliders would cover the same track length per unit time as a ship surveying with a towed vehicle. Deployments will last 100 days profiling to 1000 m, and gliders will carry sensors to measure temperature, salinity, velocity and chlorophyll fluorescence. Second, we propose to take advantage of our ability to park a Spray on an isopycnal in the region of a front, and measure vertical velocity through changes in pressure. We propose to use 3 gliders in this way, to produce a maximum of about 50three-day drifts. A proposed technical development is to equip the gliders with acoustic tracking equipment to realize complete 3-dimensional flow during the drifts.A timeline is as follows. Year 1 will include a pilot experiment in the Alboran Sea usingone glider and the development required to integrate acoustic navigation onto Spray gliders. Year 2 will include the remainder of acoustic integration, and intensive sampling using six gliders. A second intensive experiment will take place during year 3, again using six gliders. Years 4-5 will focus on analysis, and presentation and publication of resultsless",

Such accurate modeling requires the solution of the wave equation in the ocean containing scatterers. In the absence of the scatterer, the oceanic waveguide can be assumed to be axially symmetric. This allows certain types of physically valid approximations to be made, which are 2D in nature, but can accurately compute the acoustic field in a 3D ocean. The presence of the scatterer breaks this symmetry and forces one to model the ocean as fully 3D. Due the large size of the computational domain, the solution of the wave equation in an oceanic waveguide in the presence of scatterers is a daunting numerical task. In Phase I of this STTR we developed finite element models in the frequency and time domains to compute the acoustic field in a 2D, elastic, range-dependent waveguide in the presence of an elastic object. The objective of this Phase II effort is to develop the numerical capability to accurately solve the wave equation in a range-dependent elastic waveguide in the presence of a general, 3D elastic target to ranges of at least 10,000 acoustic wavelengths. To cope with the numerical complexities in 3D, we plan to accomplish this objective by developing numerical tools that implement a hybrid model composed of finite element and propagation models.less",

This proposal will capitalize on the rapidly maturing m\"icro-sensor, computer, and wireless telecommunication technologies to develop a robust, integrated approach for measuring physical p\"arameters to assist in understanding the physical oceanographic processes in the western Indian Ocean. Low-level atmospheric circulation over the Indian Ocean has two dominant manifestations: a southwest monsoon during the summer period (June ~ September) and a northeast monsoon during the winter period (December ~ March). The influence that the monsoonal flow has on the Indian Ocean is seen in the reversal of the ocean surface circulation with a striking reversal observed in the Somali Current . Time series data from in situ sensors will be collected over multiple seasonal monsoonal cycles to aid in our investigation of the linkages among the regional\" currents and the larger basin circulation. Specifically, this investigation~s long term objectives are: Investigate the continuity\" of the Somali Current and systems and linkages to other regional currents and the interior of the Arabian Sea.Investigate the large scale features and the feedback mechanisms that affect the predictability of the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea Circulation Measure the growth of surface waves in the context of wave-current interactions during monsoonal forcing of the Somali Current.Assess new in situ and remote sensor technologies and their communication protocols Integrate the sensor networks to facilitate data acquisition/fusion.

        "abstract": "Marine mammals, particularly endangered baleen whales and beaked whales are of concern to the US Navy in regard to noise impacts during naval training exercises. To quantify and mitigate the impact of noise on marine mammals, it is essential to understand the influence of the physical marine environment on the distributions of marine mammals and their prey. The aim of this proposed work is to compare foraging and diving behavior of blue, fin and beaked whales at a sonar-impacted and a minimally disturbed site within the Southern California Bight, using data on oceanography, prey, cetaceans and mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS). Marine mammals inhabit a highly dynamic, mobile environment. Unlike terrestrial or benthic habitats, pelagic habitats are influenced by fluid dynamical features that change position and structure over time. This presents a challenge for management and conservation. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) Local physical oceanographic conditions drive small-scale epi-, meso-, and bathypelagic prey distributions. (2) Marine mammals with a focus on blue, fin, and Cuviers beaked whales sense and target dense aggregations of prey and adapt their foraging behavior to changing prey conditions. (3) Use of MFAS during US Navy training operations will invoke a behavioral response, in the form of quantifiable change in marine mammal acoustic and dive behavior. (4) The behavioral response will be dependent on the underlying prey conditions and the current behavioral state of the individual. An experiment will be conducted to record multi-channel passive acoustic data at a sonar-impacted and a minimally disturbed site to identify tracks of calling blue and fin whales, and track fine-scale dive behavior of Cuviers beaked whales during foraging, respectively. Information on pelagic prey will be collected with autonomous activeacoustic systems. Physical oceanographic features will be measured with autonomous conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and oxygen sensors. Blue, fin and Cuviers beaked whale tracks will be computed across the 2-year data set based on their B, D, 20 Hz and 40 Hz calls, and echolocation clicks, respectively. MFAS occurrence will be documented. Active acoustic backscatter strength of taxonomic groups will be integrated across relevant depth bins. Physical oceanographic properties will be computed across those depth bins. A statistical framework will be developed to test relationships. Dynamic ecosystem-based management and impact mitigation requires a holistic view of the pelagic ecosystem, with an understanding of not only organismal behavior but also of the underlying physics. This work will provide insight into the physical drivers of nekton distribution from surface waters to the bathypelagic and the subsequent marine mammal response at a sonar-impacted and minimally disturbed site in comparison.less",

Deterrence theory advocates bold words or actions intended to inhibit escalation; the spiral model discourages these same behaviors, fearing they can produce a security dilemma. Contradictory forecasts are unhelpful for policy; which prescriptions should one follow? Both perspectives have also failed to evolve with new thinking about the nature of conflict. Nations appear to fight for reasons that differ from those assumed by either deterrence theory or the spiral model. Resolving this disconnect is crucial to anticipate crisis dynamics. This project aims to answer the central question of How can one explain and predict actions during an international crisis?Proposed Methods: Phase 1: Data Processing~overcoming the ongoing intellectual impasse by applying ~big data~ techniques to create an empirical model of crisis dynamics. The smaller steps in this process include intercoder aggregation, event taxonomy, and measuring temporal distortion. Phase 2: Data Analysis~led by Drs. Douglass and Scherer, supervised by Professor Gartzke and will be conducted by cPASS~s affiliated graduate and undergraduate students. The smaller steps in this process include data preparation, selecting the appropriate function form, interpreting out of sample accuracy, interpreting residuals, interpreting covariate importance, interpreting covariate effects, and repeat. Phase 3: Theory Refinement~critically assess the existing canonical theories and propose refinements and extensions of theory in light of what is discovered in the analysis conducted in Phase 2.Anticipated Outcomes: The project aims to produce an improved International Crisis Behavior dataset, a probabilistic decision tree, the ability to identify the most appropriate historical analogies, and a theory of crisis dynamics which will allow for the prediction of outcomes from different types of actions in crises in combination with the probabilistic decision tree.Impact on DoD/Broader Implications for National Defense: The anticipated Theory of Crisis Dynamics will help policy makers by resolving the intellectual logjam between deterrence theory and the spiral model. Decision makers will be able to apply the theory to the immediate situations they face, scenarios they plan for, and future evolutions of foreign and defense policy.less",

A fleet of six Spray underwater gliders will be used for two overarching purposes: (1) to quantify observable metrics of submesoscale circulation including vorticity and vertical veloc ity, and (2) to participate in observing/modeling system with iSOAP collaborators. We propose to conduct intensive experiments in tw o consecutive years, with the six glider fleet deployed for 3-4 months during each year. Two modes of glider behavior will be used t owards the end of resolving submesoscale processes. First, we will deploy the six glider in parallel lanes separated by 20 km to uni formly cover a region 100 km by 100 km in the horizontal and 1000 m deep inthe vertical. Second, we will assign gliders to follow de nsity surfaces in the region of strong submesoscale variability with the goal of directly measuring the vertical velocity. We envis ion full participation in the iSOAP observing/modeling system including (1) the identification of relevant physical processes and me trics, (2) the establishment of observing requirements and assimilation approaches, (3) the performance of adaptable surveys during observing/modeling intensive periods, and (4) the assessment of results of the system of observations and models. In summary, succes s in this project will be measured by the achievement of both technical and scientific goals.Technical goals:Demonstration of coordi nated submesoscale surveys of fleets of underwater gliders.Development of improved techniques for underwater gliders to follow subsu rface layers.Scientific goals:Quantification of submesoscale diagnostics like vorticity and vertical velocityQuantification of subme soscale three-dimensional flow through direct measurement of glider displacement in neutrally buoyant drift mode.Improved prediction through adaptive autonomous glider surveys.less",

        "abstract": "The international community faces a growing set of rapidly evolving, dauntingly complex political challenges related to economic interdependence and security. A revisionist Russia has unilaterally redrawn the borders of Europe, and increasingly seeks to confront the United States and its allies in nontraditional domains. Meanwhile, the economic and military rise of China threatens to reshape the global order for the first time in decades. These dynamics and others suggest a return to traditional Great Power competition. However, they are also occurring in a historically novel context. Unprecedented levels of economic interdependence and the impractical nature of major war among nuclear powers stand as twin pillars discouraging some types of aggression, while enabling others. Economic interdependence makes military conflict between great powers more costly at the same time that it facilitates novel forms of economic coercion, ranging from the raising of tariffs and embargoing of strategic resources, to blacklisting technology firms with close relationships to governments (Huawei) and targeting state and non-state actors through their dependence on financial networks (Al Qaeda, Iran). Interdependence generated by the revolutions in information technology have also simultaneously produced tremendous economic efficiencies and rising vulnerabilities to new forms of aggression (backdoors in telecommunications infrastructure, ransomware attacks on municipal governments, election interference, corporate espionage). Keeping these complex interdependencies and their potential for conflict in mind, we seek to answer the following questions- 1. How do competition and conflict function in the presence of dense economic ties? 2. How can the U.S. best use economic power to achieve its national interests while avoiding armed conflict? 3. Under what conditions is economic coercion most effective? The complexity of economic interdependence ensures contrasting consequences in different contexts. While interdependence reduces the economic incentives of states to conquer their neighbors\u2019 territory outright, it may increase incentives for nations to demand changes to a neighbor\u2019s policies or politics, including antitrust and non-competitive behavior. Trade and foreign investment allow states to gain a great deal of wealth from their neighbors without conquering them. Conversely, it is precisely because the United States is so interdependent with other nations that US leaders have such a strong interest in Chinese industrial policy, monetary policy, antitrust regulations, intellectual property rights, and Chinese relationships with other nations.less",

There is a need to isolate and concentrate phages collected from the field to enhance specimen storage stability for long-distance transport to specialized laboratories for subsequent analysis. Environmental phage preparation requires expensive, bulky instrumentation and intensive manual procedures. In order to streamline the processes for rapid phage enrichment, screening and isolation in the field, we propose to develop a portable system, comprising of microfluidic processing technology for environmental phage preparation. During Phase I, we developed a modular phage sample preparation system which was interconnected with inline microfluidic devices for efficient filtration. We breadboard tested the phage preparation workflow using various simulated environmental samples in the lab. Phase II research will focus on building a miniaturized and ruggedized system for targeted phage propagation and screening. We will extensively test this integrated phage preparation system with environmental samples from the field. Phase III will focus on alpha and beta prototype manufacturing, commercialization and technology validation with the DoD team. Our portable phage preparation of field suspension samples will provide a novel capability in wide usage of both military and civilian applications.less",

The proposed observational techniques include X-band radar, data from an existing array of HF radar, and in-situ observations including drifting wave buoys and miniature meteorological buoys. The dense set of observations provided by the DRI participants will provide a landmark dataset for the development and testing of land-based remote sensing techniques which can provide observations in time and space, and provide benchmarks for testing high resolution, dynamical ocean models.less",

To enhance the spatial coverage in the horizontal, OAT has been augmented with shipboard receivers to cover larger areas. Nonetheless, its routine usage still is not reality today, especially in shallow water, except for the ocean currents based on reciprocal acoustic transmissions. The major challenge is the requirement for rather expensive acoustic moorings to be maintained and operated simultaneously, along with precise knowledge of relative source/receiver locations all the time and accurate synchronization. In this work, wepropose using a ship radiating broadband noise as a surrogate for a probe source (PS), referred to as moving ship tomography. This is facilitated by blind deconvolution, which provides Green#s functions between vertical receive arrays and the PS of unknown sourcewaveforms. In addition, we will exploit both relative travel times and angles of multipath arrivals observed by vertical receive arrays. Separately, the array tilt due to ocean currents can be estimated by the waveguide invariant while a ship circling around vertical arrays, revealing information about the currents. The proof of concept will be verified by both simulations and previous experimental data collected in shallow water. This abstract is publicly releasableless",

Vertical velocity (w) is of order 10 m day????1 and transports properties across the mixed layer base. However, this w is challenging to observe amidst an ambient internal wavefield with w variability of order 1 cm s????1. Moreover, the submesoscale evolves over scales <1 day and <10 km. Therefore, high spatial and temporal resolution are needed. This project will use a combination of rapid spatial surveys from a ship and a rapidlyprofiling float array to assess w at an intense front across a range of scales: at mesoscale from the spatial surveys using quasigeostrophic approximations, such as the omega equation, _ in submesoscale streamers by tracking tracers (such as chlorophyll, salinity, spice, and potential vorticity) with finer spatial surveys and a float array, and _ due to internal waves from each float???s high-frequency w fluctuations. Repeated meso- and submesoscale-resolving surveys in the upper 200 m with Underway CTD (UCTD) and/or SeaSoar will follow an array of up to 8 SOLO-II floats at a mesoscale front and submesoscale streamers on its flanks during 3 cruises. A feature will be identified in an initial mesoscale UCTD or SeaSoar survey, a forecast model, and near-realtime satellite products, e.g., sea surface temperature and chlorophyll. The float array will be deployed in a submesoscale streamer in a box pattern and recovered after several days. Each float profiles to 200 m every 100 minutes and obtains about 400 profiles over a 30-day cruise. The submesoscale UCTD survey will follow the float array at the front. Cross-front sections of about 20-km length will be completed every 6 hours. Along each section, temperature and salinity profiles will be obtained at a horizontal resolution of about 250 m every 4 minutes. The whole suite of observations (mesoscale survey, float array, and submesoscale survey) will be relocated and repeated.This project will demonstrate the capability of an array of floats to gather dense hydrographic data to: (a) better understand of the transport of tracers and drifting objects due to the vigorous meso- and submesoscale circulation on the peripheries of eddies and fronts and (b) to improve local predictions.less",

Goals of the project will be to observe variations in circulation as controlled by winds, tides, waves, and remote forcing. Particular interest will focus on cross-shelf gradients of the surface wind forcing, submesoscale response of the inner shelf, and variations in the surface wave field. The proposed program will leverage an emerging network of HF radars deployed and operated by the Center for Oceanography (CFO) at the Vietnamese Administration for Seas and Islands (VASI). The program will establish a scientific dialogue with CFO/VASI scientists, and provide instruction to host-country scientists in operating and maintaining HF radar, and the assessment and scientific synthesis of ocean currents from their network. The partnership program will also include other U.S. scientists in an ocean observation and numerical study of the coastal circulation in the Gulf of Tonkin. Data from the HF radar will be used for connectivity studies and provide benchmarks for testing high resolution, dynamical ocean models.less",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, oceanographic research has relied upon the use of ships at sea for sampling as well as instrument deployment and recovery. The numbers of oceanographic ships have grown and the sophistication of hardware has increased with time. Over the past twenty years, the availability of geosynchronous satellites has provided a means for communications to the US academic fleet. The larger ships in the research fleet have been planned, funded and built by the US Navy. As with combat ships, the costs of construction and operation (largely funded by the NSF) have increased steadily and to the point where reductions in numbers and size are inevitable. Our proposal builds upon work we have done in introducing autonomous vehicles that draw upon wave energy for propulsion, solar power for instrumentation and acoustic modems for transferring data to and from deep seafloor sensor packages. This surface ~gateway~ connects to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Iridium satellites for transferring data to our laboratory ashore and thence to an open repositories for scientific community access. The costs for construction and operating autonomous vehicles is substantially less expensive than using research vessels. There remain many scientific problems that will continue to draw on the use of ships, but to constrain costs, we must turn more-and-more to autonomous systems.During the past two years, we acquired two first-generation ~wave gliders~ for developing an ocean gateway to the global Internet. We successfully conducted a three-month deployment in deep water beyond San Clemente with continuous streaming of data from the seafloor to a glider holding station in a pattern above the seafloor instrumentation. In this case, we deployed a broadband seismometer and pressure gauge (broadband hydrophone) at the seafloor and transmitted data to the surface with an acoustic modem developed at Woods Hole and funded by ONR. The average latency for transferring this data from the seafloor to the lab was approximately 4.3 minutes. Much of the latency was due to accessing the spacecraft. While on station using GPS, we were able to track the glider effectively and the glider, in turn held station near the seafloor seismic package. At one point a storm offshore drove the waveglider south and out of touch of the seafloor package. As the storm abated, the glider (with a top speed of 1.5 ~ 2 knots) worked its way north, acquired a signal from the bottom package, and continued to transfer data.In addition to this work, we also built a hydrodynamic ~tow-body~ capable of being transported by the wave glider. The idea is to use this mechanism to tow a seafloor package to a drop point rather than using an expensive ship for deployment. In this proposal we seek funds to purchase two new wave gliders that provide more powerfrom solar cells and feature a collapsible propeller for maneuvering when waves disappear or when currents are high enough to drive the glider off station. In addition, we are requesting funding to construct a seafloor package suitable for operation for at least two years including sufficient power to download full bandwidth data (50Hz) for at least 20 days. We will purchase two flat panel arrays for communication with small sats in LEO or Mid Earth Orbit (MEO) for downloading data at much higher rates and lower cost. These will be tested aboard a small oceanographic ship with downloads to one of the panels on the San Diego Supercomputer Center~s rooftop where our current Atlantic and Pacific antennae are mounted. The two wave gliders will be modified for operation with smaller antenna arrays to allow telemetry with the glider and the acoustic connection to the seafloor package.This new data gateway oceanographic system will revolutionize long-term measurements at sea by reducing ship use and enhancing the rates at which information is delivered to scientists and any interested user.less",

Passive noise correlation processing of distributed random noise has been successfully used to estimate the time-domain Green's function between two spatially separated receivers. However, the requirements for a long recording time, uniformity in the spatial distribution of sources as well as accurate synchronization made the approach impractical. An alternative way to measure the Green~s function between two points is to use secondary sources based on the time reversal mirror. By reversing the role of sources and receivers,we will explore the potential of using two separated ships along with a vertical receiver array to extract the Green~s functions between them. Our approach involves blind deconvolution to instantly extract the Green~s function from each of the ships, and then adopts the virtual receiver (VR) concept similar to the guide star in radio astronomy to estimate the Green~s functions between them. Further, using the waveguide invariant theory, a virtual horizontal array (guide sources) can be generated around the guide source at a closer range, whose every single element can turn into a VR for the distant target ship. The proof of concept will be verified by simulations and experimental data collected in shallow water.less",

        "abstract": "A century of study has not been able to identify the causal mechanism of decompression sickness (DCS). We propose a new quantitative method to study Nitrogen gas (N2) in mammals. Decompression sickness is currently hypothesized to be caused by bubble formation in tissues. However, due to the lack of direct methods to track tissue gas, the field has used indirect methods such as ultrasound of venous gas emboli (VGE) in the heart and mathematical modelling based on empirical testing in human divers. Current methods topredict DCS are based on statistical probability with relative risk factors such as depth and duration. It has not yet been possible to determine the causal mechanisms and explain the intra- and interindividual variability present in DCS, suggesting that a direct method to map tissue gas distribution is a priority, as it has the potential to refine risk assessment and contribute to optimizing diving profiles.We will use a radioactive, positron-emitting isotope of Nitrogen (13N2) that can be breathed in a hyperbaric chamber and monitored in time and space using positron-emission tomography (PET) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With 13N2, we can quantitatively measure the Nitrogen distribution in the body. 13N2 has previously been produced and used in normobaric experiments with human volunteers, and a hyperbaric chamber can be constructed to inhale the gas during compression (simulated diving), widening applicability to hyperbaric breathing. We hypothesize that tissue gas bubbles will create bright spots while gas in solution will generate a signal equivalent to that tissues saturation with Nitrogen. This new method would allow to answer the gas localization question, and address the impact of preconditioning on the amount of venous gas emboli after decompression. This approach will open a window to study basic mechanisms and impact of interventions related to DCS in both animals and humans.less",

        "abstract": "In this project, funded through the PECASE mechanism, the overarching goal of the proposed research is to build quantitative and predictive computational models of microparticle formation. This research will be carried under three specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on the role of membrane mechanics and lipid asymmetry in the formation of microparticles. Our approaches in this aim include coarse-grained simulations of lipid bilayers accounting for the composition heterogeneity and continuum mechanics approaches for membrane curvature generation and bending during microparticle formation. Both these efforts together will result in a multiscale model for the role of membranes in microparticle formation. Aim 2 will focus on the development of mathematical and computational models that investigate how actin and plasma membrane interactions modulate the mechanics of microvesicle formation under hyperbaric pressure. It is well-established that cells experienceincreased oxygen toxicity and oxidative stress under conditions of hyperbaric pressure and release microvesicles. However, how hyperbaric pressure affects the mechanics of the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton to promote the formation and release of microvesicles remains poorly understood. The development of mathematical and computational models that can predict how mechanical forces, coupled with biochemical effects can promote microvesicle formation will be a crucial aspect for gaining a quantitative understanding of these fundamental cellular processes. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on alterations tomitochondrial mechanics under hyperbaric pressure. Mitochondria perform a variety of key biological processes, including regulation of ion gradients, membrane potential, ROS generation, and heat dissipation. A recent experimental study by Dr. David Eckmanns group has shown that under simulated dive conditions, fibroblasts showed altered mitochondrial respirationrates, mitochondrial motility, and alterations to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell shape. This is one of the first controlled observations of the effect of hyperbaric pressure and the dive conditions on cellular energetics. These preliminary observations point to the fact that conditions associated with high pressure alter cellular mechanics and mitochondrial function. In this portion of the project, I will develop mathematical and computational models to probe how mechanics interfaces with cellular respiration to regulate the energy demands of cells under various dive conditions.less",

        "abstract": "The goal of the proposed research is to develop new analytical and algorithmic tools to enhance the capabilities of modern sensor arrays for extracting information from spatio-temporal signatures of impinging electromagnetic waves. Sensor arrays are widely used in a large number of imaging, sensing, and tracking applications, and their performance depends on a number ofphysical factors such as array geometry, aperture, statistical properties of the source scene, noise power, and so forth. A deeper understanding of how these factors interplay towards characterizing fundamental performance limits of modern sensing systems, will allow the development of more powerful, robust and computationally efficient algorithms. Recent advances in sampler design for sensor arrays have produced new insights into how nonuniform array geometry can play a critical role in overcoming long-standing bottlenecks in sourcelocalization. However, the superior performance of these arrays is typically achieved at the cost of using larger number of temporal snapshots. Since practical sensing systems often operate in a limited-sample regime, it is crucial to understand finite sample behavior of these arrays, anddevelop robust algorithms that can overcome possible performance degradations. This project will integrate novel ideas from optimization, random matrix theory and signal representation to analyze performance limits of non-uniform sensor arrays in presence of limited data, and when the number of sources to be localized can potentially exceed the number of sensors. In the latter scenario, it becomes essential to use non-uniform geometry. Our results will pave the way for design of computationally efficient robust algorithms with improved performance guarantees. Our research outcomes will positively impact many applications of sensing and imaging, ranging from radar, sonar to medical imaging. Moreover, the mathematical and computational frameworks go beyond specific applications and can lead to development of new optimization tools and analysis techniques.less",

        "abstract": "Objectives: The overall objective of this project is to develop a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on symmetry: an integrated approach that combines first-principles with data for learning complex spatiotemporal dynamics. There are two major challenges that we propose to tackle: - Challenge 1: Accommodating imperfect symmetries in real-world dynamics: We propose to design novel approaches that can exploit symmetry as an inductive bias to improve learning. Unlike previous works that assume perfect symmetry, we will work with more realistic settings that allow weak forms of symmetry constraints including partial symmetry, approximate symmetry, and probabilistic symmetry. We will develop equivariant neural networks without stringent symmetry constraints using techniques such as symmetry disentanglement and relaxed weight-sharing. - Challenge 2: Discovering unknown symmetries from spatiotemporal data: Given rich spatiotemporal sensing data with unknown symmetries, we will develop DL frameworks that can automatically discover symmetry inductive biases from the data. Specifically, we will investigate adversarial training algorithms to discover the invariant sets from dynamical systems, Lie algebra convolutional networks to discover symmetry groups, as well as sparse regularization techniques to discover the intrinsic dimensions for efficient representation. We will work with video and trajectory data from cameras, LiDar and navigational devices, using our symmetry-aware DL models as basic building blocks for dynamics learning and decision-making. We will demonstrate the practical values of our framework to solve challenging tasks including trajectory forecasting, motion planning, surrogate modeling and video prediction. Intellectual Merit: Introducing physical constraints into data-driven machine learning is central to enable next generation AI methods that are adaptive, efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy. While most DL methods are designed for static images or discrete texts with little or no physics, our framework will lead to DL innovations for sensing data that are dynamic and continuous, and are governed by physical processes, transforming vast spatiotemporal data into actionable insights in real time. Our work contributes to the emerging field of physics-guided AI, and focuses on the fundamental concept of symmetry. Symmetry as an inductive bias are essential to the success of deep learning. Our method would improve learning performance without stringent constraints. By expanding to imperfect and unknown symmetries, our framework would significantly improve the applicability of symmetry-aware DL to the real world. Moreover, our tools can also discover unknown symmetries from the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of engineering and science problems. Broader Impact: As motivating applications, this research will lead to novel DL approaches that can emulate turbulent flow much faster than the traditional numerical solvers; trajectory and motion forecasting algorithms that are robust and sample efficient; and physically meaningful video prediction models for diverse scenarios. Ultimately, our framework would enable a new generation of AI methods that can efficiently learn, reason, act and adapt in complex, multi-modal, highly dynamic environments. It would contribute to the fundamental knowledge of AI in understanding and reasoning in the spatiotemporal environment, significantly enhancing our ability to derive knowledge from real-time sensing data and strengthening future army capabilities and systems.less",

Phase I has already demonstrated proof-of-principle hardware. The primary Phase II objective is to successfully carry out a human subjects study, at the San Diego VA, that samples circadian-related biochemical rhythms (cortisol, melatonin, neurotransmitter levels) with simultaneously acquired physiological sensor data (EEG, GSR, temperature, PPG/HR/HRV/SpO2, motion and ambient light/sound) to determine correlates between circadian activity and physiological measurements as well as abnormalities that are associated with PTSD. Supporting the study, our second Phase II objective is to continue advancing the Phase I hardware prototype into a pre-production model that meets the signal quality, wearability and durability requirements for multi-day acquisition. This sets the stage for subsequent efforts to conduct expanded studies, develop automated analysis algorithms, and clinical intervention protocols with the ultimate goal of a closed-loop PTSD diagnosis and intervention product.less",

Atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer structures are the result of coupled dynamics between the atmosphere, ocean and surface gravity wave field. As a result, air-sea fluxes are modulated by surface gravity waves and small-scale features on either side of the interface couple driving boundary layer variability. Few observations capturing these transient features exist leading to limitations in our dynamical understanding of these processes in addition to deficient parameterizations in numerical models. This proposal describes a novel way of sampling rapidly evolving structures in atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers using remote-sensing to detect surface roughness variability and queuing fast autonomous vehicles for targeted sampling. The work will focus on the development of an autonomous, rapid marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) profiling capability using a UAV taking off and landing from a USV. This collaborative sampling technique overlaps with ONR-sponsored robotics competitions such as Maritime RobotX Challenge 2022 such that the proposed technology can have dual-use functionality for education and scientific research.

Some of these variations reflect mesoscale vari-ability of confluent water masses, which may be reasonably well predicted in reg ional forecast models. However it is increasingly clear that both propagation and scattering of sound through upper ocean ducts is s ensitive to finer scale fluctuations that are not included in forecast models. Some of these features arise from complex subduction and stirring patterns of spice (patterns of temperature and salinity that combine to have a neutral effect on ocean density, but an amplified effect on sound speed). Here we propose to contribute novel high resolution shipboard sampling to i) attain high resolutio n snapshots of temperature, salinity and sound speed fluctuations on a range of scales, in coordination with other physical oceanogr aphic and acoustic colleagues, and ii) explore and understand the dynamicalprocesses that mediate upper ocean subduction, stirring a nd mixing, as a step towards developing better model parameterizations. The tools proposed include both a rapid profiling Fast CTD s ystem, and a new towed version of a Phased Array Doppler Sonar being developed with ONR support. The proposed instrumentation will p rovide the horizontal and vertical resolution necessary to map the small scale features relevant to upper ocean sound speed propagat ion and spice subduction and stirring.This abstract is approved for public releaseless",

        "abstract": "Salinity-stratified barrier layers (BLs) act as a barrier to heat and momentum exchange between the surface and subsurface ocean and may have an important role in air-sea interaction. When barrier layers contain temperature inversions (TIs) of water warmer than the sea surface, they can be entrained into the overlying surface mixed layer and work to increase sea surface temperature (SST), hence having a significant impact in mediating air-sea exchanges. In the southeast Arabian Sea, intrusion of fresher and cooler water from the Bay of Bengal is a prime contributor to the formation of winter BLs and TIs, which is associated with a sharp salinity front. Although the salinity front has been recognized as a critical limitation zone of BL formation in the tropical ocean, the role of the salinity front in BL formation in the southeast Arabian Sea has never been investigated. The winter BLs and TIs can affect SST and precondition the upper ocean for the development of the mini-warm pool in the subsequent spring and potentially impact the development of the monsoon. The overarching scientific goal of the proposed work is to determine the role of salinity stratification in thecoupled air-sea exchanges within the vicinity of the southeast Arabian mini-warm pool. Two hypotheses about the nature of salinity variability and its consequences for air-sea interaction will be tested:-(1) First, it is hypothesized that the salinity front in the southeast Arabian Sea, associated with the intrusion of low salinity water from the Bay of Bengal, produces a critical zone for BLand TI formation. This hypothesis will be investigated to advance our knowledge of the dynamical mechanisms controlling the upper ocean stratification in the southeast Arabian Sea.(2) Second, it is hypothesized that the presence of BLs and TIs can significantly affect the development of the mini-warm pool and subsequent air-sea interaction through their influence on SST. Testing this hypothesis will help clarifythe role of salinity stratification on the heat transfer occurring at the air-sea interface and how that subsequently influences the coupled climate system.To test these hypotheses, we propose to conduct underway shipboard measurements across the salinity front to observe the synoptic features of upper ocean stratification in the southeast Arabian Sea. The proposed work will provide insights on the formation of BLs and TIs in the southeast Arabian Sea and their role in the development of the mini-warm pool and subsequent air-sea interactions. Our observations and proposed analysis will also provide a test bed for the evaluation, veracity, and refinement of the ability of numerical models to reproduce the ocean state and predict the strength and timing of the monsoon onset.Approved for Public Releaseless",

Nested architecture will be used as the\" guiding framework for developing new non-uniform hybrid arrays with unique sub-array geometries. Concurrently, the problem of hybri\"d beamforming with such arrays will be addressed by developing aunified optimization framework. Unlike traditional digital beamform\"ing, hybrid beamforming problems are inherently nonconvex.This project will develop a systematic theoretical and algorithmic framewo\"rk to solve and analyze them using semidefinite relaxation techniques. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the art in beamforming techniquesand offer new perspectives into hybrid beamformers. N ested architectures also overcome a long-standing bottlen\"eck of uniform linear (or rectangular arrays) by allowing the localization of more sources than sensors. However, such enhanced capa\"\"bilities typically require larger amount of training data (temporal snapshots). To address this issue, Sparse Bayesian Learning base\"d channel estimation techniques will be developed that can improve the performance of nested arrays in the sample-starved regime and\" enable robust and reliable inference. Sparse Bayesian Learning techniques unify a large family of statistical priors/signal models,\" and can naturally exploit the correlation structure of the data. The project will also generalize these techniques from all-digital\" to hybrid settings, leading to the development of fast algorithms, and new mathematical tools to analyze such hybrid inference prob\"\"lems.

The receiver operates by recovering a signal spread over a minimum frequency range of 10 GHz. In contrast to conventional spread-spectrum receivers, the new device a) eliminates digitization at the full (spreading) rate, b) decodes the channel in a low-latency manner and c) reduces synchronization requirement for the first time. The receiver front-end relies on photonics front-end to perform recovery of the received signal in real time. The new transceiver offers anti-jamming capability not inherent with conventional electronic spread-spectrum receivers. In addition to the high-coding gain objective, the work addresses the feasibility of a monolithically integrated platform that serves as an enabling component for the next-generation signal-processing applications. A specialized control algorithm (operating system) is being investigated in order to transform the new transceiver into a monolithically-enabled, format-independent platform. To develop the new receiver into an operational platform, the work was segmented into a) modeling of silicon/silica physical devices and subsystems; b) operational subsystem testing and signal recovery and c) measuring received signal integrity. Technology limits and comparison with conventional technology is quantified and used to generate performance metrics for the next-generation of spread-spectrum transceivers.less",

This in tu,rn affects the diversity of the talent pool that is available to ONR-funded and Navy research work.This project will be hosted throu,gh three research-intensive universities (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, University of Southern Mi,ssissippi) who will all work with minority serving institutions (MSIs) in their areas as a way to engage with the issue. This initia,l proposal covers a pilot year where all partners will come together to co-design a workshop and larger 5-year program with the goal, to help diversify the talent that is available toNavy-funded research. Both a facilitator and consultant will be involved throughou,t the process in order to receive feedback from all participants on what is or is not effective, which will be used to generate a pr,ogram that has full buy-in and insight from all partners. The end result will have BIPOC undergraduate and/or graduate students from, MSIs introduced and integrated into Navy-related research through summer programs at the research-intensive universities. The facul,ty from the MSIs will engage with faculty on existing Navy-funded projects or will be given the tools to develop their own programs., All faculty involved, regardless of institution, will be given mentorship training that is specifically tailored to address the uni,que challenges that many BIPOC students face. At the end of the pilot year, there will have been an evaluation of the work done to e,nsure the creation of an effective long-term program that can continue to grow or serve as a model for other groups to increase the,participation of BIPOC individuals in ocean sciences.less",

        "abstract": "Project Summary The exchange of material (contaminants, pathogens, sediment, optical clutter, or biota) across the surfzone and the inner-shelf, important to Navy operations, is poorly understood. Breakingwave driven surfzone processes are radically different from the wind, stratification, (non-breaking) wave, and rotation driven processes in the inner-shelf. The time-scales of the processes in the surfzone (mins) and inner-shelf (hours+) are quite different. In the surfzone, onshore wave-induced near-surface mass flux is balanced by return flow at depth (undertow), driving exchange. Rip currents (both transient and bathymetrically controlled) can exchange surfzone water with the innershelf. Yet, rip ejection events are not well characterized. In addition, over a few hours surfzone tracers and drifters are\u201cretained\u201d within a strip about two surfzones wide. On the inner-shelf in 10 m depth, onshore wave-induced Stokes drift balanced against Eulerian cross-shelf flow at depth (similar to undertow) has recently been shown to be important during weak stratification. Diurnal and semi-diurnal internal waves as well as higher frequency internal bores also can induce across inner-shelf exchange. However, the relative importance of these processes is not understood. The interaction of these processes governs exchange, and depends on the waves, wind, tide, and stratification. Lagrangian tracers and drifters are a natural method for studying cross-shore exchange scales and mechanisms. Natural tracers with known sources and sinks such as temperature and turbidity, combined with velocity observations, can reveal 3D aspects of exchange, whereas Lagrangian drifters focus on horizontal (2D) exchange. To study exchange across the surfzone and inner-shelf, we propose to: 1. Use surfzone/inner-shelf models to help develop an optimal array plan in conjunction with DRI participants. 2. For a 2-month base experiment, deploy an array of 10-m depth Wirewalker+ADCP moorings, 5-m depth tripods measuring currents, waves, temperature, and turbidity, and 25 near bottom temperature sensors to measure cross-shore internal bore propagation into the surfzone. 3. For a 14-20 day intensive experiment, perform Lagrangian drifter experiments, and measure inner-shelf temperature and currents synoptically using jetski and small-boat based platforms. 4. Perform quality control, analysis, and modeling Analysis of our Inner-shelf DRI field observations, coupled with our state-of-the-art numerical modeling capability, will be used to diagnose surfzone and inner-shelf cross-shore exchange timescales, length-scales, and the underlying mechanisms. This will lead to improved understanding of surfzone and inner-shelf cross-shore exchange processes.less",

Also heading westward are propagating eddies and waves. The so-called \u201cisland rule\u201d is a theoretical explanation for how wind stress to the east forces western boundary currents on islands. On the other hand, currents on an island\u2019s western boundary may be caused by impinging mean or eddy flow. As these currents encounter topography, they may lead to a cascade through lee waves to the submesoscale. Island trapped waves are types of coastally trapped waves where the alongshore wavenumber is quantized to have an integral number of wavelengths around the island. While these trapped waves are known to be atmospherically forced, another interesting possibility is that flow past an island could cause them. In order to quantify and understand these processes, we propose to use gliders in an observational study targeted at: \u2022 the western boundary current off the east side of islands \u2022 the effect of westward propagating eddies and waves when they hit ridges and islands \u2022 waves and eddies caused by flow over ridges and past islands \u2022 island trapped waves We propose to use Spray underwater gliders to observe these processes. Gliders will be used either to survey by repeating a sequence of lines, or to hold station and act similarly to profiling moorings. The combination of spatial and temporal resolution provided by these glider missions will provide data relevant to the processes outlined above. Gliders will be outfit with sensors to measure pressure, temperature, salinity, and velocity. Year 1 will be devoted to experiment planning. Year 2 will include a full glider-year of observations. Depending on the results of year 1 evaluation, the gliders may be deployed to survey, hold station to allow time series, or in tandem to improve resolution for a shorter time. We anticipate 3-4 month missions in depths of 100-1000 m. Deployments will be done from small boats, while piloting may be done from anywhere with an internet connection. Years 3-4 will include two glider-years of operation each with 2 gliders in the water at all times.

The problem at hand, namely the quantification of the turbulent eddy exchange throughout this r egion from the mesoscale field to the feature rich sub-mesoscale velocity field, is elusive and not treatable with a purely modelin g approach. In-situ observations are needed for model validation, and wherever possible, for data assimilation. We propose a Lagran gian experiment that uses water-following, satellite-tracked Surface Velocity Program (SVP) drifters drogued at 15 m depth to direct ly measure the surface kinetic energy at the sub-mesoscale (1-10km). We envision the deployment of four large arrays of 50 Lagrangi an drifters each, designed to resolve a variety of spatial and temporal scales, ranging from ~100 km to a few km (sub-mesoscale). We plan to operate during the two seasons when the eddy kinetic energy levelsare largest, that is, during the summer and the winter mo nsoons. The two concurrent dense arrays of drifters will be deployed using two different ships. Our preferred locations are the Sout h China Sea, between Kaohsiung and DongSha Atoll, and the region between Palau and Guam. Our approach, combined with satellite altim etry data, will allow the computation of both eddy kinetic energy at a range of spatial scales, mesoscale and sub mesoscale, and of the calculation of momentum and vorticity fluxes using established methodologies. These quantities will be compared to results from numerical models and will ultimately help in assessing and improving the model parameterizations of energy at meso and, wherever po ssible, sub-meso scales. We will work with the selected teams to design a shared observational strategy. The proposing PI has worke d in the region since 2002 and has collected a Lagrangian drifter dataset that will constitute one of the starting points to help d efine our observational approach.

The advantages of alumina(Al2O3) over state-of-the-art gain materials such as yttriumaluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12, YAG) and laser glasses aresignificant; it has higher thermal conductivess, all attributesthat could lead to more stable, more powerful lasers in mobileapplications important to ONR, DoD and the DE community.We propose to dope the ceramics with a variety of rare earths,providing emission at various wavelengths particularly inregions where pulsed, high power laser choices are limited.Despite promising attributes, producing RE doped aluminaceramics for lasers has steep synthesis/processing challenges.They cannot be made using traditional equilibrium methodssuch as Czochralski single crystal growth or traditionalsintering because the equilibrium solubility limits of REs in the Al2O3 is on the order of 10-3 to 10 -4 at%, not high enough to produce lasing (~1 to 10-1 at%). Recently however we have produced Nd-doped alumina (Nd:Al2O3) with transmission and dopant concentrations high enough toproduce population insertion and gain (Figure 1 and see preliminary results) an achievement that will produce the first Nd:Al2O3 laser emitting at ~1064 nm. We have demonstrated that this new gain material has broader wavelength bandwidth than RE doped glasses (needed to produce ultrashortpulses) and higher thermal conductivity than RE doped YAG (needed achieve high pulse repetition rates i. e. high average power) [1]. Here we plan to significantly extend the usability by producing the first RE:Al2O3, pulsed lasers. The result will be gain materials/lasers that can be pumped harder than RE:YAG crystals while delivering shorter pulses at higher repetition ratesthan RE:Glasses.The work will be divided into three Research Directions powder with various RE dopants (Nd, Er, Yb, Tm) at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 at%). The powders will be densified, producing laser quality ceramic disks which can be cut into bars, slabs or used as disks in laser cavities. Development of rare earth doped polycrystalline alumina (RE:Al2O3) for short pulsed, high powered lasers. RD2) Characterize optical properties and material microstructure. We will extensively characterize the ceramic nano/microstructure (grain size, RE dopant concentration and distribution) to provide feedback for improving optical performance of ceramics. We will measure absorption cross section, emission cross-sections, emission lifetimes. Measurements will be doneat room and cryogenic temperatures to better understand absorption and emission physics (we have down to capabilities down to 8K). We will also perform single pass gain and damage threshold experiments to provide design parameters for laser designs. RD3) Design and construct pulsed lasers from RE:Al2O3 ceramics. We will use similar pulseamplification, Q-switching, and mode-locking schemes that have been developed for RE:YAG,RE:Glass and RE:YLF. For example, we will use a electro-optic Q-switching with lithium niobateor KDP Pockels cell. Another design possibility is a passively mode-locked cavity using Fabry-Perot saturable absorbers (FPSA). Semiconductor based FPSAs can be obtained commercially fora variety of wavelengths. These initial deigns will be optimized according to the opticalperformance of the RE:Al2O3 ceramics. We propose to concentrate on Nd, Er and Tm as dopantsto deliver 1 - 2 m pulsed lasers.less",

Such data suffers from a number of initial ambiguities such as range, depth, and heading of the object of interest, based on the limitations of the collecting device. So, for example, using a linear towed array, beam-forming techniques can only in,dicate the horizontal angles of arrival of the ambient acoustic environment because it is essentially a one-dimensional receiver.

MMM emitters will be the first metamaterial that is thermodynamically stable at high temperatures (800-1500 oC) oxidative environment. As a demonstration of the superb properties of the MMM, we will integrate the MMM emitter into a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system with a matching PV cell for direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion with unprecedentedly high efficiency of > 50%. Recent breakthroughs in TPV cells have achieved ~30% efficiency with blackbody emitters of 1200-2000 oC and ~ 40% efficiency with ultra-high temperature blackbody emitter over 2100 oC. Selective narrowband emitters have long been pursued to boost the TPV efficiency > 50% by only emitting photons around the bandgap of the TPV cell. However, none of them are stable due to degradation of constituent materials (metallic and dielectric) and their interfaces. Our team has recently developed a narrowband TPV emitter based on a novel molten meta-material (MMM). The emitters are uniquely suitable for high-T, high-efficiency (>50%) TPV. Our MMM emitters have already shown unprecedented stability (at 1200 oC in air for >100 hours) and are expected to be stable at 1500 oC in medium vacuum (10 mTorr) over 30 year after structural optimization in this project. The MMM can be used to produce narrowband emission with near-unity maximum emittance around the bandgap of a TPV cell. The emitter will be integrated with an efficient thin film TPV cell for high system-level performance with >50% thermal-to-electrical efficiency, >3.6 W/cm2 electrical power density, and >30 yrlifetime. This efficiency will be the highest for any single-stage thermal-to-electrical converters. It will lead to low cost, lightweight, noise-free, portable, high density power generation systems. The high-T efficient TPV will be a disruptive technology for power generation for a wide range of thermal energy sources, including heat from combustion of various fuels (gas, oil, wood, garbage, etc), high-temperature waste heat (e.g., from ships), solar heat, nuclear, etc.. The technology is especially suitable for portable power systems (e.g., for individuals in remote locations). As the only high-temperature air-stable metamaterial we are aware of, the MMM emitter can also be broadly applicable to applications beyond TPV, e.g., THz sources for portable detectors and miniaturized FTIR spectrometers, radiative cooling and thermal camouflage of high-temperature objects, etc.less",

The system has proved itself as a robust and reliable platform, providing flexibility for the addition of new sensors and autonomous payloads. Hundreds of vehicles have been sold to navies across the world, and the platform is in two U.S. Navy Program of Records. The elegance of its original design is reflected in the fact that the base hardware architecture has largely remained unchanged for the past 20 years.

There is increasing evidence of active Langmuir activity during periods of rapid sea-state development, a situation not addressed by classical theory. Here we propose to monitor the space-time development of the Langmuir field by deploying three novel instrument systems from the Research Platform FLIP. A 200 kHz phased array Doppler sonar will be used to produce images of acoustic scattering strength and sea surface velocity in 64 beams over a 90 degree sector that extends up to 1.5 km from FLIP. This will enable documentation of the evolving Langmuir field in transient conditions. A Wirewalker vertically-profiling instrument system will be deployed from one of FLIP\u2019s booms to provide CTD and ocean velocity information in the upper 150 m of the sea, profiling through the mixed layer and upper thermocline at ~15 minute intervals with 1m vertical resolution. In a new, development, the Wirewalker will be motorized, enabling it to work from FLIP in calm conditions with no loss of performance. Finally, it is proposed to deploy a ~1km floating optical fiber to measure the sea surface temperature fluctuations induced by Langmuir cells. The fiber will trail downstream of the anchored FLIP, enabling arrange-time view of temperature fluctuations with ~10 m resolution.less",

We have three objectives: 1) test the accuracy, repeatability, robustness, and response to environmental conditions; 2) resurvey a number of locations in California previously surveyed with an absolute gravity meter to determine water table changes over the past three decades; 3) begin the process of adapting the quantum gravity meter to seafloor applications. This research will address three items enumerated in the BAA: I.9.2.9, Underwater Sensors; I.9.2.11, Corrections of Signals in Next Generation sub-micro-Gal Absolute Gravimeter Measurements; and I.9.2.21, Understanding Water budgets. The primary research goal is to gain experience with the new cold atom interferometric technology for gravity measurement. Compared to the existing free-fall methods, the quantum gravity meter promises higher accuracy, better robustness for continuous operation, and recoilless measurements (ground recoil is an effect that has prevented successful free-fall measurements on the seafloor). In our technical approach we plan a series of accuracy tests on our laboratory shake-table and in our cold vault, the collection of a long time-series at our geophysical observatory to search for correlations with other environmental factors, a re-survey of absolute sites in California established in the 1980s to gain ground water information, and an assessment of the steps needed to adapt the system to seafloor use. If the technology stands up to our series of experiments and deployments we anticipate an outcome that includes expanded use of absolute gravity to study water table changes and a roadmap to the establishment of absolute gravity sites on the seafloor. The utility of extending repeated absolute gravity measurements to the seafloor has been recognized for some time. The rate of uplift or subsidence near mid-ocean ridges or subduction zones could be determined, magma motions could be detected, the details of ocean-crust deformation could be established, and even sea level variations in the middle of the ocean, far from land based tide gauges, could be tracked. Few viable methods exist to detect long term vertical motions of the seafloor. The capability to measure gravity with 1 part in 109 accuracy (corresponding to a height sensitivity of 3 to 5 mm) on the bottom of the ocean would truly be transformative to marine geodesy and geodynamics.less",

These distributed measurements will be augmented by a relatively incrementaldesign change to our time-proven Wirewalker wave-powered vehicle to allow autonomous profiling control for tracking depth and isopycnal surfaces. While each improved system will individually augment current and planned ONR efforts, the co-development of these technologies allows for their integration. Here we plan to combine the technologies by building an surface mooring with integrated optical fibers. DTS/DAS measurement will be acquired continuously in depth and time along the mooring wire via an interrogator in the surface buoy, while a Wirewalker, affixed to the same wire, will provide user or autonomous-selected variable profiling. This #peanut-butter and jelly# synergy combines the strengths of both platforms while minimizing their weaknesses: the relatively slow Wirewalkerprovides multi-parameter profiles with oceanographic precision and high vertical resolution on time scales of tens on minutes, while the DTS provides temperature measurements at all depths every few seconds. Fiber Optic DTS improvements: DTS is a revolutionary sensing technology pioneered for oceanographic measurements by our group. DTS has been proven in fixed mounted deployments across large temperature gradient regimes. Future in the deep-sea, the mixed layer, and towed applications will challenge the precision of current commercially available DTS systems. Moreover, #navigation# of a fiber optic cable to earth or fluid referenced coordinate systems requires very detailed information regarding the cable shape, particularly in towed scenarios. Modern distributed acoustic sensing (also known as strain sensing) is capable of determining cable catenary as a function of length for the validation of towed cable models. Our proposed development of an improved DTS/DAS combination system could be used in a fixed-in-place seabed mode, deployed from moored surface buoys, and could be directly and easily added to our group#s shipboard profiling systems, turning the profiling or tow cable itself into a sensor. In a moored, autonomous mode, a vertical DTS/DAS fiber optic cable has the potential to provideeffectively continuous time and vertical temperature measurement over ranges larger than the average ocean depth (i.e. >3km). The Wirewalker improvements: ocean-wave-powered profiling system is a proven platform used several past and present ONR DRIs. The current mechanically actuated version will be augmented by an incremental change to include user or autonomous actuation. The design isbased on a successful actuator and controller development for our towed Phased Array Doppler Sonar fish and our rapid profiling Fast-CTD fish. Although an incremental design change to the overall Wirewalker system, this will be a major enhancement because it willallow parking or hovering at user or autonomously specified isobar or isopycnal or isotachs or isolume, etc., to collect time-series or to employ slow response sensors like those common for biogeochemical measurements. When deployed on a profiling cable with an integrated optical fiber, collecting DTS/DAS measurements simultaneously ameliorates the #cost# of parking/hovering (i.e. being a fixed depth).This abstract is publicly releasable.less",

        "abstract": "In the last decade the PIs of this proposal have been conducting routine observations of directional wave spectra from specialized drifters and floats that are available in ship and airdeployable configurations. The data collected by the PIs have been provided in real-time to forecasters through operational data relay systems as well as to researchers through dedicated data relay systems (both real-time and delayed mode) maintained by the Lagrangian Drifter laboratory of Scripps and by NOAAs AOML. In this proposal, we intend to work with NOPP participants to target observations and deploy instrumentation to help improve understanding of coastal impacts hurricanes through off-shore waves wind, atmospheric mesoscale events as well as coastal surge and inundation. Our new generation of A-size wave drifters are now deployable from NOAAs P3 and other smaller planes and, as such, are creating new deployment opportunities because of their versatility and ease of deployment. The instruments discussed in this proposal were developed by the LDL and MRV/WHOI are already cleared for deployment by the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (WRS) Hurricane Hunters WC-130J aircraft. We propose to target offshore wave observations under hurricane conditions, that will serve, among other uses, to constrain the boundary conditions of coastal inundation models. The two instrument packages (i.e., drifters and floats) will provide a complete picture of the offshore ocean conditions including surface velocity and integrated upper-level velocity, mixed-layer structure, sea-level-pressure, surface winds, and temperature as well as three-dimensional wave spectra. Our participation in this program is extremely timely since the technical developments have already been concluded and the technology of air-deployable DWSD and ALAMO floats is ready to be applied to scientific investigations and in a near-operational context. We propose to fabricate and deploy 32 A-size DWSBD as well as an ALAMO float with a wave sensor in each of the 3 years of fieldwork and provide the quality-controlled data to the NOPP participants. The locations for deployment of our instruments will be determined in collaboration with the Task 1-2 and Task 4 modeling partners to test theories of targeted observations.less",

Specifically, we request funds a) to procure and install a Kongsberg HiPAP acoustic underwater navigation system, b) to procure and install a Kongsberg-Simrad EK80 midwater imaging sonar, and c) to procure and install a seawater carbon dioxide measuring instrument. Together, these instruments will be integrated into the vessel's system of sensors that image, measure, track objects and characterize the water beneath and around the vessel.The proposed system of instruments will strongly benefit a broad number of current and anticipated ONR research programs. ONR experiments involve moorings, free-swimming vehicles, over-the side instruments, and near-bottom cabled instruments. Recently-completed and ongoing examples include ASIAEX, NLIWI, ITOP, QPE, PhilEx, IWISE, ASIRI, FLEAT, PISTON and MISO-BOB, with similar needs anticipated for future DRIs. To conduct these operations, information is often required about objects in the water beneath and around the vessel. The HiPAP system will be able to track multiple targets, including autonomous underwater vehicles, remote underwater vehicles, drifters, towed sonars, water profilers, and other cabled and free-swimming objects. The midwater imaging sonar uses multiple frequencies to quantitatively estimate the biomass of organisms for several hundred meters through the water column and differentiate major groups of fishes and other organisms based on signal characteristics. The proposed instrument system will strongly benefit the educational missions of SIO and ONR, by its routine use during SIO class deployments, student-led projects supported by the UC Ship Funds Program, and ONR-supported educational projects such as In the footsteps of Roger Revelle.The timing of this request is intended to coincide with the upcoming midlife refit of Roger Revelle, during which we intend to install a gondola that will house the ship???s acoustic transducers to improve sonar performance. The gondola we intend to install will house the five transducers for the EK80 midwater imaging system, as well as most of the ship???s other acoustic sensors. The HiPAP system requires the installation of a retractable stem upon which the transducer head is installed, and installation of the machinery included in this unit requires significant modification to the hull. The pCO2 system requires integration into the ship???s uncontaminated seawater system, with additional inputs from the meteorological sensor suite and reference gas samples. Each of these components requires significant design, engineering and installation effort that can only be conducted during a drydocking. In addition, by undertaking these important upgrades during the midlife refit shipyard, we will be able to take advantage of significant cost and production efficiencies.less",

        "abstract": "Image sensors are common in almost every mobile device. They excel at acquiring and coding video streams at high efficiency on the transmitter side, and at high fidelity in reconstruction at the receiver end. They are the result of extensive engineering optimization in serving applications of visual communication where fidelity in pictorial appearance is a main design criterion. In contrast, emerging applications of navigation, spatial mapping, and visually directed search in autonomous mobile systems on robotic and aerial platforms call for a different type of vision sensor, coding visual information rather than appearance, and optimized for performance and efficiency in detecting and interpreting salient features and key events in the visual scene. Such event-driven vision sensors interface naturally with \u201cspiking\u201d neural networks for visual cognition realized using neuromorphic integrated circuits. This project leads towards practical realization and commercial development of versatile vision sensors facilitating effective and efficient navigation and search in autonomous aerial swarm systems. A first aim of the project is development and application of a neuromorphic vision sensor front-end and video analytics back-end tailored for visually guided navigation and search in aerial contextual robotics. Spatial and temporal visual coding schemes inspired by biological vision systems guide the design of the vision sensor front-end. Performance and efficiency of the front-end integrated with a neuromorphic pattern recognition back-end and mounted on an aerial platform (drone) are evaluated for event detection and object recognition. The aerial vision system realized using custom very-large scale integrated (VLSI) neuromorphic vision chips is benchmarked against emulated sensor front-end and recognition back-end models. These back-end models use commercial vision sensors and equivalent external signal processing to explore the impact of the parameter range on various performance metrics. A second aim of the project is to improve on the effectiveness of the back-end in the absence of direct user supervision or intervention, through on-line deep learning. On-line learning is of paramount importance to autonomous cognitive aerial systems for visual reconnaissance\u2014which must make independent decisions purely based on visual input. To date such developments have been lacking. As such, applications of drones have hitherto been limited mostly to cloud-connected human-assisted functions, except for basic navigation skills. The project thus also targets hardware-software codesign of reconfigurable and custom-VLSI accelerators for on-line learning and inference in deep neural networks, as the backbone for the recognition back-end providing the capacity to autonomously acquiring visual reconnaissance functions in unguided aerial navigation. These accelerators serve as versatile testbeds for rapid prototyping of new on-line learning algorithms for large-scale, low precision (binary), sparse (event-driven) neural network architectures, processing, and learning from continuous visual data streams encountered in complex, continually changing and unpredictable mobile aerial environments. The outcomes of the project may lead to new generations of configurable neuromorphic vision systems that can be parameter tuned in-situ for optimal performance and efficiency, towards aerial swarm systems with unprecedented autonomy and resilience in visually guided navigation and search. These outcomes have the potential to revolutionize applications of aerial swarms, such as fully unattended fleet surveillance, homeland security, border patrol, and rescue missions in harmful environments. To demonstrate the potential for impact of the developed neuromorphic cognitive vision systems on relevant applications, the final validation entails expanded aerial navigation/reconnaissance tasks of interest to unmanned autonomous surveillance and rescue operations.less",

However, the temporal coverage of low earth orbiting satellites is not optimal. Since 2010, the Air-Sea interaction Laboratory at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has developed the Modular Aerial Sensing System (MASS; Melville et al. 2016), an instrument system specifically designed to study ocean processes with time scales of hours to days (i.e. submesoscale), coastal processes, and air-sea-land interactions in the coastal zone all of which are relevant for improved understanding of physical, biological and chemical processes. In this project, we propose to upgrade the current capability of the MASS lidar, to at least double the swath width of the older MASS lidar, while improving the spatial resolution. This would significantly improve observations of air-sea interaction and surface processes, in particular in the context of submesoscale research, where fast response surveys are often required, to avoid temporal aliasing, as it extends the ocean topographic coverage over one pass, without the need for multiple passes. Additionally, and as importantly, the new lidar would effectively enable flights at much higher altitude, significantly broadening the cross-track spatial coverage of all other MASS optical sensors.

        "abstract": "Marine mammals, particularly beaked whales, are of concern to the US Navy regarding noise impacts during naval training exercises. T,o successfully quantify behavioral responses to noise and potential short- and long-term impacts, it is essential to understand indi,viduals and their behaviors under natural as well as disturbed circumstances. Behavioral responses caused by naval sound sources, es,pecially mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), will likely be dependent upon the behavioral state of an individual. This behavioral sta,te in turn is often driven by the underlying environmental conditions that determine prey distributions.The pelagic environment whic,h marine mammals inhabit is a highly dynamic, mobile environment. Dynamic ecosystem-based management and impact mitigation requires,a holistic view of the pelagic ecosystem, with an understanding of the organismal, individual behavior of the top predator but also,deep knowledge of the composition and behavior of prey communities as well as underlying physics of the pelagic. Due to the elusive,nature of marine mammal prey and their remote, deep-sea habitat, knowledge on their presence, abundance, behavior, and distribution,is extremely limited. Enhancement of our understanding requires the application of a suite of state-of-the-art technology. Here we,propose to improve the instrumentation for deep sea acoustic and optical predator-prey observations. It is intended to procure compo,nents to assemble one passive-active acoustic tracking mooring, four autonomous deep sea camera systems and four animal-borne camera, tags.The proposed instrumentation is designed to gather detailed insights into predator-prey dynamics and associated oceanography i,n the deep sea, with a focus on beaked whales. This is done through combined passive acoustic tracking and visual recording of prey,, in their habitat as well as from the direct perspective of the predator. The passive-active acoustic tracking (PAAT) mooring is des,igned to determine deep-sea prey abundance and distribution, how these are influenced by oceanographic conditions, and how these con,sequently influence predator foraging behavior and habitat use. However, with this instrumentation we lack more complex identificati,on of prey species, their size classes and precise behavioral interactions of predator and prey. Data collection will therefore be e,xtended with concurrent recording by autonomous deep sea camera systems and animal-borne camera tags. With this holistic suite of se,nsors, we can begin to incorporate ecosystem-based management practices to mitigate noise impacts on marine mammals, specifically be,aked whales, caused by US Navy training operations.This project summary is publicly releasable.less",

The enhanced thermal conductivity is achieved primarily through the design and fabrication of highly anisotropic grains, with nanometer dimensions along the two optical axes (to minimize photon scattering) and micrometer dimensions in the cooling direction (preserving high thermal conductivity). The proposed research effort integrates modeling and experimental efforts in chemistry, materials processing, materials characterization, thermal transport, and laser engineering to fully address the stated technical objective.

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots capable of burial and locomotion beneath the sea-floor have myriad applications of Naval relevance such as structural inspection, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and biological observation. However, current aquatic robots are either capable of swimming movement through water, or have limited capabilities of moving through the granular or muddy seafloor medium. Granular environments such as sandy seabeds, are one of the most prevalent substrates on Earth, and yet one of the most difficult environments for robots to move within. Locomotion within granular media requires robots to overcome large depth-dependent forces, contend with non-zero yield stress that may cause unpredictable fluid/solid resistance forces, and perform with extremely limited sensing capabilities.Many animals, on the other hand, are able to skillfully transition between swimming and burial locomotion within the seafloor. For example, small polychaetes (bristle worms) are capable of swimming near the sea-floor surface and transitioning to digging locomotion within the sea-bed through undulatory motion of their soft bodies. Polychaetes use a variety of behaviors to control the drag and resistive forces acting on them during digging, including:1)local fluidization and hydraulic fracture, 2) crack propagationthrough body eversion at the head, and 3) modulation of internal pressure to anchor and propagate cracks. In this proposal we will study how a soft robot can utilize these three principles to control the resistive granular forces during digging locomotion.The work in this proposal will leverage a previously funded ONR developed robot, which we call a Swimming and Digging Worm-inspired robot #SanD-Worm#. Prior work on the SanD-Worm project studied how combinations of body undulation and appendage actuation enabled digging locomotion, and obstacle sensing. In the proposed work, we will build off of the knowledge gained from SanD-Worm and we will integrate this into a nextgeneration robot, Self-Sufficient Swimming and Digging Worm-inspired robot (S2 SanD-Worm). This project will benefit from over five years of research on soft robots for subterranean locomotion by PIs Gravish and Tolley.The mechanical design of SanD-Worm will use soft exterior materials such as silicone and other elastomers to achieve a soft, expandable exterior body. A fundamental area of research is determining how body movements weaken or strengthen submerged granular material; weakening is required for reducing drag force on the body, and strengthening is required to generate forward thrust forces. The design and testing of this system leverages PI#s Gravish and Tolley#s combined expertise in the physics of granular flow (Gravish), and the design and control of soft-robots (Tolley). The project will be performed in three phases (assicated with the tasks of fluidization, low-boiling point fluid actuation, and eversion enabled locomotion), culminating in a robot demonstration of locomotion capabilities in year three.less",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of developing new Ultra-High Temperature Materials (UHTMs) is challenged by two significant scientific and technological hurdles being addressed in this proposal. The first hurdle is that previous efforts to increase the temperature range for new materials, driven solely by thermodynamic consideration of increasing enthalpy, have not led to any paradigm changes inmaterial performance. Recently, our efforts under an existing ONR-MURI entitled The Science of Entropy Stabilized Ultra-High Temperature Materials has resulted in the development of a broad class of new ceramics based on the concept of increasing the entropic state of a material that results in increased thermal stability with increasing temperature. Validation of the entropic kickrequires determination of several thermodynamic properties, specifically melting temperature and a lower temperature phase transition. With increasingly higher thermal properties of these materials, measurement of these critical validation parameters is beyond the capabilities of most laboratories. The second hurdle of this research is the technological challenge of accurately measuring a melting temperature above 4000C. Another major challenge in the materials development field is the extremely slow process of experimental validation of new bulk alloys; this challenge is also being addressed in this proposal.Our Twofold Scientific and Technological Objectives are (1) to develop the unique XRDUHTM characterization platform and completely validate its accuracy in measuring material thermodynamic properties such as very high solid-state phase transition temperature (Tc) and melting temperatures (Tm). These data will directly contribute to validation of the underlying science of five+-component entropy-stabilized UHTMs (ESUHTMs) and other advanced refractory alloys; and (2) to enhance the development of a unique high-throughput alloy development methodology that utilizes our previous 2016 DURIP-funded LAMS-UHTMs laseradditive facility for high-throughput alloy fabrication and with the current proposed XRD-UHTM system enabling the high-throughput XRD analysis of the sample array fabricated by the LAMSUHTM system. This secondary goal of the proposal will be a paradigm change in the field of experimental validation of new alloys of interest to the DoD community.The proposed XRD-UHTMs system will be used both for the specific, unique experiments outlined herein, but also housed and made available through our shared user facility, the NE-MRC, directly supporting a wide array of research projects in physical metallurgy and ceramics as well as additive manufacturing, and nanoengineering, disciplines that are critically important to theDoD mission. The close collaboration among two California public schools, University of California, San Diego and San Diego State University (a Title V Hispanic Serving Institution), is an additional strength.less",

        "abstract": "Novel acoustic Doppler sensing techniques are an integral part of improved observational and eventually predictive capability of the complex dynamical processes that govern upper ocean shear, strain, turbulent dissipation, and sound speed profiles. Work underway i n multiple recent ONR DRIs (ASIRI, SODA, NISKINe, FLEAT, MISO-BoB) has emphasized the role of coherent structures in setting both pa tterns of upper ocean shear/strain, and mediating heat fluxes. Our ability to parameterize such phenomena is largely limited by a pa ucity of observations of the fully three-dimensional nature of relevant dynamics. Those structures include a hierarchy ranging from sub-mesoscale and frontal instabilities with lateral scales of hundreds of meters, through the cascade of breaking internal waves fr om hundreds down to tens of meters horizontally, all the way to three dimensional turbulence with meter and below scales.Here we pro pose continued development and expansion of Phased Array Doppler Sonar capabilities that we have begun with previous DURIP funding. On a vehicle towed sub-surface (behind a ship), the PADS can see synoptic swaths of ocean velocity structure out tens to hundreds of meters laterally (depending on acoustic frequency). A prototype instrument built with previous DURIP support (N00014-18-1-2836) was successfully deployed on the R/V Sproul in March 2021. Here we request funding to take the next steps in phased array development, focusing on i) continued development of embedded chip systems for data processing, ii) expansion of the array size, iii) refinement of tow-body stability, and iv) exploration of novel acoustic sensing materials. The goal is to produce an operational T-PADS system for initial deployment during the 2022 NORSE experiment in the North Atlantic.This abstract is publicly releasable.less",

Cooperative missions by heterogenous groups of unmanned vehicles (UxVs) are an emerging technique with growing naval applications. Platform heterogeneity provides an opportunity to leverage different vehicle capabilities for detection, tracking, and characterization with tradeoffs between speed, persistence, and mechanical-noise of the platform. At present, the major challenge in heterogenous UxV missions is the networking, information flow, and data synthesis for adaptive sampling in a timely manner. The proposed system will combine recent work by the PIs in algorithm development for automated signature detection and tracking from X-Band radar, environmentally-aware coordinated USV/UUV autonomy, and fundamental problems in air-sea interaction associated with wavecurrent interaction.

Three issues regarding phase coupling of brain oscillations will be examined here: 1) Gamma phase shifts across the cortex: What is the spatial organization of gamma oscillations across the cortical surface? 2) Dynamics in a 2-D model of interacting cortical columns. How do the spatial patterns observed in the cortex arise from interactions between neighboring cortical columns? 3) Impact of cortical feedback: How is information transmission between two cortical layers affected by the relative phases of their local gamma band oscillations?less",

        "abstract": "Abstract: The proposed research aims to characterize the undersea environment based on a large number of heterogeneous acoustic information sources. The considered scenario consists of various sensors that record acoustic data in a shallow water environment. Broadband acoustic signals, including noise emitted by large ships, breaking waves, or marine mammals, will be used for geoacoustic inversion (GI).The methodologies developed in this project will consistently combine or #fuse# acoustic data from different information sources in a Bayes framework and at a very attractive computational cost. Information sources can either be raw acoustic sensor data, preprocessing results of a linear filter, or the result of a GI preprocessing stage. Bayesian estimation will embed acoustic models of undersea sound propagation. While a large variety of methodological approaches for GI are available in the literature, little attention has been paid to data fusion and scalability of computational complexity. This project will push the envelope of undersea environment characterization by addressing these limitations. It relies on the framework of graph-based Bayesian estimation and will develop critical innovations in the following three research areas (RAs).# RA 1, #Fundamental Limits of Data Fusion for GI# will apply recent results on Fisher information analysis to the uncertain ocean acoustic environments of real GI experiments. The resulting uncertainty characterization will provide essential insights into error sensitivity and error propagation in GI problems.# RA 2, #Model-Based Data Fusion for GI# will introduce graph-based Bayesian methods for undersea environment characterization that can consistently combine information provided by heterogenous data sources and that are scalable in the sense that their performance improves with a growing number of sensors while their computational cost remains feasible.# RA 3, #Learning-Aided Data Fusion for GI# will introduce truly novel GI methods where operations performed by graph-based Bayesian estimation are enhanced by a graph neural network (GNN). The GNN is either trained with annotated real data or synthesized data from undersea acoustic models.The main innovation of this project is that GI based on heterogeneous data sources will be performed in an overarching Bayesian framework combined with deep learning. This holistic approach is expected to improve undersea environmental characterization. Future Naval Relevance: Innovation resulting from this project are novel methods for GI that substantially improve the performance of marine sensing systems and thus lead to tangible advantages across multiple naval applications. In particular, the proposed research aims at developing capabilities that can potentially be implemented at large scales and provide an undersea environmental characterization at high resolution.Datasets: For performance evaluation, we will use datasets from ONR-funded projects. In particular, wewill use data collected during the shallow water evaluation cell experiment 1996 (SWellEx-96), the shallow water experiment 2006 (SW-06), and the seabed characterization experiment 2017 (SBCEX-17). These datasets are made available to the PI by the Marine Physical Laboratory. In all experiments, different acoustic arrays were deployed. In addition to broadband acoustic noise, e.g., as emitted by large cargo ships, tonal and broadband acoustic signals are projected by acoustic sources that have been towed by a research vessel.Approved for Public Releaseless",

Alternative radiation shielding high-z (atomic number) materials concepts, including tungsten particles and integral metallic foil liner materials integrated with graphite fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite structures, were evaluated analytically and experimentally for simulated x-ray environments. The metallic foil materials concept is based using the Metallic Intermetallic Laminates (MIL) technology patented by UCSD, a subcontract team partner for this project, and using high-z materials such as tantalum. A Phase II program is proposed to develop and demonstrate the integrated composite structure and radiation shielding materials approach. Integrated designs will be developed for representative EKV components such as the sensor sunshade, LDACS main structure, or ECU electronic enclosures. Radiation shielding materials concepts such as the tungsten loaded polymer matrix and tantalum MIL foils will be further developed and tested in simulated x-ray environments. A full-scale prototype EKV component structure will be fabricated and mechanical and simulated x-ray environment testing conducted to demonstrate the full-scale component performance.less",

Current classification methods require near exact replication of the original imaging parameters, or extensive modeling in order to generalize the signature to novel operating conditions. By understanding the physical constraints on the target information, one can better construct and refine a classification system. In Phase I, we applied recent bounds, developed for electromagnetic scattering, to analyze optical wavelengths, and we now propose to develop and transition tools to use these bounds to explore feature salience, recognition, and classification.

This is not due to a lack of transducers, for there are many physical properties of a molecule or nanostructure that can be harnessed to perform the basic sensing task. The absence is due to problems in integrating science with technology into a small, portable, packageable scale. While it is relatively easy for the instrument designer to incorporate capabilities to correct for zero-point drift, changing background matrix, or shifting environmental factors into a macroscopic analytical device, it is difficult to build such functions into a micro-scale device without significant power budget or other design penalties. This proposal aims to add such sophisticated functions into a small, low-power package using porous-silicon technology and to integrate this package into a body-worn, wireless sensor-system. The specific goal is to build a photonic material that acts as a low-power sensor for a broad class of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) while displaying relative immunity towards changes in relative humidity, the ability to differentiate between VOCs within the family that the sensor will detect and to provide a means of estimating the concentration of the VOC.less",

The project objective is to demonstrate a new technique based on piezoelectric rosette nodes for (1) locating the points of impact or growing damage in realistic aerospace structures, (2) identifying the magnitude of the impact force, and (3) discriminating whether an impact has caused structural damage or not. These capabilities are not available to date, with the necessary accuracy levels, for aerospace structures which are complex in either materials (anisotropic, etc..) or geometries (multilayered, tapered, etc..). Phase II work will culminate with the assembly and the demonstration of an impact/damage monitoring prototype with capabilities (1) through (3) above. The Phase II work will be performed by Avanti Tech, LLC and by the subcontractor University of California at San Diego.

While DoD originally was the driver for and major customer of electronics components in the 1960s, today the total DoD usage of electronics components is now lest than 1%. These economic realities have caused a current situation in which space programs have a limited and diminishing supplier base. Coupled with the stringent screening, qualification, documentation, and oversight of agencies such as DSCC, many commercial component suppliers have exited the DoD business as seen in Figure 1. This dependency on few suppliers is a well known problem and is highly undesirable.

The simulator interfaces directly to a channel impairment emulator, and together (simulator and emulator) they provide the capability to evaluate wireless systems operating within a realistic scenario. In Phase I, we developed the prototype tool, built a relevant operational scenario, and demonstrated the real-time visualization of time varying RF link characteristics. In Phase II, we will complete and deliver the simulator, along with supporting datasets, external applications, and model libraries. We will advance the underlying algorithms and models, interface and test to multiple channel emulators, and demonstrate the real-time channel characterization capability.less",

        "abstract": "The physical oceanography of the Seychelles is dominated by two distinctive features: strong shifts in monsoonal forcing that drive significant changes in regional circulation; and its unique geographic location atop the Mascarane Plateau, a broad shallow shelf bordered on all sides by deep ocean. These two components represent significant challenges for predictive modeling at local scales and point towards a number of important physical phenomena that are likely to be important. The islands thus present a valuable venue for development of analytical and numerical modeling capabilities for flow in complex environments. Seasonal changes in boundary conditions at the edges of the Mascarane Plateau suggest an important role for internal waves, with associated mixing and with residual energy radiation towards the center of the plateau. At longer timescales, we can expect that changes in the larger scale mesoscale structure will propagate inwards on the plateau via low-mode waves driving a phase-shifted seasonal relaxation of the low frequency local circulation. At shorter timescales, the shallow depths and complex bathymetry suggest that bottom friction, form drag and flow separation will play important roles in local scale momentum balances. Despite dedicated local efforts to sustainable marine resource use, Seychelles has been lacking in an observation physical oceanography program. Local physical oceanographic data for the Seychelles is scarce and little or no efforts have been undertaken for local modeling. Here we propose to address this data scarcity via an observational campaign focused on local Seychelles circulation, providing input for a separate numerical modeling effort. In addition, we propose a focused outreach effort that aims to develop local observational capabilities that can provide relevant basic data as input to operational modeling at local scales. The work will be closely coordinated with other ONR funded researchers to maximize the value of observations towards modeling efforts. The overarching goal for the proposed work is to develop predictive capabilities for physical oceanography for the Seychelles region in support of locally relevant marine applications while providing context for larger scale NASCar efforts. A key objective for the project is to establish local capacity for ocean observations in the Seychelles region that will lead to sustained longterm data collection efforts. In collaboration with local partners, we aim to further carry out an observational program that will provide a foundational data set for regional and local scale modeling efforts. The data set will be critical in identifying primary forcing mechanisms for local oceanography in a complex and relatively undersampled environment.less",

The USVs will be equipped with instrumentation to accurately measure the directional wave spectrum of surface gravity waves and near-surface meteorological properties, leveraging previously funded development efforts to develop low-cost, accurate sensors that are robust for operation in the marine environment. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and Conductivity/Temperature sensor will provide continuous upper ocean measurements of the dynamic response to wind forcing, the associated inertial response, and the impacts to upper ocean shear. The proposed suite of instrumentation will provide a capability to sample both sides of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) persistently in both deep water and coastal settings circumventing the heavy logistics and cost burdens associated with ocean moorings. The mobility provided by the SV3 USV is also well suited for adaptively sampling oceanic features including fronts, eddies, and internal waves. The equipment will be used in a wide range of basic scientific studies of Naval interest including air-sea interaction and mixing in the surface wave boundary layer; growth of oceans and wave-current interaction; mapping of submesoscale oceanographic features; assessment of ocean response (including inertial) and modulation of near surface shear.

        "abstract": "Submesoscale (SMS) energy is elevated (a) on the peripheries of mesoscale features, (b) in topographic wakes, and (c) due to turbule nt thermal wind. In 2D quasigeostrophic flows, eddy kinetic energy (EKE) cascades to larger scales as small eddies coalesce. In 3D a geostrophic flows, EKE cascades to smaller scales and is dissipated as turbulence. Both occur simultaneously. Here we propose a prof iling float array for ARCTERX that contributes to quantifying downscale energy cascades from the SMS flows to determine the relative importance of internal gravity wave (IGW) and SMS currents in turbulence generation and to assess turbulence distributions in both time and space, including the role that turbulence plays in vorticity evolution and vice versa.To sustain coverage over months acros s spatial scales ranging from mesoscale eddies of O(200) km to turbulence of O(0.01-10) m, we will use an array of 15 existing SOLO- II profiling floats with CTDs and 8 Flippin Chi SOLO (FCS) floats fully instrumented with turbulence sensors and developed with ONR funding (2 exist, 6 to be constructed). This array will be deployed to attempt to quantify:1. the rate of the downscale cascade and mixing,2. turbulence generated by SMS currents in the interior, and3. coupling between SMS currents and IGWs.The float array will o btain the time-varying spatial structure of turbulence through and around an evolving SMS feature. Objective mapping of the measured density, temperature, salinity, surface velocity and depth-mean velocity fields will extend our assessment to the time-varying spic e, strain, vorticity, and divergence fields.Specifically, we propose the following contributions.1. SIO will manufacture 6 new FCS f loats with CTDs to which OSU will add an additional package that includes 2 shear probes, 2 thermistors and pitot tube for sensing t urbulence, pressure sensor, compass and 3-axis linear accelerometer package.2. 15 SOLO-II floats from FLEAT and CALYPSO are availabl e for ARCTERX. Two existing FCS floats built under ONR grant N00014-17-1-2700 require firmware upgrades for data exfiltration. These floats have already been fabricated and are ready for use in ARCTERX without further fabrication cost.3. We will deploy 5 SOLO-II a nd 5 FCS floats floats in 2023 field experiment. We intend to recover all FCS floats in 2023.4. We will develop the necessary on-boa rd processing to obviate the need for recoveries.5. We will deploy 10 SOLO-II and 8 FCS floats in 2024 field experiment. No floats w ill be recovered. These floats will be in the field for 3-12 months, depending on the mission.Budgets include construction costs of $385k (SIO) and $100k (OSU). These costs will be proposed to DURIP with the intent that they be subtracted from SIO and OSU ARCTERX budgets. Note: For clarity OSU and SIO proposals are identical since they are interdependent. Tasks are distinct and defined within . Budgets are separate.Approved for public release.less",

While significant progress\"\" has been made on fiber based high power lasers, singleaperture lasers have suffered from their limited scalability. We propose a n\"ew type of high-powersingle aperture laser based on photonic Bound state In the Continuum Surface Emitting Lasers(BICSELs). Bound\" state in the continuum (BIC), initially believed to be a mathematical curiosityin quantum mechanics, have recently been demonstrat\"ed to make lasers with unique scaling of thequality factor. BIC is a new and more efficient way to trap light in which interference in openphotonic systems in a continuum surprisingly lead to bound electromagnetic states with infinitequality factor. The scaling of BIC photonic modes enables large single apertures that in turn leadsto much higher output power compared to what has been possible so far to reach the kilowattregime at a single wafer scale. These sources will find applications in many Navy systems wherehig\"h power is required. The proposal requests $707,940 to design, fabricate, and characterize nextgeneration high-power BICSELs. The r\"\"esearch will 1) investigate the physics of high-powerBICSELs, 2) fabricate and characterize high-power BICSELs and 3) realize elect\"\"rically pumpedhigh-power BICSELs.

        "abstract": "Many applications related to the mission of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) such as hybrid composite structures for both manned and unmanned surface and underwater vessels require modeling of composite materials in the presence of multiple physical phenomena. Reliable and safe design and assessment of systems containing these materials requires advanced multiscale models and simulation tools which can accurately predict behavior and failure subject to external loading conditions. Despite progress made in discovering mechanisms behind dissipative deformations and failure in heterogeneous composite materials, e.g., defects, crack initiation and growth, brittle fracture, debonding at material interfaces and localized deformations, many questions remain unanswered regarding the sequence and interaction of various deformation and failure mechanisms, fiber-matrix interface behavior, and interactions of chemical constituents. In this project, we plan to leverage advances in materials science and artificial intelligence to develop a multiscale framework enhanced by Machine Learning (ML) techniques to reliably capture nonlinear deformations and fracture of composite laminates by linking the atomic and nano-scale mechanisms to larger scales. For this purpose, we will perform multiscale imaging of composite samples using a range of imaging techniques spanning across multiple scales, including Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and X-ray micro-CT to probe the material from atomic to nano- and micro-scales. We will develop a systematic approach for multi-scale characterization and testing of the samples using a variety of techniques such as nano-indentation and micro-indentation tests. Subsequently, we will leverage machine learning techniques to develop a scale-bridging method for linking the atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations to the continuum-scale simulations. The developed multiscale framework will be verified using experimental testresults and will be applied to study the impact of composite constituents and fiber-matrix interface on the failure mechanisms of the material.less",

Most of these ocean currents are not well represented in numerical models and are under-sampled by the global ocean observing systems, particularly near abrupt topography. Therefore, there is a pressing need for observations to improve our understanding of how these currents interact with each other and to validate numerical models. We propose to design a Lagrangian study that will deploy 160 Surface Velocity Program (SVP) drifters over three years to improve understanding and predictions of the circulation in the FLEAT region over the west Mariana Ridge. This effort will specifically address the following main science questions: - What does the existing drifter dataset reveal about interactions of the large-scale currents with regional topography? - What is the effect of the meridionally sheared westward North Equatorial Current (NEC) and eastward North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) on the generation of mesoscale eddies? - Can the island rule provide a plausible explanation for observations of currents near abrupt topography or are local forcing mechanisms providing a dynamically sound explanation?

        "abstract": "Currently deployed radios carried by servicemembers and lightweight UAVs consume significant amounts of power (e.g., the Harris PRC117G consumes 60W), leading to a significant weight burden limiting their mobility and performance. Our previous ONR-funded researchinvestigated the design of very low-power radios that can significantly ease this weight burden. Specifically, we investigated use of M-ary FSK as our modulation format, as it is theoretically power efficient and, in practice, amenable to a low-power circuit implementation. Our program resulted in a record-setting integrated circuit that could, for the first time, communicate over a distance of 1km for sub-mW power at 100kpbs for a net 100,000x improvement over the current approach. However, this multiple-order of magnitude improvement only occurs when operating in clean environments without large interferers or, more importantly, active jammers as would occur in harsh electronic warfare (EW) conditions. This is one reason why the Harris device consumes so much power. Interestingly, after a careful literature survey, we found that there are NO low-power radios targeting operation in such harsh electronic warfare conditions. Most low-power radios strive to consume as low power as possible without regard for practical interference or jamming conditions, or without regard to minimizing the probability of intercept. As a result, their tolerable signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) are very poor (e.g., -10dB at a 2MHz offset), and their ability to operate in the presence of an intelligent jammer or tominimize the probability of intercept is effectively nil. As a result, the focus of this proposal is to augment the results of the previous ONR-funded project towards operation in the harshest possible EW conditions. Fortunately, the selected modulation format ofM-ary FSK is actually well suited for extensions to frequency-hopping and dynamic channel bandwidth allocation approaches, and thuscan offer some intrinsic advantages over conventional designs. It is not easy to enable such features in a low-power manner, but our team has the right level of background and expertise to perform the necessary cross-layer optimization to retain our multiple order of magnitude power reduction over conventional approaches, all while enabling extremely robust operation for EW. This proposal is responding primarily to Technical Area 5. Our primary objective is to enable robust communication across a distance of 1km at a datarate of 100kbps with as low power as possible in both the transmit and receive units. We anticipate retaining our 100,000x power advantage over radios like the Harris one, but in this case with equivalent anti-jam (AJ) and low-probability of intercept (LPI) capabilities. Compared to the low-power radio space, we will improve our signal-to-interference ratio, AJ, and PLI capabilities by >1,000x. These radios could also be relevant to operation in small geographic areas, as described in TA1.less",

We propose large eddy simulation (LES) of the coupled system, the ocean surface boundary layer and the marine atmospheric boundary layer, in order to identify turbulence flow physics whose misrepresentation would lead to biases in coupled models. Several science questions will be addressed: the role of laterally advected fresh/saline water in maintaining or dissipating the ASMWP, the robustness of the diurnal warm layer (DWL) to wind variability at multiple scales and the rectified effect of the DWL, the role of subsurface thermal inversions, and the influence of synoptic changes in the atmosphere on the coupled system. The simulations will be conducted at high resolution of the energetic scales of motion, with an adaptive subgrid model for the smallest turbulence scales, with modern fluxtreatment at the air-sea interface, with Langmuir circulation on the ocean side, and with representation of the moisture budget andits role in heat transport on the air side. As in previous ONR DRIs, we anticipate collaborative efforts with other PIs to help interpret observations, run LES with conditions steered by observations and large-scale GCMs, help improve turbulence parameterization in the deployed large-scale models and answer science questions as they manifest during the DRI.less",

ONR experiments involve moorings, free-swimming vehicles, over-the side instruments, and near-bottom cabled instruments in areas where detailed seafloor bathymetry and backscatter imagery is vital for operational success and scientific progress.Recently-completed and ongoing examples include ASIAEX, NLIWI, ITOP, QPE, PhilEx, IWISE, ASIRI, FLEAT, PISTON and MISO-BOB, with similar needs anticipated for future DRIs. The proposed echosounder will also strongly benefit the educational missions of SIO and ONR, by its routine use during SIO class deployments, student-led projects supported by the UC Ship Funds Program, and ONR-supported educational projects such as In The Footsteps of Roger Revelle.A deep-water multibeam echosounders is a primary instrument for many ONR-supported users of global class research vessels, and a secondary instrument for most others, and as such is a vital tool. Roger Revelle???s existing hardware has reached the end of its service life, and impedance measurements of the transmit array show that individual elements are failing in a manner that is consistent with progressive age-related failure indicative of impending end-of-life. The array must be replaced. The timing of this request is intended to coincide with the upcoming midlife refit of Roger Revelle, during which we intend to install a gondola that will house the ship???s acoustic transducers in order to improve sonar performance. The gondola we intend to install aboard will house the deep-water transducer arrays and most of the ship???s other acoustic sensors, and thus will require that the existing transmit and receive arrays, and all associated cabling and housings, be removed from their existing locations in the hull and moved into the gondola.

        "abstract": "The proposed work involves harnessing adaptive signal processing with geometric feature extraction and sophisticated ~big data~ mac\"hine learning techniques to track, interpret, and learn potentially intertwined signatures of diverse oceanic events in shallow water acoustics. Oceanic phenomenaof interest include but are not limited to multipath acoustic scattering, Doppler effect from fluid motion and moving reflectors in the ocean, high-energy transient events such as surface wave focusing, constructive multipath interference, structured ambient noise, etc. To achieve this end, This proposal is in response to the challenges raised at the Tactical Oceanography Symposium in mid October, 2018. The overall objective of this 3-year research project (spanning 4 federal fiscal years) is to quantitatively evaluate the properties of the underwater sound field ~ both signal and noise - and quantitatively relate these propertiesto the characteristics of the environment. The ultimate goal is to determine theenvironmental limits to the achievable gains (array gain and processing gain) in the passive sonar equation. The proposed effort has a seagoing experimental component, an in-depth data analysis and numerical modeling component, a publication component, and a transition component. The location of the proposed sea test is west of San Diego, CA in proximity to station locations in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation program (Figs. 1 and 2) where extensive, high quality oceanographic and biological data have been collected since 1951. Its objective is to simultaneously measure the underwater acoustic field - both with and without controlled signals present ~ over oceanographically and biologically relevant time scales (greater than one season), across as wide an acoustic frequency band (5 Hz to 40 kHz), with as great a spatial diversity (at least 6 different sites), and as fine a directional estimation capability (up to 12-elem hydrophone arrays at LF and up to 4-elem hydrophone arrays at HF) as existing data acquisition systems and resources will allow, in an area well characterized by ongoing oceanographic and biological measurement programs. The basic science/signal processing research effort in this proposed program will be conducted mostly by twoScripps (SIO) graduate students, Camille Pagniello and Kelley McBride, under the supervision of their co-advisors Dr. Jules Jaffe, Prof. Mike Buckingham, and Dr. Gerald D~Spain. Results will be published in peer-reviewed papers and the students~ Ph.D. theses. Transition of fleet-relevant results will be coordinated via ONR Code 32 t\"o the relevant U.S. Navy activities, including Undersea Warfighting Development Center (UWDC) in San Diego.less",

        "abstract": "This abstract is publicaly releasable. Feddersens objectives are to use field observations to study the physics of and validate models of coastal ocean dynamical processes important to Navy operations, in particular on rocky coastlines. About 75% of the world coastlines are rocky, limiting Naval accessibility. In contrast to well-studied sandy shores, rocky shores have complex three-dimensional geometries at scales of cm to 100s m, are often exposed to strong waves, and relatively little is known about their wave and circulation dynamics. Rocky shore ocean dynamics are inherently multi-scale. Multi-scale bottom variability (or roughness) has strong effects on wave processes such as scattering, reflection, nonlinear energy transfers, and dissipation that are dramatically different than on sandy beaches. Rocky shore wave processes also strongly affect water-column turbulence and wave-driven currents (rip currents, undertow). The accuracy of existing models developed for low-sloped beaches in predicting rocky shores wave propagation, circulation and turbulence is unknown, nor is what new physics must be included to make accurate predictions. Synchronous arrays with spatial lags from 1-1000 m are required to observe coherent wave processes, yet previously used methods are costly and logistically hazardous on complex rocky shores, requiring a new approach. This DURIP proposal is associated with a MURI Program, ONR Topic 3: Littoral ocean dynamics off of rocky coasts and shorelines submission by a PI team led by MacMahan (NPS), which proposes field experiments on representative rocky shores, and modeling of wave, circulation, and turbulence processes. We propose to develop a Rocky Shorelines Wave, Currents, & Turbulence Coherent Observing System to coherently measure these processes over 1-1000 m scales, advance rocky shores observational capability, and allow use of new statistical approaches. The PI, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will utilize this system in research, publications, and presentations. The proposed system includes: Phoenix Lidar SCOUT-32 UAS lidar system with a Harris Aerial Carrier H6 UAS (US-made), an IMU, a 32-beam Velodyne HDL-32 lidar, and optical camera to coherently measure the 2D water surface elevation and wave breaking including swash over time. This enables observations in complex regions and slopes difficult to access; Spotter Buoy Synchronous Wave Sampling Array made up of 15 solar-powered Spotter directional wave buoys (with GPS & DoD Iridium) each with SMART cables, and RBR Coda bottom-mounted pressure sensors all on GPS time to coherently measure sea-swell and infragravity wave transformation (shoaling, scattering, nonlinear energy transfers, and dissipation). The lack of cross-buoy cabling allows for versatility in array design and reduces logistical costs for the multiple proposed MURI experiments; and Current Meter Wave/Current/Turbulence Array made up of 4 bottom-mounted Nortek Signature 1000 acoustic current profilers to measure directional wave transformation, wave-induced circulation patterns, and water column turbulence. These Signatures will also be GPS time-synced enabling coherent observations.less",

Existing algorithms generally leave individual systems unprotected against powerful adversaries who can have access to data, the output of algorithms,and internal network structure. While there has been a great e -ort to make multi-agent and control systems resilient against different attaks of sub-classes of adversaries, no much work exists to make individual these assets oblivious to a data breach in the system. In addition, safe data-handling has to be juxtaposed with the apparent contradiction of designing both useful and robust learningalgorithms that can be effectively used in fast decision-making scenarios for multiple agents.The proposed research will establish fundamental theory and algorithms that will help tune a desired balance between the preservation of data integrity and the effectiveness of high-confidence, data-based decision-making algorithms for autonomous systems. To do this, we will formulate estimation and decision-making problems for multiple agents in a distributional setting. On theone hand, this will allow us to ?nd novel conditions to naturally tune the differential privacy of assets or agents participating in an algorithmic process. On the other hand, the same framework will serve to develop new robust algorithms that can be used for the assimilation of data in time-varyingscenarios with performance guarantees. As a byproduct, a new class of Monte-Carlo estimation and distributed learning algorithms will be designed.less",

        "abstract": "The long-term goal of this project is to observe and improve understanding of the physics of rapid dynamical, thermodynamic, and acoustical changes in the upper ocean during and following periods of strong surface forcing. The ice-free high-latitude oceans are subjected to a wide range of forcing conditions. Wind forcing, freshwater forcing, and surface heat fluxes are all highly variable, over both the seasonal time scale and the weather timescale. For example, wind speeds in the ice-free high-latitude oceans can go fr om almost zero to gale force in a matter of hours. Strong atmospheric forcing is reflected in rapid changes within the ocean bound ary layer. Many of those changes including mixed layer (surface duct) deepening, variability in turbulence and mixing, and the stir ring of temperature, salinity on isopycnalsimpact the patterns of acoustic transmission loss in the upper ocean, especially at midf requencies. In regions with elevated salinity stratification, like the Arctic, the effect of strong forcing on shallow mixed layers is complex in space and time, and occurs on small scales. The high-latitude ocean environment poses additional, unique challenges. T he strong forcing, the role of salinity in stratification and sound speed, the small size of mesoscale eddies, and even the sporadic performance of magnetic compasses all complicate the observation of surface forcing and upper-ocean response. This proposal is dire ctly targeted at meeting these challenges with an innovative observational platform that has been jointly developed by groups at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) under ONR funding. This is a propos al to continue development of a novel drogued buoy platform for air-sea interaction measurements, incorporating a high-quality, low- cost surface meteorological package (WHOI) and a subsurface profiling instrument package driven by ocean waves (SIO) in order to pro vide real-time measurements of surface meteorology, air-sea fluxes, and the physical and biooptical properties of the upper several hundred meters of the water column. We will adapt our previous design in two new directions for NORSE: (1) we will build two small e xpeditionary drogued buoys to provide key real-time measurements about surface and subsurface conditions in a relatively easy-to-dep loy and low-cost package, (2) we will refurbish and assemble two larger drogued buoys to provide research quality measurements on th e surface forcing and ocean evolution of key physical and bio-optical properties during the planned IOPs.

We will use the MIT general circulation model and its adjoint-based four-dime nsional variational assimilation (MITgcm-4DVAR) system. An outer parent model with a horizontal resolution of 1/12o (9 km) and 50 ve rtical levels covering the northwestern Pacific Ocean will be implemented to estimate/predict the large-scale regional circulation b y initializing using HYCOM/NCODA global analysis and adjusting initial conditions, boundary conditions and atmospheric forcings to m atch the data over one to three months.We will nest data-assimilative models into the large-scale model with increased resolution fo r horizontal grid scales down to 1/96o (1.2 km), and perhaps below, depending on the physics and on the observations available, and will be using shorter correlation lengths for the control adjustment and shorter assimilation windows. In addition to observations f rom global ocean observing system, we will assimilate the experimental data and produce reanalysis before, during, and after the fie ldwork. We will compute adjoint sensitivities of key circulation features to both local and remote ocean-atmospheric forcing. Specif ic science questions to be addressed:What are the characteristics of the three-dimensional structure of meso/sub-mesoscale eddies i n the proposed study region? Understanding the unique dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the eddies will quantify eddy net heat and mass transport. How do the model sub-grid scale parametrizations affect the sub-mesoscale energy cascade? Using different sub- grid scale parametrizations in high-resolution models will help to examine the mesoscale/sub-mesoscale energy cascade.What are the temporal and spatial scales of the sub-mesoscale cascade in the proposed study region? The spatial-temporal scales of the processes define the assimilation period and predictability times. Understanding the model errors/limitations: Model errors due to unresolved physics and parameterizations will cause representational error and limit the assimilation time. A key research goal is for an opti mal choice of assimilation window that produces skillful analysis and forecasts.We will be updating our existing 1/6o model for the northwestern Pacific (developed for the OKMC and FLEAT ONR DRIs) to 1/120 and will be nesting high-resolution submodels into 1/120 m odel. Using this 1/6o model, we performed state estimation/prediction experiments and produced skillful hindcasts and forecasts, dem onstrating the capabilities of the MITgcm-4DVAR system for the proposed study region.

Large amplitude, nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) can induce st,rong currents, upwell dense water high in nutrients, and also affect marine operations and acoustic communications.The processes tha,t determine generation and propagation of NLIWs have been the focus of extensive research. The bulk of work addressing NLIW transfor,mation as they interact with topography, including shoaling and breaking, has largely focused on 2D topography. A number of remote s,ensing studies have noted significant redirection of NLIW energy associated with steep 3D topography, however. The dynamics of NLIW,refraction around steep features is not yet well-understood.Here, we propose to explore processes that determine NLIW transformation, over steep, 3D topography - including refraction, shoaling and reflection along with the implications of these processes on the i,nternal wave environment at larger scales. The broad objective for the project is to improve forecasting and predictability for nonl,inear internal waves in the ocean. The proposed work will make use of high resolution numerical simulations combined with analysis o,f existing observational data to examine the effects of wave characteristics, flow history, local internal tides and changes in rota,tion on NLIW transformation and on subsequent generation of residual circulation and trapped baroclinic energy.Results from the nume,rical experiments will be used to guide a set of focused field observations to be carried out at Dongsha Atoll, a steep, nearly circ,ular feature in the South China Sea. Extensive work has previously been carried out on NLIWs in this region, where some of the large,st internal waves on the planet have been observed. The modeling work and field observations build on long-standing collaborative ef,forts between the project PIs, Taiwanese colleagues and other ONR supported researchers.

However, limited in-situ observations of this rapid evolution make it unclear how to adequately parametrize these physical properties of the upper ocean based on the environmental variables. In this project we propose to add to two critical upgrades to our Towed Acoustic Modules for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (TAM-ASV, ONR-funded): 1) Installing low-drag towed bodies to optimize the acoustic performance of the TAM-ASV to minimize the impact of self-noise from the ASV and also by using a vibration-insulating umbilical tether allows for two-way communication (including transfer and time-synchronization using the GPS Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) of the acoustic recording from the vector sensor) between the towed-body and the ASV as well as electrical power transfer. 2) Implementing high frequency acoustic transponders (akin to a USBL system) to continuously geo-localize the TAM-ASV with high-accuracy with respect to the GPS antenna of the ASV; this will ultimately enable all acoustic and physical oceanography measurements to be jointly accurately geolocated. Those transponders also have telemetry capabilities providing a means to test the performance of underwater communications between the upgraded TAM-ASVs under various configurations in the fluctuating upper ocean. Perhaps more importantly, deploying several of these upgraded TAM-ASVs can be used emulate the operations of a small swarm of actual autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to investigate the use of joint acoustic coherent processing as well as adaptive swarming behaviors for improving the detection and tracking of low-frequency sources in a potentially complex propagation environment.

The size of acoustic dataset will be reduced by recording samples of ocea n noise at times when they will be most significantly correlated with local sound sources. While the acoustic sampling will be non-c ontinuous, the clear advantage of working with expendable instruments is that they dont need to be recovered to access the data and therefore large areas can be sampled for synoptically for longer times under a variety of meteorological conditions, when probable generation mechanisms and promising noise sources are sensed by our specialized instruments. Dense mesoscale to sub-mesoscale resol ving arrays will be deployed during two observing periods. The data from these dense sensor arrays will reveal both the relative rol es of the forcing factors, buoyancy versus mechanical surface mixing, as well as the vertical structure of the upper-ocean stratific ation as it evolves along surface current structures. If needed, our drifter-based sensing arrays can be sustained beyond intense ob serving periods using charter vessels and aircrafts.

The comprehensive approach combines synthesis of nanostructures using thin film (Sputtering and MBE) and lithography (electron beam and self-assembly) techniques, characterization using quantitative surface analytical, scanning probe microscopy, high-resolution quantitative X-ray scattering and microscopy techniques and measurement of physical properties (steady state and fast time dependent magnetotransport, and magnetooptical). To synthesize a number of materials which only exist in a narrow phase space we will use a unique gas evolution technique which is able to control and follow very precisely P-T phase diagram of particular oxides, fluorides and hydrides. It is also important to highlight that defects are usually prevalent in these type of complex materials and therefore understanding their effects on the physical properties is essential and will be addressed in all cases. All synthesis of unique strongly correlated materials, preparation of nanostructured devices and structural and physical characterization are performed in the PI\u2019s laboratory at UCSD. We have established a battery of state of the art instrumentation and continue expanding our experimental capabilities at UCSD to assure that this will produce new basic research and new device concepts.less",

        "abstract": "Marine mammals, particularly beaked whales, are of concern to the US Navy in regard to noise impacts during naval training exercises. To successfully quantify behavioral responses to noise and potential short- and long-term impacts, it is essential to track individuals and their behaviors under natural as well as disturbed circumstances. Behavioral responses caused by naval sound sources, especially mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), will likely be dependent upon the behavioral state of an individual. This behavioral state in turn is often driven by the underlying environmental conditions which determine prey distributions as a driver for beaked whale presence. Proposed is the procurement of two passive-active acoustic tracking (PAAT) moorings to conduct predator-prey and noise impact studies. They are designed to determine how oceanographic conditions influence prey abundance and distribution and consequently predator foraging behavior and habitat use with a focus on beaked whales. The data to be collected with this type of mooring can be analyzed on an individual level, but also serve to develop behavioral and habitat models. With it, we can begin to incorporate ecosystem-based management practices to mitigate noise impacts on marine mammals, specifically beaked whales, caused by US Navy training operations. Each of the two moorings consists of two four-channel High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARP, Scripps Oceanographic of Oceanography), one situated near the seafloor and the other at 300 m water depth. Two upward looking wideband autonomous transceivers (WBAT, Simrad) and transducers with a nominal frequency of 70 kHz that are capable of sweeping from 55 to 90 kHz will be placed near the seafloor and at 400 m water depth. Two conductivity-temperature-depth recorders with oxygen sensors (SeaBird SBE 37SMP-ODO) will be installed close to the active acoustic components.less",

        "abstract": "Despite important advances in designing distributed coordination, cooperation, and decision-making algorithms, multi-agent networks have proven fragile to targeted attacks, as local and well-orchestrated actions have rapidly cascaded into network-wide destructive perturbations. This has been demonstrated both in academic research and by real-world events. Given the paramount importance that resilience plays in the autonomous operation of network systems, novel theories, methodologies, and tools are critically needed. We need notions that characterize network resilience and allow us to understand strengths and vulnerabilities against adversaries. Obtaining such characterizations is difficult because resilience and performance are complex functions of the network's and adversary's capabilities, knowledge, and resources, the interconnection structure, and the physical limitations on remedial and adversarial actions. At the same time, we also need novel design methodologies that protect multi-agent networks and adaptively manage their interconnection over time to achieve performance guarantees in military missions with a high degree of uncertainty, complexity, and time urgency. The goal of this project it to assess and control resiliency of networks by providing ways to measure it, identify vulnerabilities and areas of improvement, and leverage time-varying actuation and interconnection to develop novel resiliency-enhancing control methodologies. This project seeks to address challenges posed by a diversity of scenarios affecting the secure operation of multi-agent networks against strategic adversaries, such as the availability of information to individual agents and to the network designer, offline versus online operation, the impact of changes in the network state and the environment, and tradeoffs of centralized versus distributed computation. We are particularly interested in developing metrics, tools, and methods to enhance resilience that account for scenarios with partial, local, or incomplete knowledge and leverage time-varying actuation and network topologies. Understanding and taking advantage of this requires measures of resiliency for both static and dynamic networks and efficient ways to compute them. The expected outcomes of the project are understanding of fundamental trade-offs between resiliency and attack/defense capabilities in multi-agent networks; the identification of structural principles that help make network resilient in linear and nonlinear scenarios; and design guidelines and control strategies for attack detection and network adaptation that take advantage of time-varying actuation and interconnection. An increased understanding of the key factors that determine network resilience promises to be of significant impact in a wide range of scenarios. Prior to mission deployment, by providing critical insights and guidance as to how to structure network interactions and how to react to specific types of attacks. During missing deployment, by providing novel distributed computational procedures to re-assess resilience and endowing networks with adaptive control methodologies that take advantage of time-varying actuation of agent nodes, clusters, and interconnections.less",

We are motivated by progress in materials science that has transitioned from initial and limited control of composition a few decades ago, to the current control of composition and feature sizes at the micro- and nano-scales, and propose that the next paradigm for the development of advanced ceramic materials requires precise control of shape. We propose to develop a new class of ceramics of controlled architectures, based on ultrahigh temperature TaC, HfC, and ZrC composites. These materials are of interest for a variety of applications. For example, we hypothesize that controlled architectures enhance creep resistance because of the mechanical interlocking of the grains within the material\u2014an effect which has been studied in textured architectures of metallic materials, but has never been explored in ceramics due to difficulties in manufacturing. They cannot be extruded, for example, which is the common method used for producing textured metal alloys. In advancing this concept, this will be the first study to explore and manufacture bulk ceramics of unique architectures allowing comparisons between tiled carbide systems and currently available spheroidal morphologies.

As an internal physical mechanism to amplify weak signals such as photocurrent at much higher efficiency and lower noise than any known mechanisms, the discovery of CEP effect is a major scientific accomplishment in condensed matter physics and holds promise to transform the fields of optical imaging and communication.The proposed research takes advantage of the unique characteristics of the CEP effect, in combination with other mechanisms for signal amplification and light matter interactions, to address key technology concerns for uncooled SWIR detectors. The research is particularly focused on development of effective methods to incorporate the CEP effect into practical devicesto produce high performance, scalable designs for next generation SWIR detectors. Among the main challenges include technologies that can support efficient electron transport over the ordered/disordered material interface since ordered, crystalline materials are efficient for photon absorption but both theory and experiment have suggested that the CEP effect is strongest in disordered materials such as amorphous semiconductors. Innovative approaches have been proposed to solve the carrier transport problem over the heterointerface between ordered and disordered materials.

        "abstract": "(a) Research Objectives The goal of this research program is to gain mechanistic understanding of the dynamics and assembly of porous, self-assembled materials, specifically metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). A variety of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques including environmental (ETEM), liquid cell (LCTEM), and other related methods will allow for the study of these materials in real time. These in situ TEM methods are highly innovative and cutting-edge, such that the methods developed and used in this program will enable the study of other porous materials. The data obtained in these experiments will be performed in parallel with theoretical simulations to identify the structure of the materials, determine molecular driving forces, and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms. (b) Methods and Specific Aims The methods to be employed in this program involve the use of in situ TEM methods to monitor the nucleation, growth, and phase transitions of MOFs and polyMOFs. These methods are suitable for the proposed studies and will allow us to achieve the following specific aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. To observe and theoretically model the formation of MOFs. 2. Specific Aim 2. To observe and develop theoretical models for the expansion of MOFs by postsynthetic exchange (PSE). 3. Specific Aim 3. To observe and develop theoretical models for the formation and morphology of polyMOFs. (c) Significance of Proposed Activities The proposed initiative will focus on the fundamental science around MOFs to better understand growth, postsynthetic exchange processes, and the formation of polymer hybrids (i.e. polyMOFs). MOFs show great potential as advanced materials. They have been heavily investigated as sorbents for gases, supports for catalysts, and for use as porous conductors. The use of advanced in situ TEM methods will permit characterization of these materials in real time with unprecedented resolution. The team we have assembled has is interdisciplinary, with a strong track record of collaboration and publication together, using both theory and experiment. This approach has so far provided for a productive research team focused on the development of new methods, and new porous materials. Ultimately, the experimental and theoretical methods developed in this program will enable our team to study other, high-value porous materials, including covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), and polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs).less",

        "abstract": "The overall project goal is to develop a portable, low cost, low power, underwater current meter that will estimate current velocity accurately in a large variety of ocean environments when deployed from a variety of fixed or moving platforms using ambient particle imaging andtracking methods. Targeted platforms include both moored and vertically profiling, and moving platforms as AUVs, gliders, and ROVs. Our approach has been piloted via the development of a low cost (< $500) sensor package that uses inexpensive, commercially available, components.Results indicate that the system works well in measuring near bottom currents parallel to the face of the enclosing cylindrical housing compared to an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter that was simultaneously deployed. We seek funds to further develop an instrument that will have minimal flow disturbance and the necessary sensitivity and processing power to yield identical results to the popular Doppler based products in a large range of environments. To accomplish this we will work with our partner company, Creare (Hanover, NH) that has expertise in ParticleImaging Velocimetry and optical system design. Our plan is to explore several designs that: (1) Use multiple cameras to facilitate larger separation as well as a range of configurations that more closely mimic the geometry of the Doppler systems. (2) Use laser diodes that will provide two orders of magnitude higher irradiance on the small particles to insure system function in a range of environments where the smaller particles dominate. (3) Use frame straddling techniques to circumvent the relatively slow camera frame rate to achieve current estimates in flows as high as 2 m/s, compatible with AUV velocities. Our plan encompasses an initial design phase followed by building several lab prototypes to mimic the new geometry and lighting. Tests with calibrated spheres as well as natural particles in filtered seawater will permit an accurate estimate of system performance in our flume. Improved processing algorithms, tailored to the new geometry, will be developed by Creare. Upon examining the merits of the systems we will decide on a seagoing version that will be packaged and tested in Year 2 via vertical profiles in local waters on the R/V Sproul and on a vertical profiling platform such as the wire walker. Comparisons with the Doppler methods, both ADV and ADCP will be used to validate the estimated in situ flow speed and direction. Upon successful trials, our partner, Creare, will fabricate 10 units in Year 2. Sea trials and calibrations with all units will then take place at the end of Year 2. In year 3, the 10 synchronized units will be deployed in an opportunistic area that exhibits complex flow due to complex bottom terrain. Overall working characteristics will be a unit that can estimate flow from 0 to 2 m/s with reasonable performance errors, consume less than 3W of power, and be adaptable to a variety of platforms. A unique aspect of the optically based velocimeter is that it can measure the 3-dimensional spatial characteristics of flow within the laser sheet allowing observation of small-scale turbulence. Another advantage is that the optical port can be smoothly integrated into the exterior of autonomous vehicles, thereby introducing minimal flow disturbance in their performanceless",

        "abstract": "analogous to electronic components, promises to realize quantum sensors for position, navigation,and timing (PNT) with orders of magnitude better performance than their classical counterparts.However, this vision has been an elusive dream for almost 20 years with the so-far exploredmagnetic trapping platforms. We propose a transformational advance to realize atomtronic devicesthat fulfill their promises.This project will develop the foundations of a novel class of quantum devices based oncircuits of matter-waves of strontium that are trapped, controlled, and guided by the evanescentfields of underlying photonic nanowaveguide circuits. Strontium atoms will be trapped by twocolorevanescent fields emanating from the top of nanowaveguides. These two fields causerepulsive and attractive forces on the atoms and their distinct decay lengths, when combined, willlead to the formation of a local sharp potential minimum at 200 nm from the top surface of thewaveguide, for reasonable powers of a few to ten mW of light guided in the waveguides. Bychoosing both fields to be magic wavelengths for a microKelvin-cooling transition, and using lasercooling techniques unique to strontium, we anticipate high phase-space densities, natural modematching,and continuous loading into the atomtronic device. Strontium's mass-88 isotope enablesa 100-times reduction below the rubidium value of dephasing atom-atom interactions, afundamental limit on the matter-wave spatiotemporal coherence. Furthermore, strontium's nonmagnetic/electric singlet ground state eliminates magnetic/electric field sensitivity.Pristine nanophotonic potentials, leading to long-lived matter-wave coherence andsensitivity, are feasible through a novel state-of-the-art aluminum-nitride (AlN) nanowaveguideplatform suitable for the blue-wavelength spectrum, as required for strontium. High qualityepitaxial AlN enables low-loss photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and high-Q optical resonatorsoperating deeper into the short wavelengths than amorphous waveguide materials, such as siliconnitride, and are more immune to parasitic nonlinear effects such as two-photon absorption andphotothermal phenomena.In this project we will develop high Q multi-wavelength micro-ring resonators and newhighly-efficient grating couplers unique for trapping and manipulating strontium atoms. Thesedevices and a fully-developed ultra-high vacuum cold-atom apparatus with a load-lock and brightstrontium source will crucially enable a tightly integrated rapid design-prototype test cycle. Wewill trap matter-waves of strontium on the evanescent fields of micro-ring resonators, and usingBragg pulses, split them into counterrotating matter-waves, and recombine them to observe matterwaveinterference. Upon rotation of the apparatus, the observed gyroscopic effect will be the basisfor a paradigm-shifting class of trapped-atom PIC devices for PNT.This platform provides unique flexibility in designing complex trapping potentials andperfect matching of any optical field to manipulate and probe the matter waves. Thesebreakthroughs are the incubating steps towards the long-term goal of realizing photonic-integratedatomtronic PNT devices with unsurpassed precision, compactness, and robustness with allcomponents on-chip, including: lasers, cold-atom sources feeding atom-laser sources, sensors,simulators, and computers based on matter-wave interference.less",

        "abstract": "The effective response to damage directly affects a naval vessel and its crew#s survivability, resilience, and readiness. Effectiveemergency response, such as damage control and firefighting, depends on shipboard personnel preparedness, timely decisions, and appropriate actions. However, damage control can only be successfully achieved when individuals in the entire chain of command have relevant, real-time information about not only the hazard but also each sailor and his/her surroundings that best support each of theirunique responsibilities. The type and granularity of information can differ between sailors of different roles. Relevant information can include self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) oxygen level, body and ambient temperatures, physical activity, health, and sailor location in each ship compartment.This project, SHEPHERD # Sensing Health, Environment, and Performance Holistically during Emergency Response and Damage-control, aims to integrate on-body devices withdevice-free sensing and advanced data analytics for local and command view of sailor performance and safety. Specifically, the goal is to develop high-performance nanocomposite and commercial off-the-shelf environmental sensors, which are seamlessly integrated with existing damage control and personal protective equipment (e.g., SCBA harness unit), to measure the health, activities, locations, performance, and surrounding conditions of shipboard personnel during damage control and emergency response. By building and integrating sensors with existing damage control equipment, sailors are not burdened with wearing additional devices. In addition, the sensing streams can be wirelessly transmitted to fixed receivers that are fully integrated with the ship telecommunications cyber-physical infrastructure for seamless information flow. A suite of different tests, ranging from laboratory human subject tests to simulated indoor shipboard environment tests to Fire Academy drill tests, will be performed to verify, validate, and demonstrate system capabilities, priming the technology for further technological advancement and development by the end of this two-year project. Overall, the proposed SHEPHERD sensing hardware and data fusion, analytics, and visualization software will enable new capabilities for the U.S. Navy and will provide individuals across the entire damage control battle organization and ship leadership with total situational awareness of shipboard personnel during an emergency. When disaster occurs, it will enable leadership, scene leaders, and damage controlmen to make effective decisions rapidly in orderto achieve well-directed, effectively coordinated, and properly prioritized actions of damage control and emergency response, thereby enhancing ship and crew survivability, resilience, and readiness.less",

The systems will be environmentally packaged to withstand all weather conditions, powered by an off-grid renewable energy system, and provided with redundant satellite communications (SATCOMS). Funds are also sought to procure a high-resolution multibeam sonar capable of being operated from small boats to map the seafloor to depths of 200m. The requested equipment will be used as part of ONR\u2019s Flow Encountering Abrupt Topography (FLEAT) Department Research Initiative (DRI). In this program, the systems will be deployed in the western tropical Pacific to study interactions between steep topography and the surrounding oceanography. In particular, studies of the interaction of the North Equatorial Current with ridge and island topography; wind driven circulation as it approaches barrier reefs from the offshore, propagation of coastal trapped waves around islands and atoll/barrier reef systems; island-scale circulation and their boundary layers, and topographic interactions with barotropic and baroclinic tides. The HF radar will be used to generate time-series maps of the circulation and the multibeam sonar will be used to generate high resolution bathymetric maps of topography over which the circulation flows at the study sites. This instrumentation suite benefits the Navy as the studies in which the instrumentation will be used will improve the validation of operational forecast models to support the Naval Oceanographic Office and will develop and demonstrate tools for rapid seabed mapping that is of interest to the Fleet Survey Team. Furthermore, improved forecast skill of surface currents will improve mine-drift tactical decision aides; a general interest of the Naval Mine and Anti- Submarine Command (NMAWC).less",

This method requires tightly-synchronized instrumentation across large distances, and computationally intensive waveform inversions. In addition to affecting sound velocities, ocean conditions also alter the frequency content of broadband signals through frequency-dependent acoustic absorption, scattering and interference. Deep learning algorithms are effective pattern recognition tools which may be ble to leverage information contained in the frequency content of received signals to make inferences aboutlocal oceanographic conditions, if trained on large numbers of observations. An existing dataset of thousands of broadband acoustic recordings of vessel passages in a shipping channel off of Southern California from 2014 to 2018, with coincident temperature and saliniy profiles, provides an opportunity to investigate the feasibility of this approach. The proposed project will explore the use of deep neural networks to make inferences about local ocean conditions based on received characteristics of vessel signatures as acoustic sources of opportunity, supplemented by AIS-derived vessel descriptions. The proposed project will potentially identify a method for estimating in situ water column properties using passive acoustic data collected at a single, non-profiling sensor location using opportunistic sound sources. The ability to estimate local water column properties using a passive acoustic point sensor would allow these properties to be measured more widely, inexpensively, and frequently than currently feasibl\"e with traditional methods.less",

        "abstract": "A sensor has data to send to a human observer. In the present case the sensor is a camera, and the data consists of an image. When commanded to do so, the image is heavily compressed, passed to the modem, and sent by robust, low data rate acommsgateway, then to the observer. The sensor system retains the uncompressed image in a file. If the observer finds the (compressed/decompressed) image to be of interest, an AUV (EMATT) is directed to move to the near vicinity of the sensor, and command anacoustic upload of the original image file. The vehicle then physically returns to the vicinity of the gateway, and responds to a command to upload its data. It is anticipated that the upload processes will use high speed data links. The Phase 1 effort identified four areas requiring analysis or development to support the concept:1. Identify significant features of targets and clutter objects which appeal to human identification.2. Define algorithmic approaches to extract those features into an image which can be compressed for acoustic transmission. Prototype one approach and demonstrate performance with a recorded image.3. Evaluate alternative methods permitting very shallow water operations with EMATT, to include depth control and vectoring.4. Determine and implement modem protocols to enable data uplink. There are three related items with which we are familiar: the ONR AOFNC program, the ONR Very Shallow Water/Surf Zone MCM program, and the ONR/SPAWAR Telesonar/DADS program. The AOFNC is run by Dr. Tom Curtin, as is this proposed Data Truck STTR.Benthos, under subcontract to Sippican for the AOFNC, is tasked to develop an underwater GPS for geo-positioning of multiple undersea vehicles. This project will use the ATM 88x family of modems to transmit and receive the underwater signals. The MUSBLdescribed here and in the Phase One Final Report is a different form of positioning/navigation system, but both could be available in one modem, and could share many of the same algorithms and hardware resources. Furthermore, some of the upgrades plannedfor EMATT under this proposal will benefit the AOFNC effort, especially with regard to the ability to provide acoustic C2, depth control.The image processing efforts are especially important to the CSS crawler developments for MCM, and, indeed, much of the MCM money available for image processing has been targeted as matching funds for this STTR program. Finally, the proposed enhancementsto the Benthos high speed modem will directly benefit the Telesonar/DADS program by providing high data rate transfer of large volumes of data, when such is found to be necessary. We also believe the core data truck will be highly effective as a collectorof data in a dense network of sensors and modems, such as DADS.less",

The goal of the proposed activities will be to address and answer outstanding questions concerning biomolecular interactions with geochemical surfaces and the transformation of biomolecules on geochemical surfaces.

Specifically, the adsorption of proteins and DNA on oxides, oxyhydroxides, clays and carbonates will be probed using different analytical techniques to develop a better understanding of how minerals with different surface properties, such as surface charge and binding sites etc., change these interactions. The second objective is to investigate the surface chemistry and transformation of biomolecules to determine how these surface-biomolecular interactions impact biomolecule transformations.

The equipment aims to close the loop of robotic learning from data acquisition, deep learning, to automatic control in unmanned vehicles. Recent technological advances in embedded sensing and computation have enabled massive real-time sensor data for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). For example, the 2 Mail Delivery Vehicles alone with 8 cameras at co-PI Christensen's generate 2 Terabytes of data per day [1]. The UAVs and UGVs in co-PI Atanasov's lab (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) are equipped with various sensors (Fig. 5), generating spatiotemporal data including thermal, RGB, and depth images and inertial and range measurements. In addition to the raw sensor data, there is also processed data generated by the computer vision and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms (Fig. 1). Furthermore, high-fidelity simulators such as CARLA [2] also produce considerable amount of simulation data for various scenes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a high-performance GPU/CPU cluster to process and analyze such spatiotemporal data. The proposed equipment will have a significant impact on PI Yu' s current ARO grant# W9 l 1NF-20-1-0334: \"Physics-Guided Learning for Sample Efficient Spatiotemporal Decision Making\", as well as the work by co-Pis Christensen and Atanasov's participation in the ARL Distributed and Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Technology (DCIST), Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA), and many areas of interests to DoD.

The end goal will be to build and measure practicalprototype surfaces that provide quantitative advantages for reducing the effects of microwave directed energy weapons, and that can be transitioned to emerging Navy platforms. Photonic topological insulators provide the new capability of unidirectional propagation, where waves can only travel forward and are not easily scattered into the backward direction. With the emergence of this new field, numerous ideas have become possible that have applications tocounter directed energy weapons (C-DEW) in the microwave regime. Many of these are enabled by adding nonlinear or active components. Expected advancements include:1. Designing topological structures that forbid wave propagation in a particular direction,for preventing ingress into a metallic enclosure or cavity. This can make use of the recently demonstrated concept of magnet-less nonreciprocal structures.2. Using nonlinear devices to create self-induced topological transitions, where the application of a high-power signal induces a change to a topological state in which that signal is then prevented from propagating.3. Using topology to significantly enhance nonlinear effects for efficient conversion of RF energy to higher frequencies where it is more efficiently absorbed.4. Nonlinear edge rectification, where RF currents that are naturally concentrated at problematic regions such as edges are efficiently converted to nonradiating DC currents using nonlinear devices. The goal of this program will be to explore each of the concepts, as well as others that may emerge during the course of this research. We will then develop these into practical structuresthrough a combination of electromagnetic and circuit simulations. The most promising ideas will then be built into prototypes that will be fabricated and tested. We will explore a range of designs based on the concepts noted above, and optimize those that show the most promise. After findingsuccessful designs, we will then construct and test prototypes.We expect that at the conclusion of this program we will have developed a new class of activeand/or nonlinear topological surfaces that will significantly exceed the capabilities of existing metasurfaces and other conventional approaches for suppressing high power microwave signals. New advancements may include surfaces supporting only one-way propagation so that systemscan still radiate while being protected from incoming electronic attack, surfaces that automatically transition into a topologically protected state when the incoming power exceeds a particular threshold, or highly nonlinear surfaces or edges that efficiently upconvert signals to frequency ranges where they are more efficiently absorbed. These broadband or frequencyreconfigurable materials can be integrated into edges or around apertures, or they can beembedded into the composite skins of future vehicles to protect against a broad range of emerging threats.less",

        "abstract": "Ambient sounds from long-term passive acoustic recordings show a diel and lunar pattern. Preliminary analysis suggests that backscatter organisms in the water column, possibly from deep-scattering layer (DSL) organisms, either produce sound or modulate the propagation of sound based on diel changes of their depth distribution and density. Ambient sound patterns of biological origin in a frequency range relevant to US naval sonar may alter sonar ranges with predictable patterns. Additionally, organisms in the water column are \u201cbio-clutter\u201d targets that alter sound propagation on these time scales, dependent on the target behavior and density. The goal of the proposed project is to identify if sound is produced or modulated by backscatter organisms and to describe the long-term variability of these sounds based on fixed sensors. In conjunction with this we will use active acoustic data from a variety of sources to document variability of acoustic backscatter on similar temporal scales but also with spatial respect in both depth and along horizontal survey lines. We will investigate the relationship of intensity of acoustic backscatter and ambient sound across time and space. These results will be relevant to the US Navy sonar community. Scatterer, especially krill and DSL organisms, are prey items for large predators, of which marine mammals are of particular interest to the US Navy. Predator-prey relationships are important ecosystem drivers. Prey is likely a good indicator for marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior. Moving models on cetacean dynamics from distant indicators (such as chlorophyll or temperature) to actual prey measures is an intriguing opportunity. Cetacean acoustic detections will be noted on passive acoustic data. We will identify if acoustic backscatter and ambient noise measurements may be suitable for predictive modeling of cetacean presence. The possibility of long-term, autonomous monitoring of prey distribution and behavior using passive acoustic means will lead to an increased predictability of marine mammal presence in an area relevant to the US Navy.less",

Two of these species (a luminous marineworm and a luminous brittlestar) are subject to previous AFOSR studies and will be continuedand terminated here. We are excited to introduce two new systems from luminous coelenterates(sea-anemone-like organism), one being deep-sea and the other parasitic. Their light productionis unique in being multi-modal and with large Stokes shift. As for the three other systems, theyare fluorescent only and consist of nudibranch mucus, and molecules from plant seeds. In eachcase, we will apply conventional techniques routinely done in the Deheyn lab to extract insolution active (chemiluminescent and/or fluorescent) compounds of the light producingsystems, which will then be purified and concentrated by chromatography and gelelectrophoresis.

        "abstract": "The correct geometric and photometric representations of the natural world are crucial for computer vision and image understanding. A long-term goal of computer vision has been to reconstruct the 3D visual world, and develop new methods for image understanding.This in turn enables autonomous agents to perform maritime surveillance, assist in home robotics situations, or create dense 3D models. Physics-based vision relies on particular representations of object geometry such as depth maps, disparity maps or meshes. Indeed, a rich area of multiview stereo and 3D computer vision have been based on these traditional geometric representations, which have also received considerable interest in computer graphics and other fields.However, it has become clear in recent years that thesegeometric representations, while corresponding well to physical objects, have serious limitations. One challenge is in handling occlusions, and mis-calibration errors. Other representations, such as multi-plane images allow for an alpha channel enabling smooth compositing. Nevertheless, many of the challenges of conventional geometric representations remain. Similar challenges hold withinthe area of view synthesis or image-based rendering in computer vision and graphics, where users seek to create immersive representations of scenes from a sparse set of images. This problem is of significant naval importance in visualizing realistic maritime or battlefield scenarios in an immersive environment.We propose a radical departure from decades-old geometric and photometric representations in computer vision, to consider neural volumetric representations. Such representations consider a continuous volume ratherthan a hard surface, avoiding many of the problems inherent in dealing with occlusions and mis-calibrations. Moreover, we can leverage recent advances in machine learning to represent the scattering properties at each location in the volume using a neural representation such as a multi-layer perceptron or MLP, which effectively serves as a trainable procedural function. This builds on our award-winning, widely cited and publicized work on Neural Radiance Fields or NeRFs, which proposes an implicit volumetric representation, where the volume density and color are represented by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a function of spatial location and angular direction. However, the basic NeRF method is very slow both to train and evaluate, does not generalize to new scenes, does not enable relighting, cannot deal with very sparse user input, does not deal with dynamic scenes, and a question remains on the optimal representation.This proposal seeks to address many of these challenges, developing a complete pipeline for physics-based vision using neural volumetric representations. We focus on the optimal representations, extending view synthesis to full light transport acquisition, development of sampling rates with sparse sampling, and analysis of dynamic scenes. This is of particular importance in a naval context where maritime approaches must be able to consider volumetric media such as misty air or the ocean, and reconstruct dynamic volumetric scenes. We are proposing an inherently new representation that also impacts many areas beyond physics-based computer vision, such as reconstruction, segmentation, and scene parsing.The PI is uniquely qualified for this proposal, with many of the foundational results on which this work builds developed with funding from prior ONR grants. The PI was named an IEEE and ACM Fellow and inducted into the SIGGRAPH academy in the last few years. His earlier work has been recognized with the ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award in Computer Graphics, and the ONR PECASE and Young Investigator Awards in physics-based computer vision; the success of these and subsequent ONR grants also shows that he can work with ONR and appreciate basic research with future naval relevance.less",

        "abstract": "Robots capable of exploring the sea-floor environment have many potential applications of relevance to the Navy including structural inspection, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and exploration. However, current aquatic robots are either only capable of swimming through water, or have limited digging capabilities. Many marine animals, by contrast, skillfully transition between swimming and digging to hunt or evade predation. In particular,polychaetes (bristle worms) are an abundant class of annelids capable of a variety of locomotion behaviors well adapted to life at the ocean oor. By propagating transverse or longitundinal waves through their soft bodies, in coordination with motions of small protrusions called parapodia along their bodies, polychaetes can swim eeffectively through water, and dig through sandy or muddy substrates. Inspired by polychaetes, in this proposal we will discover the basic principles required to design, build, and test an aquatic soft robot for sea-floor exploration that has two fundamental locomotion capabilities: 1) swimming locomotion in water, and 2) digging locomotion within the granular substrate of the sea-floor. We call this Swimming & Digging robotSanD-Worm\". SanD-Worm will use combinations of body undulation and parapodia actuation to achieve swimming and digging behaviors. In the proposed work, we will perform experiments to determine optimal actuation parameters, as well as the sensor locations and modalities required for feedback control of the robot.The design and operation of SanD-Worm will build upon insights that PIs Gravish and Tolley have gathered from a preliminary investigation in which they built a digging soft robot for dry granular material. The mechanical design of SanD-Worm will use soft exterior materials such as silicone and other elastomers to achieve a soft, expandable exterior body. Rotational actuation in each segment of the robot will be provided by either soft bending actuators, or brushless DC motors. The operational actuation parameters such as amplitude,frequency, and multi-actuator coordination will be determined experimentally through laboratory tests. A fundamental area of research for success in this project is determining how body movements weaken or strengthen submerged granular material; weakening is required for reducing drag force on the body, and strengthening is required to generate forward thrust. The design and testing of this system leverages the combined expertise of the PIs in the physics of granular flow (Gravish), and the design and control of soft robots (Tolley).The project will be performed in four phases (swimming, digging, swim-to-dig transition, and subsurface navigation) culminating in a robot demonstration of locomotion capabilities in year three.less",

This regime, where particles are composed of tens to tens of thousands of atoms (~1-10 nm), manifests a transition from fully bulk-like properties to fully molecular properties. At this frontier of magnetic and electronic computing materials we find a significant challengeas well as an opportunity to observe new physics and chemistry. It also represents a difficult sizescalefor top-down approaches.Approach:PI sees opportunities for a new generation of bottom-up materials created using standard inorganic chemistry techniques for the following reasons:(1) Precision is key: small compositional variation on the atomic scale can drastically alter materials properties.(2) Properties exploration and optimization should not be limited by expensive, time-intensive synthetic methodologies.(3) Next-generation materials will require multi-functionality. Methods for creating well-definedheterostructures will be important.(4) Next-generation materials will require in-situ tunable properties. Interaction with external stimuli will be important.SOW:YEAR 1(1) Synthesis and magnetic characterization of M6 Clusters. (2) First demonstration of impurity-cluster seeded semiconductor (colloidal solotronic material). (3) Synthesis of nucleation-cutoff (1-3 nm) ultra-small magnetic nanoparticles.(4) Develop quantitative model of interparticlecoupling effects on magnetization in ultra-small particles.(5) Determine magnetochemical series of surface ligands and demonstrate no drop in anisotropy in ultra-small regime.YEAR 2:(1) Demonstration of oxide-based colloidal solotronic materials.(2) First colloidal synthesis of shape-anisotropic AlNiCo nanoparticles.(3) Demonstration of shell-based exchange spring interaction in AlNiCo. (4) Field-oriented sintering to achieve 5x increase in coercive field.YEAR 3:(1) Lower sintering temperature to sub-500 ~C for high-density exchange-spring magnetic materials.(2) Demonstrate order-of-magnitude magnetic field swtiching behavior in photoactivated nanomaterial.YEAR 4:(1) Prove appearance of superparamagnetic behavior on charge-doping paramagnetic oxide materials.(2) Demonstate first proof-of-principle soft-material heterostructured exchange-spring magnetMerit and Relevance:This project is synergistic with ONR's vision of bottom-up assembled carbon-based molecular electronics. PI is a leading expert in molecular magnetics research and exploitation of spin degree of freedom is one of the major opportunities at the molecular scale electronic system.less",

The proposed effort is split into three parts: (1) Experiment planning, (2) hardware preparation, and (3) participation in SCE17. The PI will participate in an experimental planning meeting scheduled for late FY16. It is anticipated that two (2) 32-element vertical receiver arrays will be prepared for deployment during the experimental phase. The arrays will be configured to collect acoustic data continuously for ~12 days prior to needing servicing. The VLAs will be populated with up to 50 self-recording thermistor devices to collect water column temperature data during the experiment. In addition to the array hardware, source transmission hardware will be prepared for SCE17. The source tow system consists of a 2-channel digital waveform synthesis capability, power amplifiers, winch, tow cable, depth sensor and monitor hydrophone, and transducers. MPL has an ITC-2015 mid-frequency transducer (1.5-4 kHz) and we propose renting a J15-1 transducer for low-frequency transmissions (50 Hz ~ 1 kHz).

The monsoon intra-seasonal oscillation [MISO] influences many different weather and climate phenomenon both locally in the Indian Ocean region as well as the remotely via atmospheric teleconnections into the mid-latitudes and other ocean basins. The processes controlling MISO characteristics a\"re still not well understood. Improvements in weather and climate modeling, such as improved physics parameterization, higher model\"\" resolutions, over the past few decades have also improved the simulation and predictions of MISO significantly. Yet, the current we\"ather prediction models are still limited in their prediction skill of the MISO compared to the potential predictability of the MISO\" events. Processes relevant to MISO simulations such as the coupled feedbacks in the northern Indian Ocean, interactions with the Fi\"\"ndlater jet, and the large-scale Indian monsoon circulation are inadequately represented in regional and global coupled models. Thes\"e inaccuracies could be related to the either poor parameterization of model physics or insufficient model resolution to resolve the\" critical processes. New efforts in observations, process understanding and translation into weather and climate models are necessar\"y for improvements in simulation and prediction of the MISO. There is also need for identify-cation of sources of predictability in\" the region for MISO events on the subseasonal timescale. Hence, targeted experiments to help identify these sources will help impro\"ve capabilities to predict MISO events further. We propose to address the key goals of the MISO-BOB DRI relevant to improving the understanding and prediction of the MISO events using a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model and data assimilation tools. We will\" design a regional coupled ocean-atmosphere forecasting tool with data assimilation for improved process understanding, identify sou\"rces of predictability as well as better design of observation networks in the region. We will also collaborated with other scientists in the DRI to optimally use observations as well as global modeling studies for better understanding and prediction of the MISO events.less",

Fleet Science Center, and in coordination with the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) propose a three-year effort to increase the flow of ONR-funded research content and practices into high school classrooms in the San Diego area. Specifically, this proposal aims to leverage the powerhouse of ONR-funded work at both UC San Diego (UCSD), UCSD affiliated organizations (e.g. Scripps Institution of Oceanography) and SPAWAR by directly linking ONR scientists and engineers to high school teachers via a newly created communicating science infrastructure. Lesson study cycles will serve as the primary vehicle through which the infrastructure will be built, with teachers recruited through CREATE\u2019s extensive science teaching network and contacts with local high school districts. During lesson study cycles, researchers will initially share their scientific and engineering design practices and content with small teams of teachers who will then work to adapt their new knowledge of content and practices into high school science lessons. These lessons will be purposively designed with the newly introduced Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in mind, providing teachers with deep content and valuable time together to practice shifting their classroom lesson(s) towards the NGSS. Participating teachers will then work collectively in small teams to refine their lessons via an iterative process\u2014by teaching, observing and re-teaching them to their classrooms of high school students. The lessons and all supportive curricular materials and any created assessments will then be posted and shared online and through existing teacher development networks both regionally and, perhaps, nationally. The Reuben H. Fleet will use its central location in San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park, facilities and extensive knowledge of communicating science to lay audiences to further infuse the process with excitement and accessibility.

There is a pressing need to test thesetechnologies together in a realistic ocean environment to asses their relative merits andoptimize their performance characteristics. In addition, this range will be accessedthrough an internet portal, enabling access by students and postdoctoral scholars remotelyand at low cost, providing a valuable research tool and educational resource to earlycareerinvestigators. The range will contain standard optical and acoustical componentson underwater nodes, enabling users to access the underwater channel without anyrequirements for their own hardware modules. Standard external connectors will also beprovided, enabling the operation of custom hardware provided by users for test andevaluation. Two fixed nodes will be cabled to the SIO Pier providing continuous accessto fixed transmission paths. Two mobile, autonomous nodes will also be constructed,allowing flexible transmission paths for users who require specific transmissiongeometries. The deployment of autonomous nodes will be for limited periods and requirethe use of nearshore craft and personnel.

The effect can amplify the electric signals at a bias level an order of magnitude lower than impact ionization, and promises high gain and extremely low noise. We named the effect Cascaded Exciton Ionization (CEI), hypothesizing that the mechanism originates from strong interactions between carriers, excitons, and phonons. In sharp contrast with most exciton based devices that display their unique characteristics under low temperature, the heat-assisted photocurrent effect (HAPC) becomes more effective at and above room temperature, making it highly attractive to real device applications. The discovery could have tremendous impact on both basic science and applications, and we propose a basic research program with the following objectives: (a) develop a rigorous explanation of the underlying physics of this mechanism; (b) develop methods to realize the mechanism in semiconductors; (c) demonstrate how the effect can impact device performance, especially optical sensing and imaging, of interests to defense and commercial applications.less",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Navy\u2019s goal is to to seamlessly forecast from the deep ocean, across the entire continental shelf to the shoreline. To accomplish this, the relevant surfzone and inner-shelf variability must be accounted for either by inclusion of the appropriate physics or by parameterization. Surfzone breaking waves generate vertical vorticity on the scales of 10-20 m, leading to surfzone eddies and transient rip current ejections on 50\u2013100 m scales. Rip current variability at these length-scales is ubiquitous on the inner-shelf, as seen in both airborne inner-shelf dye and temperature measurements. This results in thermal and material exchange between the surfzone and inner shelf and onto the mid-shelf. Only wave-resolving models (e.g., PI developed funwaveC) represent finite-crest length wave breaking that generates surfzone eddies and transient rip currents, but do not include important shelf physics (stratification or vertically sheared currents). Waveaveraged models (e.g., Delft3D, NearCom, COAWST) include appropriate shelf physics but cannot generate surfzone eddies leading to transient rip currents. First results from direct coupling of wave-resolving and wave-averaged models (funwaveC & COAWST) demonstrate the strong effects and feedbacks that transient rip currents have on inner-shelf stratification. However, direct coupling is highly inefficient and parameterizations must be developed to allow small scale eddy generation to be represented in wave-averaged models. The overall project objectives are to develop and test parameterizations for surfzone eddy generation driven by finite-crest wave breaking (on 10\u201320 m scales) due to a directionally spread wave field. This will allow wave-averaged models that include stratification and vertically sheared currents (such as COAWST or Delft3D) to incorporate transient rip current effects on the inner-shelf. A key element in developing these parameterizations is understanding the space-time statistics (e.g., alongshore wavenumber spectra) of eddies (vorticity) and breaking-wave eddy forcing. PI preliminary results with funwaveC simulations highlight the role of wave directional spread in setting the magnitude and alongshore length-scales of surfzone eddies. To quantify these effects, funwaveC simulations are required over a wide range of wave conditions and bathymetries. PI Feddersen is the funwaveC developer, which has been validated against field observations in a variety of applications including runup, alongshore currents, and surfzone eddy structure. From the wave-resolving funwaveC results, the surfzone eddy forcing mechanism will be parameterized for use in wave-averaged models. Specifically, we will: Develop a SMP parallelized version of funwaveC increasing the model\u2019s computational efficiency and allowing many more simulations to be performed in a particular period of time. Conduct 500 funwaveC simulations across a wide variety of wave conditions and bathymetries. Quantify the space-time structure and statistics of the breaking-wave surfzone eddy generation mechanism from the funwaveC simulations and develop parameterizations for it. This will lead to the development of a COAWST-ROMS subroutine enabling proper surfzone eddy generation. We will subsequently test this wave-averaged model parameterization to ensure that transient rip currents are correctly generated and evolving. Develop tested parameterizations for the the effects of 50\u2013100 m scale rip current variability on larger scales for coastal models with coarser resolution. The project results will be improved models and predictive capability that will enable accurate simulation of ocean conditions across the continental shelf.less",

Our Norwegian partner is the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) in Bergen, led by Hanne Sagen. The CAATEX experiment would take advantage of the EU project MOSAiC, in which an icebreaker, the R/V Polarstern, will drift across the Eastern Arctic in the Transpolar Drift from summer 2019 to summer 2020. Transmissions from an acoustic source deployed from the icebreaker will enable remote sensing of the Arctic basin. The NERSC proposal for the source deployment and two receivers has been funded by the Norwegian Research Council, contingent on funding from an American partner. We anticipate proposing to deploy at least two receivers in the western Arctic. The planning and preparations include the testing of a potential acoustic source and travel to develop the scientific and engineering plans. This proposed experiment is designed to be comparable to previous trans-Arctic propagation experiments conducted in the 1990s. The drift track and multiple receivers of CAATEX will allow for an expansion of the measurements throughout the basin. The comparisons will contrast present day heat content to the past measurements, but there are several other points of comparison. These include transmission loss, which depends in part on the ratio of first-year ice to older ice; acoustic scattering, which diagnoses the strength of internal-wave activity; and the acoustic arrival structure, which changes with the vertical stratification. More capable receiving arrays and a more compact sound source that can be deployed from a ship will be able to extend the analysis beyond previous work. Support for testing the source and for laboratory personnel to upgrade and modernize acoustic receivers is a necessary part of the preparation. The hardware costs have already been provided for through two FY17 DURIPS: (1) \u201cSecond-generation Controllers for Distributed Vertical Line Array (DVLA) Underwater Acoustic Receivers\u201d (N00014-17-1-3010) and (2) \u201cLow-frequency Acoustic Sources for Ocean Acoustic Propagation Experiments\u201d (N000014-17-1-3006).

        "abstract": "Network oscillations of different frequencies, durations and amplitudes are hypothesized to coordinate information processing and transfer across brain areas. Understanding the mechanisms and microcircuits involved in information processing can open up new opportunities towards scalable, efficient and brain-like cognitive skills for computation systems. This enhanced computational capability can assist soldiers for challenging warfare situations. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are the most synchronous population pattern recorded in the mammalian brain. Such synchronous population patterns have beensuggested to be essential for information transfer from the hippocampus to down-stream cortical structures. To date, most of the knowledge about SPW-Rs comes from experimental studies averaging responses from a small number of neurons monitored by conventional microelectrodes with limited number of channels. On the other hand, most of the computational modelling workfor SPW-Rs has focused on small scale networks based on assumptions on connectivity to replicate or validate experimental findings. In this proposed work, we will pursue the opposite approach: utilizing experimental findings to construct a realistic biophysical model. Ourobjectives in this study are (1) to understand emergence and propagation of SPW-Rs in hippocampal microcircuits and to elucidate a complete picture of neuronal participation in SPWRs, and (2) to construct a biophysical model coupling microcircuits of the hippocampus to cortical structures to study information transfer for long term storage.The major challenge facing detailed experimental studies of SPW-Rs is the lack of a technology to monitor large number of neurons and simultaneously record responses generated by microcircuits at multiple spatial scales across the entire hippocampus. In response to that unmet need, we have developed a novel optically transparent graphene array technology. Transparency of graphene allows penetration of light for combining multiphoton imaging and optogenetic stimulation with electrophysiology. The transparent electrode technology will be a key enabler for imaging activities of large number of neurons while recording field potentialsgenerated by microcircuits with high spatio-temporal resolution. For the first time, we will obtain a dynamic map of hippocampus with cellular level spatial resolution, spike level temporal resolution, and field potentials measured at multiple scales across the entirehippocampus. This unique experimental capability will enable us to study how SPW-Rs emerge and propagate across neuronal microcircuits and how information is encoded in neuronal spikes and field potentials. In this proposal, we will pioneer an interdisciplinary approach, taking advantage of this unique neurotechnology to develop microcircuit models for different hippocampal regions based on experimental findings. In our computational model, we aim to implement functionally connected microcircuits coupled to cortical structures to investigate information transfer for learning and memory during SPW-Rs. The biophysical computational model we will develop during the course of this proposal will lead to new discoveries about how neuronal microcircuits function and how information is transferred and processed in the brain.less",

        "abstract": "In many naval applications, a human operator or autonomously-controlled system must have (a) theoretically guaranteed safe oper,ating regions and a safety override controller based on limited information about the system and environment, and (b) the ability to,rent theory and tools for safety verification have two major challenges. First, current methods struggle to be scalable while also b,eing applicable to general nonlinear system dynamics. Second, these safety guarantees are made on assumptions about the system and e,nvironment that may be invalidated during deployment. There is therefore a need to develop scalable approaches for safety analysis t,hat can adapt guarantees quickly based on changing assumptions. This proposal seeks to address these challenges by developing new th,ontrol barrier functions (CBFs). HJ reachability is the more general approach, and directly solves for the maximal safe region w,ithin which a system may operate. This approach is less scalable, though recent work from the PI and her colleagues has made advance,s scaling to higher-dimensional systems (6-12 state dimensions). A CBF generally has a more conservative safe region than HJ reachab,ility, but provides a useful quadratic program online controller that smoothly trades off between the desired performance control an,d the necessary safe control. For systems of specific forms, the CBF can be constructed analytically and can therefore be very scala,ble, but finding a valid CBF is in general challenging for nonlinear dynamic systems. There is active research on learning CBF appro,ximations for general system dynamics, and augmenting approximate CBFs with hand-tuned or learned \"backup\" controllers. Specific, thrusts for this proposal include: 1) Direct construction of CBFs. Recent work by the PI explores the connection between HJ rea,chability theory and CBF theory, and demonstrates how a CBF-like function with the largest possible safe operating region can be con,structed directly using HJ reachability tools. The PI will advance this work to identify the conditions under which one can directly, compute CBFs for general nonlinear dynamical systems. 2) Fast approximations with rigorous convergence to safety guarantees. Th,ere are many recent research efforts on efficiently approximating CBFs using data-driven approaches. Within HJ reachability there ar,e advances on converging to safety guarantees based on approximate initializations and decomposition. We propose that by using fast,CBF approximations as initializations for HJ reachability, scalable safety guarantees can be computed for general nonlinear dynamica,l systems. 3) Adapting safety online. There is active research on adapting control policiesfor CBFs based on information learned, on, safe learning to CBFs using these tools from both methods to update safety analyses efficiently with convergence guarantees. Moreov,er, we will explore how to adapt the safe set under large changes in system representations (e.g. changes in the state space) Co,mpletion of these research tasks will allow the community to perform safety verification for many real-world high-dimensional nonlin,ear systems, and to scalably update these safety analyses online based on learned information about the system and its environment.,This ability to use adaptive safe control will be a major asset to next-generation naval missions that must send autonomous systems,to perform tasks in environments with sparse, uncertain, and changing information that may affect the system's safety and performanc,e.(Approved for Public Release)less",

        "abstract": "The diurnal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) in the low latitude ocean influences intraseasonal variability in the atmosphere. The accurate representation of such atmospheric variability ~e.g. the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) or the Monsoon Intrase\"asonal Oscillation (MISO)~ is a major challenge for coupled ocean-atmosphere models, but critical for effective forecasting and thus\" relevant to Naval operational concerns. Diurnal variability in SST depends both on local surface forcing as well as the character o\"f upper ocean variability, which is often influenced by non-local dynamics. Here I propose to use a unique, globally distributed set\"\" of observations of the surface ocean to investigate diurnal cycling in the surface ocean. This dataset, gathered by the Wirewalker\"\" wave-powered profiling vehicle over the course of a number of ONR Departmental Research Initiatives, NSF experiments, and coastal d\"\"eployments, iscomposed of rapid profiling of temperature, salinity, optical characteristics, turbulentmicrostructure, and velocity\"\", and is particularly well-suited for the investigation of diurnalcycling. These data, once assembled and quality controlled, will\"\" be analyzed with the aim of diagnosing the influence of internal waves (particularly near inertial internal wave shear), submesosca\"\"le lateral variability, and barrier layer-type stratification on the evolution of diurnal sea-surface temperature. The data will be\"\" used to constrain a variety of 1-D mixed layer models, and test the potential of various parameterizations of non-local influence o\"n the diurnal cycle. The aim is to develop an improved representation of SST in difficult to model~but critical to accurately represent~regions of the equatorial Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. Efforts to this end will be augmented by a proposed SIO graduate student. I expect his or her participation in this project will comprise the bulk of their PhD dissertation. The unique nature of the obs\"ervations that have been collected, my technical and research expertise, and the timely natureof this research assures a major impa\"\"ct from the proposed effort. This proposal will improve parameterizations of diurnal cycling in coupled ocean-atmosphere models, a k\"\"nown deficiency, which should lead to significantly more skillful forecasts of intraseasonal oscillations. An improvement in forecas\"\"ts of this variability is directly relevant to Naval operations.less",

Our project will use experimental biophysics, lipidomics, comparative physiology, and cellular engineering to better understand mechanisms underlying decompression sickness in cell membranes. We will focus on the pressure-mediated release of microparticles, membrane vesicles which are proposed agents in decompression pathologies. Microparticles are released from cells under hyperbaric conditions and during decompression, where they act as bioactive agents that initiate physiological responses relevant to DCS. However, the cellular mechanisms of microparticle release and even their fundamental properties are poorly defined. To overcome this, we will work with a team of collaborators to better characterize pressure-induced microparticles in both experimental models and diving mammals and develop cellular models for their release. Our central hypothesis is that changes in membrane composition and structure could mediate physiological responses to decompression stresses.

Autonomous pla tforms offer an approach to this observational challenge by being relatively small and portable, so that their numbers and deploymen t patterns can be scaled to the problem at hand. This proposal aims to address this challenge by establishing a fleet of three Spray 2 underwater gliders equipped with sensors to measure pressure, temperature, salinity, velocity, chlorophyll fluorescence and disso lved oxygen. Underwater gliders are proven platforms with scientific applications including: (1) three-dimensional circulation at fr onts, (2) regional oceanography and boundary currents, (3) processes near abrupt topography, and (4) internal waves at tidal and hig h frequencies. Fundamental contributions by Spray underwater gliders in all of these areas have been demonstrated in ONR-sponsored e xperiments over the past 15 years. The three Spray 2 underwater gliders will be used in the Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Su rface Ocean to Interior (Calypso) program. The scientific objective is to quantify three dimensional flow in two ways: (1) indirectl y using 4-dimensional surveys of an ocean front to infer vertical velocity using the omega equation, and (2) using gliders to track isopycnals to directly measure the flow in the subduction region. Future research uses of the Spray 2 underwater gliders may includ e the Improved Science of Observation, Analysis, and Prediction (iSOAP) project focused on predictability in ocean regions. In this application, underwater gliders are adaptable platforms whose data are valuable for assimilation into and validation of ocean model s. Spray underwater gliders are key parts of research, education, and outreach at graduate, undergraduate and high school levels. Th e Spray 2 underwater glider is being developed through funding by the National Ocean Partnership Program. Objectives of the the Spra y 2 design include improvements in ease of use, range, speed, and ability to carry and swap sensors.

        "abstract": "A key goal of computer vision and scene understanding is to reconstruct the visual world in 3D, and to understand objects and scene\"\" structure, as well as material properties. This is relevant in many applications, such as automated image understanding, maritime o\"\"r aerial surveillance.However, all computer vision methods essentially assume a single monocular image, or perhaps at best binocul\"\"ar observation. This assumption was reasonable in the past, with bulky cameras. However, we are increasingly seeing a revolution whe\"\"re new types of multi-camera imaging sensors are available, along with the computational power to take advantage of them. For exampl\"\"e, current mobile devices such as the iPhone 7+ include two cameras (dual lenses), with images combined using computational photogra\"phy. Mobile camera arrays have been proposed by vendors such as Pelican Imaging. Consumer light field cameras have become available\" from Lytro and Raytrix. These cameras capture the full 4D light field, corresponding not just to 2D pixel intensity, but also captu\"ring the angular distribution of light. This in turn allows for photographic applications such as refocusing after capture and small\" shifts in viewpoint within the aperture of the main lens. Moreover, almost every major camera vendor has released a virtual reality\"\" camera, which in general can be viewed as a light field sensor. For virtual reality, having the full light field is crucial to give\"\" a sense of immersion, since the observer can look in any direction and move about the scene. Indeed, a workshop on light fields for\"\" computer vision (L4CV) is now a regular part of computer vision conferences, and the PI will be giving one of the keynote talks at\"\" CVPR 2017.In this proposal, we go beyond simple photography, focusing on computer vision and scene understanding with light field\"\" imaging systems, and expect the insights to be broadly applicable to future multi-camera/video systems. We have made initial effort\"\"s on this problem for shape from light fields, and a novel theory of differential invariants for physics based vision with non-Lambe\"\"rtian reflectance. However, computer vision and scene understanding with light field imaging involve much greater theoretical and pr\"\"actical challenges, which we address in a comprehensive fashion.Specifically, we develop theoretical foundations, including a form\"\"al characterization of the ambiguity space for light fields, analogous to the bas-relief transformation for Lambertian surfaces. Nex\"\"t, we explore new practical applications, including motion blur as a converse of rendering, light fields for scattering with applica\"\"tions to underwater imaging in naval applications, and potential applications in material recognition and scene segmentation. One ke\"\"y goal is to combine physics-based modeling with modern machine-learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks,to enabl\"\"e enhanced scene understanding.Finally, a core problem with higher-dimensional imaging like light fields is lower resolution, sinc\"e the sensor now needs to capture both spatial and angular variation. We will explore new approaches to light field interpolation fo\"r both images and videos, considering applications in virtual reality and remote sensing/imaging. This proposal has significant pote\"\"ntial for future naval relevance, since new sensors could give new capabilities in the maritime domain. Since multicamera or light f\"\"ield sensing is passive, it can be explored in the wild, as required in the ocean.The PI is uniquely qualified for this proposal,\"\" having developed some of the foundational results on reflectance and lighting in computer vision, including unified multi-cue shape\" from light fields. He was recently awarded an endowed chair and elected an IEEE fellow. His earlier work has been recognized with t\"he ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award in Computer Graphics, and the ONR PECASE and Young Investigator Awards in physics-b\"asedless",

        "abstract": "Computer Vision seeks to reconstruct the 3D visual world, enabling scene understanding and material perception for autonomous agents and robots. Applications include automated image understanding of maritime and aerial surveillance imagery, and semantic search of related visual databases. Most computer vision methods are designed for single images or videos (or perhaps a stereo image), and remarkable successes have been achieved on these topics in recent years. However, we are now rapidly transitioning to a world where sparse multi-view imagery is ubiquitous. For example, current mobile phone cameras (Apples iPhone and Googles Pixel flagship phones) have multiple cameras for photographic applications like portrait mode. Indeed, recentwork by the PI and others has shown that even entire 4D light fields, capturing the full spatial and directional flow of light in a scene can be reconstructed from a sparse set of multi-view images. A second major development is that computer graphics photorealistic rendering algorithmshave become accurate and predictive enough that their results can be used to match real images,and these results can be computed at real-time frame rates on current graphics hardware. However, most physics-based computer vision algorithms continue to make assumptions of Lambertian reflectance with no cast shadows or interreflections, and modern deep learning techniques often ignore the physics of light transport altogether. In this proposal, we seek to enable inverse lighttransport for computer vision with full computer graphics photorealistic rendering.This proposal develops a comprehensive approach to the above problems, ranging from theoretical foundations (such as limits for acquisition of light fields from sparse multi-view images, and effects of occlusion, specularity etc.) to algorithms that take in sparse multi-view imagery and recover shape and appearance, including non-Lam ertian effects. We will also consider theimpact on higher-level vision tasks such as segmentation and scene understanding, as well as duals to sparse multi-light imagery. We will explore differentiable rendering and optimization as a general paradigm to solve computer vision problems by refining the physics-based or learning solutionin an optimization pass, and consider theoretical formulations of shape optimization as an Euler-Lagrange variational problem. From a technical point of view, the proposal will combine existing expertise in physics-based computer vision, with physically-motivated deep learning and first order differentiable rendering/vision algorithms. While this proposal represents basic research, there is significant potential for future naval relevance. Maritime surveillance operations involve combining images and reconstructing 3D scenesfrom sparse multi-view imagery. These reconstructions could also be used by autonomous agents and robotic devices. The use of photorealistic scene simulations and first order methods will refine the solutions, enabling accurate shape and material maps which can guide artificial agents, and enable them to fully reason about their environment. Moreover, we have the ability to considerscattering and radiative transfer, as required for underwater imaging. The PI is uniquely qualified for this proposal, having developed some of the foundational results on reflectance and lighting in computer vision, including differential invariants for 3D reconstructions, and unified multi-cue shape from light fields. He was recently named an IEEE, ACM Fellow and inducted into the SIGGRAPH Academy. Approved for Public Release.less",

Multi-photon microscope will be integrated with our 256 channel electrical recording system, providing us with the ability to monitor a diverse range of brain oscillations across large areas in in vivo experiments along with high-resolution calcium imaging of neural activity. Our current ONR grant on developing computational models of hippocampus microcircuits based on experimental findings has led to exciting results. Ourtransparent graphene electrode technology have received a lot of interest because it enables seamless and crosstalk free integration of optical imaging and optogenetic stimulation with electrical recording of neural activity to probe brain circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution. We demonstrated that transparent graphene electrode technology can be used to exactly pinpointthe source of neural oscillations with cellular resolution and quantify the participation of neurons to population activity. This technology can be customized to investigate various problems related to diverse set of computations performed by the brain. New findings on mechanisms of biological intelligence may find applications in next generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems, possibly advancing current AI algorithms towards human-like cognitive skills.In our ONR project we employ this unique technology to investigate hippocampal sharp waveripples. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are the most synchronous population pattern recorded in the mammalian brain, essential for information transfer from the hippocampus to the down-stream cortical structures during learning and memory consolidation. To date, most of the knowledge about SPW-Rs comes from experimental studies averagingresponses from a small number of neurons monitored by conventional microelectrodes with limited number of channels. Transparent graphene electrode technology developed by our lab enables investigation of SPW-Rs by performing multi-modal experiments combining electrophysiology and multi-photon microscopy. SPW-Rs can be recorded from hippocampus while we image whole cortex and study activation of different regions in multiple spatial scales to investigate information transfer from hippocampus to cortex during SPW-Rs.To-date, collaborations with other groups have allowed us to perform several multimodal experiments in transgenic mice models towards the goals of our ONR project. However, lack of a multi-photon microscope in our own lab significantly limits the number of experiments we can perform each month. In addition, technical challenges related to assembling our electrical recording platform to different microscopy setups every time makes repeatable progressextremely difficult. The requested funds in this DURIP proposal will provide the complete system necessary to systematically and continuously investigate the neural mechanisms proposed in the ONR grant in well-controlled experimental settings.less",

Over the past few years, the previous dominant inner-shelf paradigm of (i)weak cross-shore Ekman transport and (ii) cross-shore exchange of onshore wave-driven Stokesdrift and Eulerian return flow (Lentz and Fewings, 2012) has been demolished. Our work hasclearly shown that surfzone-generated rip currents (primarily transient rip currents, TRCs) and onshorepropagating nonlinear internal waves (NLIW) are the dominant exchange mechanisms in thenear-inner-shelf or the 200-500 m wide region just offshore of the surfzone, and they evolve onvery short time-scales (minutes to hours). Many unanswered questions remain: How much verticalmixing (turbulence) do these processes induce in the near-inner-shelf? How do TRC and NLIW interact?High spatial and temporal resolution observations of TRC and NLIW events are scarce, andtheir interaction non-existent Although models have inferred strong TRC-induced vertical mixing3 surfzone widths offshore, TRC or NLIW mixing observations do not exist.In order to obtain high-resolution observations of TRC and NLIW events in the near-innershelf,we propose to build an Mobile Rip Current and Nonlinear Internal Wave Profiler Systemthat will dramatically expand our field capability to agilely sample TRC and NLIW events in thenear-inner-shelf in water depths < 6 m where small boats cannot operate. Observations from thissystem will provide the basis for addressing the science questions above. The proposed elementsof the Mobile Rip Current and Nonlinear Internal Wave Profiler System include:Jetski-based mobile current, CTD, turbidity, and microstructure profiler: The jetski will beequipped with an Xylem ADCP, Biosonics Echosounder, a a winched boom with CTD andmicrostructure profiler, RTK GPS and a Toughpad tablet for real time data display. Thismobile instrument platform will allow for in situ rip current and NLIW sampling.Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) with Thermal Infrared Imagery: A FLIR Zenmuse XT2LWIR camera will be mounted on a DJI Matrice 210 RTK V2 UAV with RTK GPS inorder to make real-time measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) in regions where ripcurrents and NLIW interact. The system will cover a 500 m by 500 m at pixel resolutionat 1 m with temperature accuracy of 0.1oC. Real-time data will allow our FAA certifiedoperator to guide the mobile jetski to sample regions of interest.Wirewalker Mooring with Realtime Telemetry: A Del Mar Ocean Wirewalker mooring in15-20 m depth will have a CTD with real time telemetry via cell phone network allowingnotification of NLIW events.The PI, students and post-doctoral researchers will utilize the requested instrumentation in thesisresearch, publications, and presen\"tations.

However, limited in-situ observations of this rapid evolution make it unclear how to adequately parametrize these physical propert ies of the upper ocean based on the environmental variables. In this proposal, we will develop a novel acoustic instrumentation pack age, the Towed Acoustic Modules for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (TAM-ASV), specifically designed for deployment on uncrewed surface vehicles, and capable of characterizing the modulation of sound speed and ambient soundscape caused by surface and upper-ocean proce sses.

        "abstract": "Ocean fronts and related submesoscale processes at the air-sea interface are of growing Naval interest in oceanography and marine atmospheric science. They are regions where the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers depart from the usual boundary-layer assumptions that vertical gradients in the relevant variables (e.g., currents, wind speed, temperature, gas concentration, biogeochemical variables) may be much larger than the horizontal gradients, and so can involve much horizontal and vertical mixing and upwelling and downwelling. They are also regions where wave-current interaction can lead to significant wave breaking with concomitant increases in bubble-mediated gas transfer, ambient noise and momentum flux from waves to currents that could significantly impact acoustic and electromagnetic propagation. Thus, to measure these processes in the Surface Ocean and Lower Atmosphere (SOLA) requires combined in situ measurements on both sides of the air-sea interface at scales where regular research vessels interfere with the flows and measurements. Last year, to address this problem, Melville and Lenain were funded (ONR FY19 DURIP) to develop a faster autonomous platform, the Rapid Autonomous Surface Vehicle System for Submesoscale Air-Sea Interaction Research (RASVS). It is a fast (up to 10kts), shorter endurance (7-10 days) unmanned system vehicle instrumented for air-sea interaction research capable of both surface and subsurface measurements, and atmospheric sampling, using a meteorological bow mast and a tethered multicopter instrument. It is based on the L3/ASV Global C-Worker 5 autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). We are proposing to improve the present RASVS capabilities, enhancing both its autonomy, through hardware and software upgrades to provide improved situational awareness and automated collision avoidance ability, along with additional ocean and atmospheric sensing capabilities, to better resolve the marine atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers.less",

This cluster will support the research of PI Ramamoorthi, funded by ONR # N000141712687 on Computer Vision and Scene Understanding with Light Field Imaging. The project addresses key goals of computer vision and scene understanding to reconstruct and understand the visual world in 3D. This is relevant in many pivotal applications in national defense such as navigation, localization, and mapping for unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, and maritime surveillance for battlefield intelligence. We are increasingly seeing a revolution where new types of multi-camera imaging sensors are available, along with the computational power to take advantage of them. For example, currentmobile devices such as the iPhone 7+ include two cameras (dual lenses), with images combined using computational photography. Mobile camera arrays have been proposed by vendors such as Pelican Imaging. Consumer light field cameras have become available from Lytro and Raytrix. These cameras capture the full 4D light field, c orresponding n ot j ust t o 2D p ixel i ntensity, but also capturing the angular distribution of light. Moreover, almost every major camera vendor has released a virtual reality camera, which in general can be viewed as a 4D light field sensor. The PI~s ONR-funded research leverages his groundbreaking results on physics-based computer vision (recently honored by elevation to IEEE and ACM Fellow, and earlier by an ONR Young Investigator and PECASE awards), with advances in deep learning, which have recently revolutionized image understanding tasks. However, light fields are 4D quantities, involving substantial datasets. As such, significant computational hardware is needed for machine learning on large 4D light field datasets. Moreover, we are increasingly exploring the use of synthetic datasetscoupled with real images to train neural networks. The computer clusters requested will greatly assist in fast rendering of thousands of synthetic images.Along with 4D light field d ata, we are s eeing an explosion in 3D geometric models ( in fact light field cameras are a prime passive acquisition device for 3D geometric data). In collaboration with co-PI Su, we will investigate large-scale 3D machine learning. The hardware proposed here will be pivotal to planned ONR MURI proposal (Active Perception and Knowledge Exploitation in Navigation and Spatial Awareness) and ARO proposal (Foundations of Image and MultimodalData Analysis). We will build and deploy 20 GPU-based servers, each containing 8 GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti). Each server is expected to cost around $18.3K. We will further include 10 CPU servers for applications in which we need to generate large synthetic datasets or require significant CPU cycles for other purposes. We also include 4 storage servers for serving data and archivingpurposes. The plan leads to a total equipment cost of approximately ?$495K. This equipment will be actively used by some 20 Ph.D. students within the UC San Diego Center for Visual Computing, and will also enable collaborations on federally funded research with other computer vision faculty like Profs. Chandraker and Tu. Finally, the computer cluster will enable tight integrationof research and education for Ph.D. students, as well as MS and undergraduate students taking our advanced graphics, vision, and machine learning courses.less",

However, scenario development is highly complex and involves a great deal of human effort and domain knowledge, discouraging the modification of existing scenarios to keep them current in an ever-changing threat environment. This problem is exacerbated when the scenario represents a combination of multiple data sources. The proposed Phase II effort will leverage the positive results from the Phase I research to develop a fieldable Scenario Generator able to output Stallion-ready training scenarios. The Scenario Generator will make use of data-driven static models developed during Phase I, which significantly reduced scenario creation time and reduced the domain knowledge required. The Phase I research showed that domain knowledge, encapsulated within selected data source, could be used to drive static models, and that those static models could be orchestrated such that their output produces a cohesive, multiple-Intelligence (Multi-INT) scenario.less",

        "abstract": "The Automatic Radio Frequency (RF) Measurement Module (ARMM) supports Specific Emitter Identification/Specific Emitter Verification (SEI/SEV) by providing detailed measurements against collected communication signals. ARMM is an integrated set of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms that extracts and reports key features against collected signals. A feature analysis capability can then determine if the measurements match the characteristics of a known emitter of interest. ARMM addresses a critical need of the Navy cryptologic community by automating measurement processes that have been traditionally handled by manual or semi-automatic means. This need becomes more critical as the number of communication devices escalates and the complexity of these devices increases. ARMM addresses current and emerging communications technologies as an open, portable, and scalable software system. BENEFITS: The resultant ARMM technology can be incorporated into existing Tactical Cryptologic Systems, providing immediate improvement to the reporting capabilities of these systems. Transmissions of tactical relevance will be reported more accurately, while those transmissions with similar characteristics, but not of interest, will be filtered out. The manning requirements for afloat cryptologic technicians may be reduced due to the elimination of complex, time-consuming manual analyses. It is believed that the ARMM technology can be applied to the commercial market in a wide range of applications, including law enforcement and telecommunications systems. Law enforcement agencies may employ the ARMM technology to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of potentially threatening mobile communication systems. Criminal and terror organizations increasingly rely on commercial equipment for their communication needs. The ARMM technology may be used to distinguish the communication equipment known to be used by these organizations from those used for lawful means. Telecommunication systems may employ the ARMM technology for \"emitter verification\" to ensure only valid terminals access its communication networks. Cellular networks, for example, may be susceptible to piracy and/or spoofing by rogue transmitters accessing the network. The ARMM technology may be used to reject those terminals not exhibiting specific characteristics, preventing fraudulent use of their communication networks.less",

We propose to address these goals with a focused array of novel 5-beam ADCPs deployed in an intensive observational period on the inner shelf (Fig. 1). Below we describe the instrument and expected observations in more detail before moving onto the proposed analysis and budget. In the following subsections, we demonstrate the types of phenomena that we expect to observe from a recent test deployment in 16 meters of water near the Scripps Pier (Fig. 4). The data has just come in at the time of this writing, and analysis is at a very preliminary stage. However, many of the unique advantages of the new instrument shine through clearly.less",

Much of the theoretical work to date based on the concepts of ???Lagrangian coherent structures??? (LCS) has focused on the horizontal flow distributions and trajectories. CALYPSO intends to help extend these to 3D and vertical motion. Initial theoretical attempts for this were made by Bettencourt et al. (2012), Sulman et al. (2013), Allshouse and Peacock (2015) and others. A novel approach is that of Feppon & Lermusiaux (2018) who compute so-called ???flow maps??? which can be used to calculate fully 3D FTLE fields very efficiently. Many of the related observational techniques based on LCSs and FTLE analysis require a numerical field based on altimetry, model hindcasts, or data assimilation. The MSEAS team of Lermusiaux et al. have developed tools for data assimilation which can produce these model fields for analysis by other CALYPSO partners.CALYPSO will study the front which usually forms in the eastern Alboran Sea, resulting from the convergence of the Algerian Current deflected into the East Alboran Gyre (EAG) and the Northern Current which flows south along the French and Spanish coast. Our objective is to observe these two inflow branches during the two targeted observing periods in 2019 and 2020. For this we will test a new design of light-weight real-time low-cost moorings for short duration deployments in year 1, and in years 2 and 3 operate three geostrophic end-point moorings during the targeted observing periods to capture the inflow and upstream boundary condition. We will provide data, in delayed-mode and in real-time, to CALYPSO modelers for hindcasts, nowcasts, and forecasts of the frontal region, and collaborate with partners to understand what constraints the inflow conditions can provide for 3D LCSs in this front. We will place the moorings based on previous-day altimeter maps, on real-time analyses of the flow field (from SOCIB and from the MIT MSEAS system), and based on planning for the frontal field work in the subsequent days. The moorings would remain deployed for the approximately two weeks of the intensive frontal surveys. In order to make the mooring low-cost, light-weight, and real-time, we would merge our standard subsurface mooring type having inductive T/S sensors clamped onto the wire with the new mini-moorings under development for a small surface expression, and re-use older wire. This concept will be tested off Mallorca in collaboration with the SOCIB partners in year 1. Years 4 and 5 will have a low level of analysis work, with more science applications planned through an externally funded graduate studentless",

Such fuzzy structures are constituted from high-void, nanometer scale morphologies and induced through interaction of very light element (such as hydrogen and helium) plasmas, with a variety of metals and ceramics. Pressures in the range of GPa has been indicated inside and near the gas nano-bubbles incorporated into the materials, with enhanced trapping at material interfaces promoting the pinning of dislocations and increasing hardness The unique stress state could also be utilized for inter-mixing at temperatures less than that suggested by equilibrium phase diagrams, and promote enhanced diffusion as well as metastable phase formation, yielding unparalleled structural and physical attributes. To probe the utility and efficacy of the metallic fuzzy nanostructure fillers in structural materials, it is proposed to synthesize, and subsequently characterize, two kinds of composites, incorporating metals, ceramics, or polymers as the matrix/second phase (I) using a novel supercritical fluid-based technique, and (II) through blending with a polymer matrix. The deployment of two strategies for the synthesis, provides adequate risk mitigation. While the Type I composite is being attempted for the first time, as part of the proposed work, the Type II composite is more conventional, and the PI has over a decade of experience in the synthesis of such composites. Our preliminary investigations on assessing the integration of nanostructures into suitable background matrices and determination of their structural and mechanical attributes, with respect to the fragile-hard synergy, provides a firm basis. We will analyze the critical concentration and optimal morphologies of fuzzy nanostructures for structural percolation and matrix reinforcement.

The motivation for this work comes from the need for reliable and robust underwater acoustic communications systems networks in the VHF UWCOMMS band, defined here as100 kHz 1 MHz. VHF UWCOMMS have important Navy applications. Wide bandwidths are available, which can be exploited to achieve a combination of high data rates and low SNR performance. The high rate of absorption of VHF-band energy in seawaternaturally limits the range of detectability by hostile assets. Short acoustic wavelengths enable the construction of compact arrays, which facilitates deployment on a wide range of platforms. Notwithstanding its potential advantages, VHF UWCOMMS is not yet a mature technology, and basic research into performance-limiting channel effects and VHF ambient noise are ongoing. The proposed work focuses on 3 aspects of VHF UCSOMMS: I. laboratory and field experiments to study the impact of microbubbles entrained near the sea surface by breaking waves and ship wakes on coherent acoustic communications, II. the development of infrastructure to support laboratory and field studies of high frequency acoustics in shallow water, and III. characterizing and modeling the broad-band underwater soundscape in costal Arctic regions, including the VHF band.This abstract is publicly releasable.less",

They are regions where the oceanic andatmospheric boundary layers depart from the usual boundary-layer assumptions that vertical gradients in the relevant variables (e.g., currents, wind speed, temperature, gas concentration, biogeochemical variables) are much larger than the horizontal gradients, and so can involve much horizontal and vertical mixing and upwelling and downwelling. They are also regions where wavecurrent interaction can lead to significant wave breaking with concomitant increases in bubblemediated gas transfer and momentum flux from waves to currents. Thus, to measure theseprocesses in the Surface Ocean and Lower Atmosphere (SOLA) requires combined in situ measurements on both sides of the air-sea interface. In this proposal, we request the purchase of aSOLA-Instrumented SV3 Model Autonomous Wave Glider and a Reigl RiCopter, an autonomous airborne platform, instrumented with a scanning lidar, infrared imager, and stereo imager. When deployed in coordinated tracks, together, these platforms will significantly increase our ability to measure the generation and evolution of ocean fronts and other submesoscale processes.less",

SIO purchased three TWR sweptfrequencysources (225~325 Hz) for use in the 2004~2005 NPAL (North Pacific AcousticLaboratory) experiment. Two 200~300 Hz sources and an ultralow frequency (140~205 Hz)source were subsequently purchased for use in the 2010~2011 NPAL Philippine Sea experiment.The oldest sources owned by SIO are\" well over a decade old, and even the youngest is over sixyears old.

        "abstract": "The central objective of this project is to develop a new rigorous and unified mathematical framework for super-resolution imaging that can outperform existing techniques by judicious exploitation of prior information on the desired image. Super-resolution refers to the ability to extract finer details (typically high frequency components) of a desired signal from low-resolution easurements. This is a central imaging problem with applications in single molecule microscopy, radar and sonar target localization, and neural signal processing. This problem is highly ill-posed and the underlying signal cannot be recovered unless suitable priors on the desired signal are available. This proposal will address a large class of super-resolution problems across Different modalities (such as microscopy and radar source localization), by showing the unifying role played by correlation priors in pushing the existing resolution limits of super-resolution imaging. New mathematical insights into such correlation-aware algorithms will be developed to further enhance their performance. By identifying the common structural constraints that these algorithms need to satisfy, the proposal also puts forward a unified analysis framework to analyze the performance of these algorithms. Explicit error metrics will be developed which will serve as universal upper bounds on the performance of any super-resolution algorithm utilizing correlation priors. These results will shed new light into super-resolution imaging techniques with enhanced resolution limits, and can potentially become an integral part of the sensing and imaging technology for the operation of U.S. Navy mission-critical systems.less",

These observations have the advantage of being collected in a frame of reference minimally in uenced by advection, and thus will provide a unique opportunity to improve mixed layer parameterizations in the NAS. The coupled ocean/atmosphere interactions that control monsoon intensity and monsoonal Intra-Seasonal Oscillations are of operational relevance to the Navy. Finally, the development outlined in this proposal represents a major step towards a highly capable yet inexpensive and widely utilized upper-ocean observing platform.less",

        "abstract": "n steady, homogeneous, stratified oceans, the production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) comesfrom shear phenomena, both at the surface of the ocean (for example, the Stokes shear, giving rise to Langmuir circulations) as well as in the interior (for example, internal waves with strong shear undergoing Kelvin-Helmholtz instability). This production is mainly balanced by the dissipation rate of the TKE through molecular viscosity while a small portion is used to mix the fluid through the buoyancy flux. Measurements of the dissipation rate of the turbulence is therefore important to estimate the rate of mixing of the ocean. This type of measurements is also of great interest to national security, in particular in research areas related to subsurface hydrodynamics. Measurements of ocean turbulence and the dissipation rate of the TKE have been conducted forthe past 50 years, primarily using shear probes, whose output is directly proportional to the gradient of velocity. However, these probes are very sensitive to vibrations and their measurements cannot be directly corrected for the noise induced by the vibrations of the measurement platform. For the last decade or so, the development of unmanned underwater vehicles has opened the door to collecting measurements of the dissipation rate in very remote locations or denied areas, but remains limited to low-vibration vehicles. In this proposal, we will develop a novel oceanic microstructure profiler instrument package specifically designed for deployment on unmanned surface vehicles, capable of handling a significant level of platform vibration and account for thesemotions in the microstructure measurements. Our approach here is to combine traditional (fast response temperature and conductivity) probes with novel acoustic doppler velocimetry (ADV profilers) techniques to obtain dissipation rate measurements from such vehicles.less",

Many of these advantages derive from its quantum-mechanical nature endowed by long quantum coherence times, controllable entanglement, and high fidelity of operations, which enable opportunities for outperforming its classical counterparts. Taking advantage of those strengths, the PI proposes to introduce NV single spin based quantum sensing and imaging techniques to explore the local spin transport and dynamic behavior of antiferromagnetically coupled materials which harbor a range of exotic, unintuitive, and highly interesting spin-related properties. Examples include topologically protected magnetic textures, energy-dissipationless spin-superfluidity, fractional spin excitations, giant magnetoresistance and many more. We will investigate emergent antiferromagnetic spin behaviors from a unique quantum viewpoint and shed light on their underlying mechanisms at nanoscale. An important goal of this proposed work will be to ascertain the advantage of NV-based quantum coherent magnetic sensing techniques when applied to antiferromagnetic insulators, which are challenging to access by conventional magnetometry methods. The proposed work addresses timely the current challenges facing antiferromagnetic spintronic research and will enable new opportunities in designing next-generation advanced magnetic materials for transformative information technologies.less",

A variety of exotic quantum behaviors, such as correlated insulator-to-superconductor transitions, topologically protected Majorana fermions and coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism, have been observed in a range of superconducting quantum materials, which promise to bring new functionalities to next-generation electronic devices. Despite these remarkable progresses, to date, effective sensing of the local properties of unconventional superconductors with nanoscale spatial resolution remains to be challenging, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism of the emergent superconducting behaviors. Known as a single-spin quantum bit, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, an optically-active atomic defect in diamond, is naturally relevant in this context due to its single-spin sensitivity, nanoscale spatial resolution, and notable versatility in a wide temperature range. Many of these advantages derive from its quantum-mechanical nature, which enables opportunities for outperforming its classical counterparts. Building on these strengths, we propose to introduce an NV center-based quantum sensing platform to explore the local electric- and magnetic field patterns arising from layered, unconventional superconductors in two-dimensional regime, which are challenging to access by the conventional spectroscopic techniques.less",

These networks must scale while keeping cost and energy consumption low. To better support such applications, several recent efforts have begun to examine the suitability of building hybrid networks, which include both electrical packet switches (EPS) and reconfigurable optical circuit switches (OCS). To meet cost, scalability in size, and energy efficiency, we envision new hybrid designs in which photonic components reside on a chip. We have proposed a novel approach to explore arrays of fast tunable laser sources integrated with silicon on insulator (SOI) wave-division multiplexing (WDM) OCS network which also implements High-Speed Adaptive Receivers (HSAR) for wavelength trimming. The proposed approach will use the spectral modes supported by tunable nanolasers, where each processor can be assigned to transmit on a specific spectral mode excited from a drop port. Likewise, its receiver will be supplied by a spectral mode drop port designed to realize the HSAR. For tuning we have explored mechanisms, such as the capacitive free-carrier plasma dispersion effect and tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG) in silicon nitride (SiN), which are capable of providing sub-nanosecond response time to support data flows with sub-microsecond resolution. The goal of this project is to focus on fundamental research to develop novel optical technologies for WDM-based OCS networks by exploiting spectral degrees of freedom enabled by fast tunable arrays of lasers and HSARs. The specific objectives include: (i) design, fabrication and testing of fast tunable and intensity modulated laser sources and their arrays; (ii) design, fabrication and testing of fast tunable HSARs and their arrays; (iii) development of a novel characterization tool to measure the developed tunable lasers and HSAR operating in data modulated regime by exploiting the second-order intensity correlation technique; and (iv) design, manufacturing (via AIM Photonics) and testing of the scaled-down system.less",

Humans often hold multiple short-term goals simultaneously, therefore working memory must persist for future tasks while also meeting immediate needs in the environment. As a result, thoughts and goals that are transiently activated in working memory can interact with ongoing perception, attention, and action\u2014sometimes in unexpected ways. Information from the environment can confuse or overwrite working memory, and information held in working memory can unintentionally drive attention or movements in the environment. This research project examines the cognitive and neural processes that promote or prevent these working memory effects, so that humans can reach optimal performance. This project tests the idea that competing demands in the environment can transform the way that the brain achieves working memory; but humans may have voluntary control over that transformation. This work uses mathematical models to characterize behavioral performance, combined with causal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and advanced functional MRI (fMRI), in healthy human adults. The work will evaluate the information conveyed in neural signals, as well as the configuration of brain networks for communicating those signals, and will then use that data to guide brain stimulation. The project also employs a new TMS-neurofeedback procedure to adaptively modulate working memory goal information for the current circumstances. This approach will provide multi-modal data to predict how humans react to a range of cognitive challenges, and should guide strategies to improve goal maintenance in unpredictable scenarios.less",

PIX will uniquely combine the structural order and coherence of molecular crystals, the flexibility and responsiveness of synthetic polymers, and the chemical/structural versatility of proteins. In doing so, these new materials will provide a new platform for fundamental studies of self-assembly at the interface of polymer chemistry, materials science and structural biology, and enable new modalities in adaptive/self-healing materials, sensing/detection applications and catalysis. The simultaneous presence of structural order and flexibility/adaptiveness/dynamism is a key design principle for the construction of advanced materials. There are many biological (e.g., microtubules, flagella, viruses) and synthetic assemblies (e.g., dynamic molecular crystals and frameworks) that can undergo considerable structural transformations without losing their crystalline order, leading to remarkable mechanical properties with utility in diverse applications ranging from selective sorption and separation to sensing and mechanoactuation. Ultimately, however, the extent of structural changes by such flexible crystalline materials and their elasticity are constrained by the necessity to maintain a continuous network of bonding interactions between the constituents of the lattice. In order to overcome this limitation, we recently introduced the concept of PIX whereby the mesoporous crystals of the protein ferritin were merged with synthetic, poly-acrylate polymers. Proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated that the ferritin crystals-polymer hybrids displayed unprecedent emergent properties such as reversible expansion/contraction and self-healing without losing crystallinity. In the process, they overcame a fundamental limitation of condensed matter: that ordered materials are inflexible and brittle, and flexible/adaptive materials lack substantial order. Using these paradigm-shifting findings as a springboard, our goal in the proposed project is to establish general design principles for PIX, and to create new PIX with tailorable structural and mechanical properties. This will be accomplished through two Thrusts, which will uniquely combine protein biochemistry and organic synthesis with advanced strategies for protein structure/materials characterization and controlled polymer growth. Thrust 1: Establish the compositional scope of ferritin-PIX and elucidate how molecular-level interactions control macroscopic-level properties. Through a systematic study of a library of ferritin variants and synthetic polymers, we will establish general design/construction principles for PIX. Thrust 2: Broaden the compositional, structural and functional scope of PIX. We will use strategies for the controlled growth of polymers and crystal lattices of various proteins a) construct PIX with tailorable materials properties and b) to examine the scope and generalizability of PIX. With its expansive scope that encompasses \u00d2polymer synthesis, supramolecular assembly, and macromolecular hierarchy\u00d3, \u00d2design and synthesis of self-assembled systems with responsive behaviors\u00d3 and \u00d2integration of biological systems with synthetic systems\u00d3, the proposed program builds a bridge between several ARO programs including Polymer Chemistry, Reactive Chemical Systems and Biochemistry/Biomolecular Assembly and Organization.less",

        "abstract": "There are many types of conventional polymers and engineering plastics that display exceptional robustness against mechanical insults, such as scratching, indentation, and delamination. Chief among these materials include the polymers used in car paint, road surfaces, optical coatings, and biomedical implants. In the field of ?-conjugated (semiconducting) polymers\u2014in which devices are expected to find use in mechanically demanding applications in aerospace, nautical, and wearable contexts\u2014the emphasis in the last several year has been to increase the softness. That is, the stretchability, elasticity, and toughness. However, ease of deformability is not the right property for many distributed systems at risk of mechanical damage. Examples of these distributed applications include ultra-lightweight solar panels for UAVs and spacecraft, biomedical sensors integrated with flight suits, and instrumented aircraft surfaces. These applications instead require hardness, strength, and resilience. The goal of this proposal is thus to increase the robustness of materials and devices used in organic electronic and bioelectronic devices against mechanical damage. Our approach encompasses theory informed by computation, chemical synthesis, and processing. In this proposal, each of three research thrusts seeks to understand the design criteria for semiconducting polymers that have mechanical properties characteristic of protective polymeric coatings. We will begin by reconceptualizing the fundamental parameters which govern molecular flexibility for semiconducting polymers (Thrust 1). In particular, we will incorporate the effects of electron delocalization and out-of-plane dihedral torsion on the flexibility of polymer chains. We will then use molecular dynamics simulations to understand deformation of ordered domains in solid films, and use reactive force fields that allow for scission of bonds under mechanical loading. This basic, hypothesis-driven research will be supported by molecular design and synthesis (Thrust 2) that should increase the hardness of the solid films of conjugated polymers without sacrificing the charge-transport properties. The molecular designs proposed in this thrust are based on (i) our computational results, (ii) motifs found in polymers designed for hardness (i.e., engineering plastics), and (iii) knowledge we have produced while engineering conjugated polymers for increased softness. In Thrust 3, we will use a variety of approaches for mechanical characterization to validate the hypotheses posed in Thrusts 1 and 2. Complementing these approaches\u2014many of which were developed in our laboratory\u2014is a new method of processing called solid-phase deposition (SPD). This process takes advantage of deformation and post-deposition hardening to form optoelectronic coatings on a variety of surfaces, including textured, multilayer, and composite structures.less",

        "abstract": "Based on recently demonstrated line waves, and newly developed acoustic topological insulators, we will investigate materials that have complementary polarization properties for sound waves or phonons, and combine them into structures that can support one-way propagation. We will extend this concept to three dimensional structures that can be fabricated as simple layered materials or composites. After studying acoustic frequencies, we will explore phononic topological insulators for one-way thermal transport, and develop structures that can be fabricated from natural or nano-manufactured materials. Although heat can flow in both directions as dictated by the laws of thermodynamics, phonons in such a structure may propagate without scattering, leading to enhanced thermal conductivity. We will explore performance limits, and analyze possible future applications. Scientific Objectives The goal will be to discover or design new composite materials that support one-way propagation of mechanical vibrations, sound (acoustic waves), or heat (phonon waves). The most important output will be an understanding of what combinations of materials are required for acoustic/phononic topological insulators, specific designs, simulations, and measurements of their performance. Methods to be Employed We will begin by analyzing the band structure of mechanical systems based on simple mass/spring models, and proceed to simulations using commercially available software. We will fabricate prototypes using complementary acoustic structures. Initial structures will be 2D composites that can be built commercially, such as lithographically patterned free-standing metal structures, followed by 3D layered materials. Measurements will be performed using actuators and microphones, and nonlinearities will be studied by spectral analysis. We will extrapolate the work to the phononic regime based on either composites created from natural materials, or artificial structures built using nanolithography, and measure them with pulsed heat sources. Significance of the Proposed Effort This work will advance scientific understanding of acoustic and phonon propagation in the emerging area of phononic topological insulators, based on designs that are analogous to electromagnetic line waves. It may enable future applications in sound damping, shock absorption, and improved heat sink materials. Enhanced nonlinearity may also be useful for improved sound absorption.less",

This is because density compensating T and S anomalies are reenforcing in sound speed. The unique spatial and temporal structure of upper ocean spice patterns are set by a balance between three-dimensional subduction, especially near ocean fronts, lateral stirring, and turbulent mixing. Several ONR funded experiments over the last decade have involved exploration of the detailed subduction, stirring and mixing processes in particular parts of the world, ranging from the North Atlantic to the Arctic to the Bay of Bengal to the West Pacific.

        "abstract": "The management of the airspace around a ship and the management of traffic of aircraft on board of an aircraft carrier are very similar control problems. They combine two often mutually opposed objectives: rapid arrival at a destination/target and avoidance of collision with other friendly vehicles. Such highly constrained nonlinear optimization problems defy solution in real time, especiallyunder considerable uncertainty coming from the environment and other factors arising in combat. Several recent developments in control algorithm design, pioneered by the PI, offer the promise of a collision-free and rapid guidance to destinations/targets. For achieving rapid reaching of desired destinations in on-deck traffic, or of flying targets, the PI#s new technique of #prescribed-time# stabilization, using time-varying feedback, provides feedback controllers with guarantees of convergence in arbitrary user-prescribed time. These controllers are rigorous generalizations of the classical Proportional Navigation feedback from missile guidance. Theyoutperform sliding mode control and other nonsmooth techniques by making the convergence time independent of the initial condition (i.e., of the vehicle position and orientation), rejecting disturbances of unknown bounds (both deterministic and stochastic), and ensuring jerk-free arrival at the target, when desired (as in on-deck aircraft traffic). For guaranteeing a collision-free operationof vehicles and teams, namely, #safety,# the PI#s recently introduced techniques of prescribed-time safety, fixed-time safety, and inverse optimal safety greatly expand the control designer#s toolkit for high-performance guidance of ground and air vehicles. Existing techniques for ensuring #asymptotic safety# or #exponential safety,# using control barrier functions (CBF) and quadratic programming (QP) suffer from several limitations: (1) needless sacrifice of performance, (2) lack of optimality over the time interval of operation, (3) lack of design flexibility. These limitations are recognized in the literature by the creators of these methods themselves. The PI addresses the collision-free design of on-deck traffic controllers and aerial multi-vehicle engagement scenarios using his new methodologies for the design of prescribed-time and fixed-time #safety filters.# These control algorithms act as overrides on the user#s nominal control actions, as is the case with QP-CBF controllers, but much less conservatively. Rather than keeping the system from ever getting close to the obstacles (i.e., in finite time), these prescribed- and fixed-time safety filters permit the operator to get close to the obstacle in finite time, so as to accomplish the primary task of reaching the desired destination/targetas fast as possible. As in high-performance driving/racing. Additionally, the PI#s techniques of #inverse optimal# safety filter design ensure that, in addition to guaranteeing safety, the control input is not only the closest possible to the user#s commanded input at each time instant, without anticipating the deviation in the future, but guarantee that, over the entire period of operation, the user#s command is followed as closely as safely feasible. This inverse optimal approach enhances both the performance and safety. Furthermore, the inverse optimal approach does not produce only a single, inflexible control formula. It provides a family of safety filters with a user-tunable tradeoff between safety and performance. The project will design controllers for on-deck traffic management and for n-on-m aerial target pursuit using a variety of models: fully actuated, nonholonomic, dynamic with uncertain aerodynamics, in 2D and 3D, with obstacles that move and whose #safety bubbles# account for not only the position but also for orientation and the state of the propulsion system. The control algorithms will be tested with mobile robots in the PI#s lab and in a 2,500 cubicmeter Aerodrome at the PI#sless",

The data to support the research was collected over a period of a decade in the global ocean and, particularly, the Pacific. The instruments used in this work were collected by ocean bottom seismographs in shallow ( 100m) and deep water ( 6km) for extended periods (a year). The sensors used for this work included both hydrophones (pressure gauges) and accelerometers. The instrumentation was designed to have very low noise levels across a very broad band of frequencies extending from tides to 50Hz. While traditional data analyses have been conducted on these data for individual instruments, the use of many instruments at common times has been beyond the scope of traditional methods. We intend to exploit new methods in Deep Learning or Artificial Intelligence (AI), to analyze combinations of instruments to understand better phenomena that include tidal noise and signals generated by ships. In many cases, commercial ship positions are available globally through the AIS system. Archives of these data can be used to check the accuracy of the seafloor data that we have collected. Deep learning networks have been used for image classification for many years, they are powerful tools for signal data as well. A deep learning network can do everything a mathematical or physics model can do without requiring the scientist to know which signal features should be brought into the physical model.

        "abstract": "Shape Recovery and Image Understanding with non-Lambertian Reflectance Ravi Ramamoorthi University of California, San Diego A grand challenge for image analysis and machine vision is to fully understand and interpret the visual world, with applications in automated image understanding, surveillance and reconaissance. Real-world surfaces have a range of complex appearances, such as the shiny reflections from a velvet cushion, the translucent appearance of human skin, or the glossy reflections of a polished metal surface, all of which are common challenges in the maritime domain. Modeling a range of objects in natural outdoor and indoor conditions requires understanding the physics of light reflection from surfaces of varying material properties\u2014more formally, we must have a handle on non-Lambertian reflectance. Moreover, current systems for higher-level computer vision tasks such as shape recovery, recognition of people and actions, or segmentation of objects are all reaching the point where progress requires treating the physics of image-formation as a first-class primitive. New sensing primitives available in the past couple of years give us hope of substantially addressing this challenge. First, light field sensors or multi-camera arrays have or will soon become available to the consumer market (either stand-alone as in the Lytro microlens light field camera or integrated into mobile phones as in the Pelican Camera Array). This is a revolution in imaging, wherein a number of closely related viewpoints are acquired in a single shot capture. This allows us to tease out the effect of specularity, based on the different appearance from nearby views, a capability that has not previously existed. Moreover, acquisition is passive, allowing the methods we develop to work in the wild and in the outdoors, which is key in naval sensing applications. In a similar vein, one can imagine systems to position nearby differential light sources (perhaps in a mobile device with close by flashes, integrated with light field sensors). The PI\u2019s initial work on differential photometric stereo shows that a method that has theoretical guarantees of shape recovery for arbitrary reflectance properties can be formulated. The proposal will address threemajor technical challenges related to non-Lambertian reflectance from light field and differential image sensors. We will develop theoretical foundations, providing precise information about what properties of shape can be recovered from general BRDFs, leveraging our foundational results on differential photometric stereo and optical flow, and generalizing to differential viewpoint change, and numerically stable differential invariants. We will build practical algorithms for shape recovery from light field data (a nearby or differential set of viewpoints). A key idea is that one has multiple cues simultaneously in a single shot like depth from defocus and correspondence; also multiple viewpoints for specular and transparent objects. Finally, we will investigate image understanding and 3D model building. The potential of easy 3D acquisition for general non-Lambertian objects, potentially enables a rich new ecosystem of 3D geometry instead of still images. More interesting, 3D information especially around edges can greatly enhance performance of higher-level image understanding tasks like recognition and segmentation. The PI is uniquely qualified for this proposal, having developed some of the foundational results on reflectance and lighting in computer vision, including spherical harmonic lighting and differential invariants. He has also been recognized with the ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award in Computer Graphics. Much of this work was done under earlier ONR PECASE and Young Investigator Awards; the success of these projects also show that he can work with ONR and appreciate basic research with future naval relevance.less",

The six wave component can serve as an analog RF signal over optical fiber signal transmission link for ultra wideband signals. The 4 wave mixing component will demonstrate enhanced detection capability for fast, non-repeated pulses via analog processing. ApproachThe 6 wave work aims to produce an analog over fiber link that preserves the noise characteristics of the input signals, rather than amplify them, by limiting the injection of noise during the amplification in the signal amplitude quadrature and instead squeezing it into the phase domain, then eliminating that excess in the final photo-detection phase via interferometric techniques. Doing this requires extremely careful phase control over more than 2THz and use of 2 pump lasers. The 4 wave mixing work will seek to demonstrate that optical analog manipulation of pulsed signals can allow coincident spectral energy in different channels to be summed into a single one, increasing the detectability of that pulse.ObjectiveThe objective is to demonstrate the concept for 2 improved optical analog processing components recently invented as a result of ONR funded basic research. The optical link is to be tested in conjunction with a more conventional link at SSC in an ONR FY15 one shot.Overall Merit and ONR Mission/RelevanceThe optical link may be critical to utilize in any antenna remoting effort, especially for frequencies above 20 GHz when electrical cable losses are too extreme and space for a receiver at the antenna feed is impossible to plan. The 4 wave mixing idea has the possibility of increasing the detection possibility of single pulse end-state seekers, a strong interest of the platform protection community.

Chemical and biological contaminants often pollute the marine environment and are a major threat to the health of divers. Chemical contaminants often arise from Navy shipyards, oil spills, industrial pollution, or natural sources. Biological contaminants derive from raw human sewage or agricultural fecal run-off, or blooms of toxic ocean bacteria or algae. Importantly, standard diving equipment does not protect against these contaminants. Divers can ingest harmful amounts of these contaminants via respirator use, absorb them onto the skin or into the blood via seawater trapped beneath wetsuits, or inhale them via the air that resides above contaminated water sources. Unfortunately, contaminants often go undetected in dive sites because the current technologies for detecting them are expensive, time consuming, and require off-site laboratory analyses.Here, we propose to engineer a portable biosensor device that will detect multiple common chemical and biological contaminants of concern in seawater in less than one hour. We will leverage recent synthetic biology advances from the Tabor laboratory to engineer bacteria to sense up to 20 common monoaromatic organic and heavy metal contaminants. For the device, we will re-engineer a recent microfluidic system from the Hasty lab capable of detecting freshwater contaminants to be portable and operate in seawater. The device will automatically analyze seawater contaminant levels using a machine learning method recently developed in the Hasty laboratory. An end-user will utilize an intake system to sample raw seawater, and in ~30 minutes, the device will then report the overall risk of a diver entering the water. We will validate our system sing contaminated field samples collected from Navy-relevant seawater sites. Finally, we will engineer the device to function for at least 30 days without the need for servicing, which will make it useful for a wide range of Navy applicationsless",

This interrelationship between the structure and dynamic functions is particularly important in biological systems such as the human brain, where localized disturbances and transient aberrations of the connectivity structure may lead to severe neurological disorders, such as epileptic seizures. Interventions to treat these conditions are possible, yet difficult to optimize and actuate due to dimensionality, under-actuated and inaccurate control capabilities, unmodeled dynamics and spatial dependencies, and time-varying physical/functional structures. To address these challenges, the goal of this project is to develop novel methodologies and tools to analyze and control time-varying network systems. The state of the art in network control relies predominantly on a passive viewpoint of the time-varying nature of complex networks, where time-varying topologies are considered a given fact that needs to be dealt with. Instead, our approach relies on time-varying interconnections and actuation as an opportunity to understand the reasons behind specific network changes and to actively shape its functionality. The emphasis is on time-varying networks, where the dependency on time appears in the dynamics of the single nodes, in the interconnections between them, or as a combination of the two mechanisms. The project seeks to characterize the benefits and limitations of time-varying actuation (actuating different nodes at different times) and time-varying interconnection (activating different edges at different times). If successful, the research of this project will significantly enhance our ability to quickly adapt intervention strategies and deal with time-varying model uncertainties in complex networks across multiple application domains.less",

With the recent thrust in ultra-low power Internet of Things (IoT)-like devices, there is an urgent need to be able to accurately characterize these devices at very low power levels (e.g., nanowatt and picowatt) and in complex environments (e.g., with interference present, networked with other devices, etc.). UCSD is a world-renowned research university and currently has several federally funded research projects in this area that would benefit from adding this equipment infrastructure. For example, a recently published wake-up radio developed as part of a DARPA award demonstrated state-of-the-art performance besting prior art by over an order of magnitude in both sensitivity and power. This wake-up receiver consumes less than 10 nW of power ??? the equivalent power loss of a coin cell battery sitting on a desk with nothing connected to it! The requested equipment, a multichannel arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) would enable us to characterize this device in realistic deployment scenarios such as when surrounded by interfering communications and even tactical countermeasure techniques such as jamming. The multichannel feature of this equipment would also facilitate the testing of networks of these wakeup receiver nodes as might be used in infrastructure monitoring or battleground deployment.less",

As a photodetector, the device has shown excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, gain, frequency response, efficiency, and scalability. Above all, the device has shown the ability to detect single photons at high speed. One key area that needs significant improvement is its dark current, which is 1000 to 10,000 times greater than the desired value. To address this critical problem, we propose a research project to answer the following two questions: (a) where the dark current come from and (b) how to find practical approaches to reduce its magnitude to meet the target value. We find the answer of the first question by analyzing data from temperature dependent dark current measurements. Our preliminary investigations point out that tunneling current is the dominant factor for the high dark current of CEP devices because of the thin (typically 30nm) gain medium and the high E-field. Hence our focus here will be to suppress electron and hole tunneling via direct (band-to-band) or indirect (band-to-local states) pathways. We will develop schemes to cut down all possible tunneling paths. In addition, any scheme that suppresses tunneling should not compromise other device performance such as quantum efficiency, CEP gain, frequency response, and sensitivity. By solving the dark current problem, we will be able to realize the full potential of the CEP detectors for a wide range of applications including imaging, sensing, and optical communications.less",

        "abstract": "Understanding fundamental processes that occur in our water systems is important if we are to predict and mitigate any harm. In particular, what occurs on geochemical interfaces can often be the factors that control many environmental processes which are critical to water quality and treatment as well as the fate and transport of contaminants. It is well known that the chemistry at these interfaces is complex due to the presence of many different components present in water systems. In these studies, a multi-prong approach is proposed to understand geochemical interfaces in complex environments and their role in the transformation of volatile chemical products recently detected in abundance in air. Although these compounds are initially found in air, some of these can easily partition into water systems. Therefore, we are interested in studying how these type of chemicals interact with different geochemical interfaces in the aqueous phase. The goal of the proposed activities will be to better understand molecular processes on geochemical interfaces and to better understand the chemistry that occurs at geochemical interfaces in complex multi-component environments. Delineation of the molecular steps and processes of surface adsorption/desorption, surface displacement and surface catalysis is important if a fundamental understanding of geochemical interfaces in complex environments and the transformation of chemical contaminants on geochemical interfaces can be achieved. The two main objectives of this research are to: (i) develop and integrate different vibrational spectroscopies to study the chemistry of geochemical interfaces in complex media that contain natural organic matter, oxyanions and biological components and; (ii) investigate transformations of key chemical products on geochemical interfaces under different conditions. We plan to build up chemical complexity by investigating multi-component adsorption at the aqueous geochemical interface using vibrational spectroscopy as a probe. In addition, we propose to develop new methods to study the chemistry of geochemical interfaces. In particular, we plan to combine Attenuated Total Reflection\u00d0Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with Atomic Force Microscopy-Infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy and Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) to investigate a range of components found in aqueous-geochemical systems. Integrating these approaches will be particularly helpful in discerning the nature of these interactions at geochemical interface that are important to water quality and the fate and transport of contaminants.less",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline materials have generated great research interests due to their potentials to achieve superior properties. However, such materials are generally prone to grain growth at low or even room temperatures, rendering them impractical for many applications. Inhibiting grain growth becomes a greater challenge at higher temperatures. Built on the success of recent original work in the PI group, the proposed project aims to exploit a potentially-transformative concept of utilizing high-entropy grain boundaries (HEGBs) to stabilize nanocrystalline alloys (nanoalloys) at high temperatures (above 1000 C). The central scientific hypothesis is that HEGBs can be utilized to greatly increase the temperature stability of nanoalloys, thereby enabling their applications at high temperatures. More specifically, HEGBs can accommodate more adsorption within the bulk solid solubility limit, which can (i) not only reduce grain boundary energy as the thermodynamic driving force for grain growth (ii) but also enlarge the solute-drag effect to inhibit grain growth. Such HEGB-enhanced adsorption can be utilized to counter the detrimental temperature-induced desorption, thereby stabilizing nanoalloys at high temperatures. In addition to Type I multinary nanoalloys (with one principal and multiple segregating elements), bulk high-entropy effects in Type II high-T stable multinary nanoalloys (with multiple principal and one or more segregating elements) can lower the bulk chemical potentials to suppress precipitation to enable more grain boundary adsorption within the bulk solid solubility limit. The newly-proposed stabilization mechanisms in both Type I and Type II multinary nanoalloys have the same physical origin: to promote grain boundary adsorption with respect to the precipitation of secondary phases, thereby decreasing the grain boundary energy and increasing the solute drag. This project aims to validate the above scientific hypothesis and further establish a new coupled thermodynamic and kinetic theory and associated models to guide the design of new HEGB-stabilized high-T nanoalloys. In an additional high-risk and high-return thrust, amorphous-like HEGBs will be exploited to stabilize multinary nanoalloys to even higher temperatures. Using Ni-based multinary nanoalloys as the initial model system, this project will (1) develop a new coupled thermodynamic and kinetic theory and associated models for HEGBs, conduct both (2a) numerical and (2b) physical experiments and characterization to validate the hypothesis and models, and further (3) develop criteria for selecting alloying elements to stabilize nanoalloys at high temperatures via utilizing HEGBs. The model system(s) for experiments may be adjusted based on the initial experimental feedbacks. The successful completion of this project will establish a new theoretical framework that is transferable to a broad range of other materials to enable the use of HEGBs to stabilize nanoalloys at high temperatures, with broad technological impacts.less",

        "abstract": "The Arabian Sea exchanges heat and fresh water with the Bay of Bengal through a strong boundary current system that passes around Sri Lanka. The ASTraL program recognizes the importance of these exchange flows, and their seasonal changes, to the ocean stratification in the \u201cmini warm pool area\u201d of the Arabian Sea. However, probably around 50% of the freshwater flux happens in the inner 50km of the boundary current which cannot be sampled with gliders. In addition, satellite salinity cannot resolve the low-salinity cores of nearshore flows of with expected 20km scales. Here, an observational system is proposed that builds on previous efforts in the ASIRI and MISO-BoB initiatives and would close these gaps. This system seeks to fully monitor the flow and transport of salt and freshwater for several years, to assess its variability and provide the results as benchmarks to other ASTraL projects. There are substantial uncertainties in present knowledge of the variability of both the currents and their salinity in the nearshore region south of Sri Lanka, where the signal is largest. Data from further offshore exist from the previous ASIRI and MISO-BoB programs, using both gliders and pressure-sensing inverted echo sounders (PIES). These have been analyzed together with a reanalysis model to guide and justify the proposed work. We intend to re-deploy a pair of seafloor PIES from MISO-BoB in a location that brings them closer to shore, and to augment these with a near-shore mooring that measures currents and salinity directly at one location. This can fill the gaps and quantify the salinity transport in the inner 50km of the boundary current south of Sri Lanka. It needs to be paired with glider observations farther offshore on the same section, as had been done in ASIRI and MISO-BOB. The planned duration of the field observations is three years, consisting of one three-year deployment of the PIES and three successive, nominally one-year, mooring deployments. The work is carried out in collaboration with partners in Sri Lanka. This research addresses the following of the ASTraL science questions, by providing the observational data needed from the boundary currents off Sri Lanka: What processes control the maintenance and dissipation of the Arabian Sea warm pool? What exchange processes are misrepresented in coupled models leading to moisture & precipitation dry biases in forecasts?less",

        "abstract": "Over 60 years ago, major theoretical results in the control and optimization areas developed the link between the solution of continuous time-space, nonlinear control problems and the solution of associated Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) and-or the solution of associated two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs), including those of the Pontryagin maximum principle. Conversion of the control problem to one of these alternatives was expected to lead to solution of the originating nonlinear control problem. However, it was soon learned that the computational complexity of these formulations was typically prohibitive. The HJ PDE formulation is the more generally applicable of these approaches, particularly in the case of stochastic control problems. However, the application of standard solution methods to these HJ PDE problems is subject to the curse of dimensionality, which limits their successful application to only exceptionally low-dimensional problems. Perhaps the earliest, successful approach to addressing this issue was the max-plus based curse-of-dimensionality-free (CODF) method. The effectiveness of that approach has been validated, extended and improved by multiple research teams cf. [2, 3, 4, 15, 19, 31, 58, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71]. Other research teams have more recently addressed the curse of dimensionality. Examples include [1, 8, 9, 22, 23, 34, 37, 40] among many notable others. Although there has been substantial success on deterministic control problems and their associated rst-order HJ PDEs, there has been less success in the case of stochastic control problems driven by Brownian motion. The issue that arises in adaption of the max-plus based CODF methods to stochastic control problems is a curse of complexity induced by a necessary application of a max-plus distributive property at each time-step [58, 62]. Related approaches that attempt to attenuate this e ect through other means include those of Akian et al. [2, 3, 4]. A radically different approach to this difficulty has recently come to light. Quite unexpectedly, we have found a means for conversion of certain second-order HJ PDEs to 1st-order HJ PDEs over a set of dual variables. In some cases, this conversion is exact. In the case where the non-quadratic components can be con nected to the zeroth order term, the conversion is exact modulo solution of a linear, non-homogeneous heat equation, which is not difficult.less",

GRANT#13800982.--The use of episode-based machine learning is being investigated for the purpose of discovering new control laws for active open-loop control of jet noise from complex nozzles. This study takes place within a numerical simulation environment that was previously developed, using large-eddy simulation to predict the noise emissions of a supersonic rectangular twin-jet. The simulation has proven to be highly accurate, with predictions matching experimental results to within two dB over a range of polar angles. To build on this, we are proposing a research design that incorporates expert knowledge into the latest generation of model-free machine learning algorithms. The focus is on finding new control laws for reducing or redirecting noise by harnessing new actuation strategies like symmetry-breaking. Two machine learning paradigms, deep reinforcement learning and gradient-enriched genetic programming, have shown efficiency and effectiveness in previous studies of active flow control and will be considered. The implementation of an episode-based learning approach enables the reinforcement-learning or genetic-programming agent to be informed by both simulation and experimental data. If desired, and through close collaboration with our experimental partners, some of the learning data can be provided by the experiment in a hybrid simulation effort. This high-risk, high-reward research project is, to our knowledge, the first known attempt to apply machine learning control to such a complex engineering system.less",

These systems can be regarded as part of a new generation of quantum molecular materials which exhibit hybrid physicochemical properties at room-temperature that neither of their bare components feature, and thus, are attractive from both a fundamental and a technological standpoint. In this proposal, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework to understand the emergent linear and nonlinear optical properties of vibrational polaritons in realistic thermal and lossy environments, as well as the novel opportunities thatthese vibrational polariton systems offer in terms of control or modification of remote vibrational energy transfer and chemical reactivity. This effort requires novel theoretical studies at the crossroads of a variety of disciplines, including theoretical chemistry, solid state physics, quantum optics, and nanophotonics. The payout is expected to be high, presumably including unprecedented ways of processing infrared photons, designing new molecular spectroscopies, transferring vibrational energy, or making and breaking chemical bonds.

However, this sampling modality has limited ability to traverse different environments or depths within a mission, limited spatial coverage, and little-to-no data availability in real time. There is a need for small, low power, high-quality acoustic recording units with real-time processing for integration into a suite of mobile and profiling assets increasingly in use by DoD.A modular, miniaturized instrument design, termed miniHARP, based on Scripps# High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package, is proposed. The miniHARP can continuously and simultaneously sample four hydrophone channels at 200 kHz, as well as a tilt sensor, at extremely low power (<1W). The real-time miniHARP will store full resolution data internally (up to 8 TB) and output a full resolution real-time data stream via standard network protocols over Ethernet. An onboard deep learning-optimized (DL) open source compute module, programmable by end users, will receive the output data stream. Analytical results from computing operations such as event detections, classifications and bearings can be relayed to a surface expression, glider, or used for autonomous event triggering. The real-time miniHARP will have the appropriate size, adaptability, and longevity for deployment on profiling systems, gliders, and drifters. The real-time aspects of the system also lend themselves to integration with long term installations such as offshore wind infrastructure. Two demonstration deployments of the real-time miniHARP are proposed: First, the system will be mounted on a Wirewalker, with continuous recordings taken while the system transits vertically through the water column, and one towed by a Wave Glider, with the miniHARP system#s communications connected to the glider#s operating system, for real time data transfer.Example use cases include real-time detection and/or measurement of sounds produced by marine mammals and fish, human activities such as commercial shipping, or physical processes such asweather events.

        "abstract": "Understanding the roles of topography on the ocean general circulation is challenging because of the multiscale nature of the flow interactions. Small-scale details of the topography, and the waves, drag, and turbulence generated at the boundaries, from meter scale to mesoscale, interact in the boundary layers to influence the larger-scale flow. We propose to use modern modeling and state estimation methods at multiple scales for collaborative study of the interaction of significant currents with steep topography in the western Tropical Pacific. We will run a nested set of models for the region, starting with the entire Tropical Pacific at 1/3o resolution in order to resolve the large-scale circulation, primarily wind-driven flows. We will take boundary conditions from this outer model (as well as the HYCOM/NCODA global analysis) to run a nested model with 1/6o resolution, and then continue to increase resolution down to scales approaching 4.5 km (1/24o resolution) to supply boundary conditions to even finer-scale models, such as Delft3d, applied to local regions. We will use state estimation tools to fit the models to observations before and during the fieldwork to produce reanalyses for dynamical diagnostics and to compute sensitivities of key circulation features to both local and remote ocean-atmospheric forcings. Our scientific goals are to understand ocean circulation near islands and abrupt topography, including the effects of the topography on the large-scale flow. Success will be defined by skillful predictive models, including generalization of the \"island rule\", and to contribute to studies of the small-scale circulation around islands.less",

First, because the human body (e.g., torso versus extremities) undergoes complex motions at different regions, wearable sensors that can not only be worn that those locations but alsoacquire high quality movement data will be developed. Three form factors, namely compression-garment-based, tattoo-like thin films, and adhesive-patch-based wearable sensors, will be investigated. Second, the different wearable substrates mean that different nanocomposite thin film strain sensor fabrication approaches (as well as nanocomposite formulations to attain high performance) will be developed to best integrate the sensing element. Third, geometrical patterning will be employed to enhance sensor performance attributes while minimizing ambient (temperature) effects that would otherwisecontaminate the sensing streams acquired. Fourth, depending on the location-of-interest and the types of motion to be quantified, patterning of the wearable sensors and unique measurement strategies will be implemented to best characterize full-field bodily or muscular motion. The aim is to acquire as few measurements as possible while using tomographic methods and the entire patterned nanocomposite to realize a spatially distributed sensor. Then, a miniature and portable wireless data acquisition node will be prototyped for interfacing with the wearable sensors and for facilitating real-timemeasurements in variable environments. Last, the performance of the suite of wearable sensors will be characterized by extensive static and dynamic laboratory-based tests, before they are validated on human subjects recruited through collaborations with UC San Diego Athletics and the Naval Health Research Center.less",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Proposed is the procurement of two new moorings that will enable concurrent, integrated cetacean-prey studies in the Southern California Bight (SCB). The proposed moorings will each consist of (1) a passive acoustic system for the study of cetaceans, (2) active acoustic systems for estimation of prey abundance, (3) conductivity-temperature-depth recorders for links to oceanographic water masses, and (4) a redundant acoustic release system. The passive acoustic system will be the High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP), mounted near the bottom of the mooring at approximately 1,000 m depth. The HARP is capable of continuous 320 kHz recording, allowing sufficient bandwidth for detecting all cetacean sounds found in the SCB, up to 6 months. The active acoustic system will consist of two multiple-frequency echosounders (AZVP units, ASL Environmental Sciences), one at full depth, just above the HARP, and the other 300 m from the surface. Both systems will have upward-looking 38 and 200 kHz echosounders. This will allow abundance estimation of krill and other baleen whale prey in shallow water, as well monitoring for daily movements and migrations, particularly of the deep-scattering layer. At depth, the echosounder will collect data to estimate biomass of prey (e.g. squid) for deep-diving cetaceans. Finally, conductivity-temperature-depth recorders (CTD, SeaBird MicroCAT SBE37-SM) will be deployed at the same depths as the active echosounder units. These moorings will enable the collection of long-term concurrent data on marine mammal presence and behavior in relation to prey fields and environmental features, which are currently very costly to obtain. The instruments will also support research projects for Scripps Institution of Oceanography\u2019s graduate students and will allow training of well-rounded acoustician-ecologists capable of handling a broad range of ecosystem questions and studies.less",

To determine if these vertical motions and associated transport processes are properly represented in predictive systems, new in situ observations are needed to accurately measure the physical processes involved as well as for testing theories, hypotheses, and predictions of the threedimensional time-evolving Lagrangian pathways.

        "abstract": "Microorganisms engage in complex interactions with other organisms and their environment. Recent studies have demonstrated that these interactions are reaching beyond the simple exchange of electron donors. Complex intertwined exchanges of amino acids, vitamins, and other cofactors lay the foundation microbial communities are build on. These interactions are not static but are highly dynamic in nature and change over time. Same as our own network of social interaction changes and evolves over time, so is the microbial interaction network changing. Nutritional requirements that are hardwired into the genome thus define the network microbes will engage in and contribute significantly to community assembly and maintenance. Currently we lack a deeper understanding about the requirements of microorganisms and how these requirements differ between different strains and different environments. More importantly, we do not know which microbes interact with each other and who would replace the function of a microbe when it is reduced in abundance or removed from a community. Thus we lack the ability to predict keystone species in most microbial communities. There are currently no adequate tools that enable the target reduction or elimination of a specific microorganism from a community and study the effect on the environment. Here we propose to deploy a new method developed by our laboratory that enables targeted depletion or enrichment of specific microorganisms from a community. The method takes advantage of the fact that all bacterial cells contain highly specific glycan binding proteins, i.e. lectins. These lectin-glycan interactions can be as specific as the interaction between antigen-antibody or substrate-enzyme. Gylcans are the most functionally and structurally diverse molecules in biology and are a hallmark of every living cell. We have recently shown that a unique high density and flexible display of glycans enhances multivalent interactions with bacteria and archaea, and thus enables capture of microorganisms based on their glycan binding specificity. We will utilize this array to specifically change the composition of the skin microbiome and follow its dynamics over time in a mouse model. The targeted and gradual removal of members of the microbiome will enable systematical studies of the effect individual species have on community composition and robustness of the microbiome. It will allow delineating outcomes different microorganisms have on community assembly and maintenance and evaluate the effect on the community when the most abundant organism or a keystone species is gradually depleted. Quantitative information generated in this project, e.g. gene expression data, will be used to constrain genome-scale metabolic models for key members of the community. Using a systems biology approach we will gain mechanistic insight into the effect species deletion/enrichment has on community composition. If successful the project will provide answers to fundamental question in microbiome research. We will gain knowledge about how microbial communities are assembled and maintained. Furthermore, we will provide insights into how the community responses to perturbation and what role individual members play in this response. Overall the proposed work will generate a deeper understanding of microbial community composition and function and it will provide the basic knowledge and mechanistic understanding needed for microbiome interventions and design strategies.less",

        "abstract": "Next Generation Neuromorphic Chips based on Compute-in-memory Architecture with Bulk Switching Resistive Memory ArraysPublicly Releasable AbstractIn this proposal, we request funding to cover manufacturing and testing costs of a next-generation neuromorphic chip based on CMOS-RRAM integration. This new chip will integrate high density RRAM arrays at the top of CMOS neuron circuits to perform training and inference with high throughput and low energy consumption in resource limited settings. Our current ONR grant on developing computational models of hippocampus microcircuits based on brain inspired next generation deep learning has led to exciting results in the areas of device technologies and neuromorphic architectures. We demonstrated that CMOS-RRAM based neurosynaptic core with dynamically reconfigurable dataflow that can achieve an extremely high energy efficiency (74 TMACS/W). We developed a new bulk switching resistive memory technology that can enable implementation of online learning in the hardware with substantially greater energy efficiency and bandwidth than other deep learning/AI approaches. This new memory technology will be integrated with massively parallel distributed and hierarchically structured neuromorphic architecture to fundamentally advance the state-of-the-art neuromorphicchips. In our ONR project we aim to develop this next generation neuromorphic chips, which will provide (i) capability for persistent online learning through continuous weight updates; and (ii) efficient implementation in massively parallel distributed and hierarchically structured CMOS architecture, operating entirely on local variables. If successful, this next generation neuromorphic chip will offer tremendous potential in overcoming mounting challenges in the natural intelligence and persistent autonomy of unmanned fleet/swarm Navy operations in environments where direct human participation would pose great risk to warfighter health/survival and/or to mission effectiveness. Requested funding will be used to manufacture chips at CMOS foundries, to integrate bulk RRAM devices atthe top of CMOS chips at UC San Diego Nanofabrication facility, and to acquire test equipment needed to test high density memory arrays. To-date, we have demonstrated proof-of-concepts for individual components of this project. However, integration of neuromorphic CMOS circuits with bulk switching RRAM technology requires dedicated funding for covering chip manufacturing costs. In addition, lack of high speed and low noise electrical characterization equipment limits our abilities to conduct accurate longitudinal measurements with precise control over large numbers of RRAM elements, especially the new bulk switching devices that have a wider dynamic range of operation. The requested funds in this DURIP proposal will provide the complete test setup and manufacturing resources necessary to build the next generation neuromorphic chips with online learning capability.less",

The proposed approach is designed to obtain critical observations from a complex multi-sensor array covering a region within which fixed and moving assets like moorings and floats deployed by other NISKINE investigators will operate and in concert with the planned cruises. Improving our dynamical understanding of how the energy in the near-inertial band is proportioned between the generation of mixed-layer oscillations, radiating waves, and turbulent dissipation is of paramount importance. In order to make significant progress in this regard, the following physical quantities can be constrained with our approach: 1) Work done by the wind at the observation site (large scale). This is required to constrain the atmospheric energy input, an essential ingredient for closing the energy budget. 2) Onset and evolution of inertial oscillations in the mixed layer. This is needed to constrain the amount of energy dissipated by radiation of NIW generated by the inertial oscillations and turbulence at the base of the mixed layer. 3) The vorticity associated with the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale background velocity field outside of the near-inertial band. This is required to understand the interaction of inertial oscillations and NIW with the background flow and the resulting effective nearinertial frequency. Specifically, we want to quantify how the presence of eddies reduces the horizontal spatial coherence of the NIW. Furthermore, drifter measurements of sea surface temperature, atmospheric air pressure and wind will be posted in real-time to the Global Telecommunication System, and will be available to the Navy and our Icelandic partner and leading institutions and centers worldwide for assimilation into operational models.less",

Mapping the temporal and spatial variability of the boundary layer in situ requires specialized equipment that can elucidate variability on small lateral, vertical, and temporal scales over prolonged periods. Under previous ONR support, we have developed a rapid profiling system for regional and global class vessels. This system is driven by a direct-drive electric winch and can profile a CTD or turbulence package up to 2 km depth as rapidly as 6-8 m/s. Here we propose to design and build a medium duty, portable, multi-use, modular winch (modWinch) for use on coastal vessels and ships of opportunity. Like the full-scale system, it will use a direct-drive transmission and be capable of ultra-_ne tension control over a large dynamic range. It will be designed as an integrated winch/level-wind/control system package, and, crucially, will be feature a combination optical/electrical slip ring and swappable hubs for multiple uses. The winch would allow rapid profiling of our FastCTD package, our `epsi-fish' turbulence package, handle optical telemetry and power for our towed phased array sonar system, allow towed and subsurface fiber optic distributed temperature sensing, and serve as a spooler for Wirewalker operations. Sea-trials for the proposed winch will be conducted on Scripps Institution of Oceanography's recently commissioned coastal research vessel, the R/V Bob and Betty Beyster. It is envisioned that the winch will facilitate ONR and Naval research activities onboard the R/V Beyster and other coastal vessels by both the proposing group as well as other ONR PIs.less",

The 2 existing floats have already b een fabricated under ONR grant N00014-17-1-2700 and are ready for use in ARCTERX without further fabrication cost.

We demonstrated the assembly of autonomous and light-controlled microgears. We use this unique and versatile building block as the cornerstone to explore the guiding principles for assembly of spinning objects. Unlike equilibrium phases of matter, which stem from the balance between entropy and internal energy, the organization of self-spinning motors states arise from the competition between active torques and interactions.

        "abstract": "Merging computational models with observations is important in many problems of interest to theNavy. A prominent example is numerical weather prediction (NWP), where forecasts of tomorrowsweather are informed by measurements of todays atmospheric state. Merging simulations andobservations in this way can be achieved within a Bayesian framework, in which the computationalmodel and the observations jointly define a posterior distribution. The timely, and therefore navalrelevant, numerical solution of such a data assimilation (DA) problem is based on approximationsof a posterior distribution. Numerically, this is often done by ensemble methods, in particular byensemble Kalman filters (EnKF).A key requirement for the applicability of the EnKF to problems of interest to the Navy is thatthe ensemble size be moderate even if the numerical model is of a very high dimension. The reasonis that each ensemble member requires a simulation with the model, which is computationallyintensive. A small ensemble size, however, creates large sampling errors which cause spurious,long-range correlations and, ultimately, a poor forecast. The idea of covariance localization is toreduce sampling error by restricting correlations to relatively small neighborhoods, which effectivelyincreases the accuracy of ensemble covariances to exceed what one can expect from a small ensemblesize.Localization has lead to extreme gains in the computational efficacy of the EnKF and has enabled thesuccess of EnKF algorithms in NWP. There is, however, nearly no mathematical theory that justifiesthe use of localization. Within this project, I will create a mathematical theory for localization thatcan explain where the beneficial aspects of localization arise and under what conditions localizationshould be used. More generally, this project contributes to our understanding of how to effectivelysample random variables in high dimensional spaces, which is important in many problems inscience and engineering (besides NWP), e.g., in inverse problems in geophysics, model selection, orthe analysis of rare events.The proposed theoretical work is motivated by practical application. Through previous work andmany discussions with collaborators, it became apparent that a mathematical theory of localizationis particularly relevant to the Navy because it is needed to (i) effectively use localization inionospheric prediction; (ii) extend localization to nonlinear/non-Gaussian methods, such as particlefilters or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); and (iii) effectively leverage localization in multiscalesystems. The Earths ionosphere, which is the interface between the near space region and theEarths lower atmosphere, is critically important because it directly influences Over-The-Horizon-Radar (OTHR) characteristics, GPS signal propagation, and HF radio communication. Problems(ii) and (iii) are increasingly important for the Navys DA systems as the resolution of the Navysatmospheric and oceanic models increases to more tactically relevant temporal and spatial scales.This abstract is approved for public release.less",

This technique applies to both numerical and experimental data, similar to the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). Both POD and DMD extract important flow features and yield accurate low-dimensional representations of the nonlinear flow dynamics. However, neither POD nor DMD gives direct and quantitative insight into the nonlinear interactions that dictate these dynamics. BMD provides this critical capability. BMD was recently introduced and can identify the flow structures associated with the dominant frequency triads as well as their regions of interaction. Open cavity flows exhibit rich nonlinear dynamics comprised of complex interactions between shear-layer instabilities, acoustic pressure waves, and low-frequency oscillations. The stochastic nature of turbulent cavity flows further complicates this picture at the technically relevant Reynolds numbers considered in this work.less",

The multiscale variability in the wake of an obstacle is a product of turbulent bottom bound,ary layers on inclined slopes, coherent vortices shed from the obstacle, as well as barotropic and baroclinic instabilities of the,wake. We propose high-resolution, large eddy simulations (LES) to conduct a process study of wake dynamics which, unlike prior work,in oceanic wakes, will resolve turbulence. These high-resolution non-hydrostatic simulations enable quantification of turbulent diss,ipation, mixing, and drag as a function of topographic Rossby and Froude number. A newly developed hybrid approach will be utilized, to efficiently evolve near-wake turbulent vortices to the larger space and time scales of the intermediate and far wake. Both a uni,form current and a vertically sheared current with lateral variability of density will be considered. The spatio-temporal structure,of the wake will be examined using a variety of diagnostics including energy and momentum budgets, modal analysis and Lagrangian t,racers. We anticipate that the simulation results will be useful to constrain topographic drag and turbulence parameterizations in l,arge-scale ocean models as well as to interpret field observations during FLEAT and ARCTREX.less",

People require new combinations of skills so they can identify,, anticipate, support, undermine, and otherwise respond to social media content and campaigns. Although social media is largely techn,ologically-mediated, the core goals are human-centric: users aim to inform, influence, inspire, and inhibit other people, not techno,logical systems. As a result, any attempt to understand behaviors in social media and networks must invariably focus on the human mo,tivations, reasoning, and foibles that produce it. This research project will address two key questions:1. What types of trainingcl,assroom instruction, additional scaffolding on workflows, brief reminders, etc.are most effective at reducing problematic learning,, interpretation, and reasoning biases in information analysts?2. How should that training be integrated with training on relevant so,ftware tools for building situational awareness, predictive models, and usable hypotheses? Specifically, this project will result in, the development of a high-level education and training framework for sense-making, critical thinking, situational awareness, narrat,ive construction, narrative analysis, design of responses, and selection of course of action. The project will also develop appropri,ate educational and workflow interventions to improve core cognitive capabilities that are required in the social media domain.

This work is motivated by the need for consistent Very HighFrequency (VHF) underwater acoustic communications (UWCOMMS), defined here between100 kHz and 1 MHz. The wide bandwidths of VHF UWCOMMS can achieve both high datarates and low signal to noise ratio performance and the short acoustic wavelengths enable theconstruction of compact arrays for deployment on a wide range of platforms. However, VHFenergy in seawater is naturally limited by high rate of absorption which limits the range ofdetectability by hostile assets. The performance of VHF UWCOMMS systems depend onunderstanding the acoustics and physics of the channels the signals propagate through, which inturn rely on an understanding of the thermohaline structure of the water column and VHF noisesources in the soundscape. In Arctic coastal environments, little has been done to characterizeunderwater acoustic propagation around marine-terminating glaciers, where sound speed profilesare complicated by the mixing meltwater with tidally driven seawater flows. Meltwater drivesthe formation of seasonally-variable, freshwater lenses, which create transient and variablewaveguides near the sea surface. The proposed work aims to: I. Develop new methods forbroadband acoustic study of oceanic stratification, associated mixing phenomena, and the ice-water interface of tidewater glaciers, II. Inform on how sound propagation at high latitudes isimpacted by localized variability in water column structure through multi-scale processes, andIII.

Unfortunately, a key challenge to deploy ML in real-world is the large amount of labeled training data required to train complex deep learning models. We propose to develop a sample efficient physics-guided machine learning framework to learn from spatiotemporal data such as trajectories and videos. Our framework will learn complex spatiotemporal dynamics in various combat and non-combat scenarios, including autonomous vehicle tracking and navigation, multi-agent team behavior modeling, and atmospheric turbulence simulation. Our framework will drastically reduces learning sample complexity by infusing common sense physics knowledge into data-driven machine learning systems. Specifically, our scientific approach consists of three major components: (1) physics-guided data sampling: performing active learning guided by physical intuitions and querying data in the most informative spatiotemporal regions (2) physics-guided learning objective: incorporating physical constraints into the optimization objectives to guide the learning algorithms. and (3) physics-guided model architecture: designing novel neural network models that are guaranteed to preserve physical characteristics. Scientific Merit This proposal aims to advance the fundamental knowledge of spatiotemporal reasoning in environments with complex dynamics. The proposed research will lead to novel machine learning methods that can (1) significantly reduce the operational cost of labeling large amount of training data in the field (2) accurately predict the behavior of enemies or autonomous vehicles using rich spatiotemporal data collected from night vision sensors, weapons sights and navigational devices, and (3) tremendously expand our capabilities to model diverse unknown environment dynamics and heterogeneous behavior patterns. Broader Impact Algorithms and methodologies developed in this project will have a major impact on the theory and practice of large-scale spatiotemporal data analytics by integrating new concepts and tools from physics and machine learning. It will further contribute to our burgeoning understanding of spatiotemporal decision making, dynamical systems, large-scale optimization and properties of deep neural networks. Additionally, the PI plans to continue her outreach activities to facilitate dissemination of research findings to the scientific communities, including giving tutorials, organizing workshops, and teaching a graduate course on physics-guided learning. The project will also train a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups, who can break domain boundaries between physical sciences and machine learning, and contribute to the urging needs of homeland security and global resilience.less",

Prior experiments and theory for un correlated plasmas has characterized the important dynamical effects of electric fields, plasma flow shear and finite size (boundary) effects. One surprising dynamical effect is \"collisional caging\", where noise fluctuations cause particles to collide multiple times. Another surprising dynamical effect is that the ubiquitous \"diocotron\" mode can cause enhanced centrifugal separation of disparate mass species. This research will extend these dynamical perspectives into the lower temperature regime of strong inter particle collisionality. These experiments will be performed on research devices optimized for simplicity, controllability, and quantitative diagnostics.

        "abstract": "FY21 DURIP Funds for:Nanoindentation system for comprehensive mechanical characterizations of soft biologicaltissues with heteroge nous propertiesIn the DURIP proposal, we request funding to purchase a nanoindentation system forcharacterizing and analyzing the distribution of mechanical properties of soft biological tissues.Such characterizing capabilities are critical for constructing a high-fidelity human digital twin,which are indispensable for the numerical simulations of human bodies subject to variousmechanic al loadings. To demonstrate the new research capabilities in the PIs lab, in the project,we will use the nanoindentation system to obtain high resolution maps of frequency-dependentloss modulus, storage modulus, phase lag angle, water mobility and fracture toug hness of porcineliver and kidney.The nanoindentation system will also greatly enhance the research capabilities of currentlyfunde d projects by the DoD that the PI has been involved in. Those DoD funded projects includeinvestigating cavitation in soft materials and tissues, designing artificial muscle for biomimeticsoft robots and creating stimuli-responsive mechanical metamaterials. The r equestednanoindentation system will allow us to accurately characterize the local mechanical properties ofvarious materials in all those ongoing projects. We will also make the nanoindentation systemaccessible to other researchers from the PIs institute. It ha s been evident that their researchprojects funded by the DoD or other agencies can also greatly benefit from the capabilities of th erequested nanoindentation system.Furthermore, the PI will introduce the nanoindentation system, the corresponding experimentalte chnique and the underlying theoretical foundations in the courses being regularly taught at UCSDby the PI. The undergraduate and gr aduate researchers working in the PIs lab will receiveprofessional trainings on operating the facility and conducting data analysi s. Such experience canbe extremely valuable for those students who may work on the areas of interest to the DoD.It is understood t hat any developmental items and specially designed parts, components,accessories and attachments fabricated under any Department of Defense award resulting from thisproposal are being developed for civil or potential military applications.Budget JustificationT he requested budget is completely based on the quote from the vendor as attached. 100%of the requested fund will be used to purchas e the Nanoindentation System as listed in theproject narrative. Additional cost for the maintenance of the Nanoindentation System i n thefuture will be covered by future federal funds such as the funds from NSF, DOE and DoD.In addition to that, the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCSDcommits to provide a one-year fellowship to a graduate student to conduct the research described in the project narrative.less",

Auxiliary products such as the gravity-to-topography correlation coefficient, are used by the by the Naval Research Laboratory as part of their global seafloor characterization program. Moreover, our predicted bathymetry model is used as the foundation layer for the GEBCO/Seabed 2030 project and we are collaborating with the four GEBCO data centers to expand and improve the coastal and deep ocean bathymetry sounding data -base and to highlight uncharted areas for future surveys. Satellite altimetry provides the best means for deriving these models at global scale and over the last 25 years, we have developed the necessary infrastructure to process all available altimetry data for optimal gravity field recovery and bathymetry prediction. Over the next 3 years, three currently operating satellite altimeters CryoSat-2, SARAL/Altika and Sentinel-3 will provide a wealth of new marine gravity data. In addition, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, due to launch in September 2021, will begin providing next Generation, swath altimetry data that will revolutionize space based gravity field recovery. We will also continue to assemble what is likely the largest set of edited global depth soundings (shallow and deep ocean) from a wide variety of sources. These soundings are currently being used as a training set to develop machine learning algorithms for assisting in the editing of newly acquired data and in the recovery of previously misclassified data that were erroneously discarded. We have recently engaged in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory Stennis Space Center (NRLSSC), who are working on highly complementary machine learning applications for improving the accuracy of our seafloor prediction workflow and we plan to solidify and expand this collaboration over our next research cycle. We propose to : Improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of the global marine gravity using new satellite altimeter data collected by SARAL/Altika, CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3 and eventually SWOT. Refine machine-learning algorithms to recover sounding data that were mis-classified as erroneous. Use these improved gravity maps along with our global compilation of soundings to refine a 15-arc second bathymetry model (SRTM15+V3). Better connect the mid- and deep-ocean bathymetry with the higher resolution coastal bathymetry being compiled by other groups (e.g., GEBCO and NOAA). Work with NRL scientists to develop a machine learning algorithm to produce synthetic seafloor with appropriate roughness in areas having no soundings. Prepare the next generation of scientists for ocean research. We will coordinate our research efforts with the Naval Oceanographic Office, the Naval Research Lab, The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and make thesegrids available to Navy labs, defense contractors, and the general public.\"less",

We want to explain and predict large-scale outcomes observable in a population of intelligent agents using simple models of local interactions. Despite their simple rules of interaction, these agents must have the descriptive power of the real population, and explain large-scale observations. The model should also be prone to rigorous mathematical analysis, allowing us to make predictions. When compared with real data, the model should be able to explain how global behaviors can be triggered by events and conditions that would not be apparent in controlled, small-scale experiments. On-going work includes models of segregation and population dynamics, spreading of viral epidemics, and cooperation algorithms. Currently, our approach uses mathematical models and analysis of data from massive online social networks. Our preliminary results in this first phase of the project marked important steps towards the understanding of the collective dynamics of complex human systems and can provide relevant guidelines in a variety of strategic decision-making scenarios. These include understanding of adversarial networks triggered by segregation models, revolutionary triggers, and sustainable societal norms.less",

As with many literatures in the study of international security, research on interdependence further conflates distribution and process (who gets what versus how actors conduct the competitive process). To date, studies of the relationship between economic interdependence and conflict have focused overwhelmingly on the far-too-narrow relationship of the economic interdependencies between states. Indeed, in the late 1970s Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye advanced the concept of complex interdependence to describe the myriad of ways in which states were increasingly bound together economically. To be sure, interdependence also includes trade, but Keohane and Nye pointed out, there are several other, arguably more important, aspects of globalization. Our understanding of the effects of interdependence have been hindered by a narrow focus on trade flows. There are also reasons to believe that other aspects of interdependence (commercial, financial, monetary) are much more important to economic statecraft. To accurately characterize interdependence and understand its effects, we explore these more diverse elements.less",

Task 2: Measuring Anonymity; The goal of this task is to design methods for evaluating the amount of anonymity offered by a (possibly human-generated) process. This is easy for automatic processes, but non-trivial when humansare involved. The grantee will then perform crowdsourcing studies to determine the impact of different parameters on a crowdsourcing system that anonymizes communication. This is divided into three tasks (Tasks 3-5). Task 3: Length of text; The crowdsourcing system designed will break down text into chunks and give it to other participants toanonymize. The grantee will examine the impact of length of the text chunks on anonymization performance through pilot crowdsourcing studies. Task 4: Number of participants; The crowdsourcing system will determine the effect of the number of participants on anonymization performance through crowdsouring. Task 5: Design the reassembly process; The goal of this task is to do pilot crowdsourcing studies to figure out impact of the reassembly process. The grantee will also look at crowdsourced reassembly as a local optimization process and examine its convergence properties.Objective:In many situations, free speech is only possible under the guise of anonymity. For example, in a country like Egypt, where agents of the state may be monitoring the conversation, participants who engage in political speech may only be able to do so under anonymity. However, if writing samples from individuals are available, it is possible to determine the authorship of a piece of text from the writing style using modern stylometric methods, even when there are a large number of candidates for authorship. The objective of this project is to design algorithms and principles that will allow us to anonymize text according to writing style using crowdsourcing. These algorithms may then be used to design discussion spaces where individuals can communicate freely without fear of being recognized. Approach:The grantee will address the algorithmic aspects of the problem, and conduct small pilot studies in order to validate the proposed approaches. In particular, the grantee will (a) come up with a new principled framework for anonymity that is suitable for this problem and propose methods that enforce this kind of anonymity (b) come up with a way of evaluatingthe amount of anonymity achieved empirically and (c) analyze the anonymization process and carry out small scale crowd-sourcing studies to validate our analysis.Overall Merit and ONR Mission/Relevance:This project is directly related to ONR's mission of creating a safe and secure cyber environment, which enhances anonymity of activities in cyber-world, and ensures that eavesdroppers cannot effectively exploit cyberspace and impair its safe and secure use. Designing algorithms and principles that anonymize text by writing style will allow us to design anonymized communication fora where participants can safely speak their mind without fear of their identity being compromised by eavesdroppers and malicious adversaries.less",

Shar,ma, University of California San Diego (Senior Personnel)Computational modeling, simulation and control of physical systems characte,rized by Hamiltonian mechanics are essential for many naval applications, such as ocean flow modeling, plasma physics, and continuum, mechanics models that follow a principle of least action. Due to high model complexity, the associated transient models are high-di,mensional and nonlinear, and pro- duce massive data through numerical simulation. Efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) for the ev,olution of these high-dimensional systems are needed for long-term prediction and model- predictive control. Model reduction has bee,n successful in many compute-intensive applications. However, when these techniques are applied to Hamiltonian systems, the surrogat,e models lose their underlying physical meaning, and violate mechanical andmathematical structures. From a mathematical perspective,, Hamiltonian systems have additional physical and geometric structures in the form of symmetries, symplecticity, first integrals, an,d energy preservation. Those properties need to be preserved in time and space discretization, and particularly in data-driven reduc,ed-order modeling which is the focus of the proposed work.This project will develop a mathematically rigorous nonlinear structure-pr,eserving data-driven reduced-order modeling (SP-DDROM) strategy for Hamiltonian systems. This will produce computationally efficient, structure-preserving ROMs through learning from high-dimensional data. First, we will develop a new structure-preserving operator l,earning framework for Hamiltonian systems that also applies to noncanonical structures. Second, we will derive certifications for ac,- curacy, mechanical and mathematical properties of the obtained ROMs. Third, we will develop a transfer learning method for data-dr,iven ROMs that addresses the need to update ROM basis functions for convective and highly transient systems. Fourth, we will develop, and test these ROMs on a variety of applications with naval relevance. For example, ocean simulation models can be formulated as a,Hamiltonian system, and since they often have to be simulated for decades to centuries of real time, ROMs play a crucial role in eff,iciently making long-term predictions.Approved for public releaseless",

The complex IoT ecosystem and the abundance of interfaces via multiple small devices renders it vulnerable to\" a host of nefarious security and privacy attacks: the edge devices sense the physical entities, accumulate private data, or activat\"e/control tangible equipment with the potential of causing damages to the real-world. The available methodologies for conventional cloud security do not scale well tothe edge devices.Intellectual Merits: This proposal suggests a multi-pronged approach to compre\"hensively address the IoT security vulnerabilities. More specifically, the proposal is focused on three separate but interrelated th\"rusts. The first thrust is centered on security primitives that are rooted in the physical nature of the IoTs. These primitives prov\"ide a solid basis for securing small devices (e.g., key generation, transient key exchange, and fast authentication) by attesting to\"\" thechip physical properties, as well as leveraging the properties of the communication and sensing channels. The second thrust is\" centered on secure and private gathering of data and matching of content on the distributed nodes. More specifically we research multi-party secure computations of various complexity and privacy guarantees. The third thrust is concerned with performing more sophisticated data analytics on distributed devices such as nearest neighbor searchand machine learning. The physical nature of the netw\"ork extends the vulnerabilities to the physical world suggesting threats to human lives, transportation systems, and other critical\" infrastructure. The stringent performance and security requirements of IoTsmakes them an immediate example of a physical-digital e\"cosystems where innovations are critical to keep pace with the growing amounts of complex data, real-time monitoring of the space. W\"\"e shall provide methods for authenticating data, software, and firmware on the devices and among the transiently communicating devic\"\"es, as well as secure and private gathering and analysis of data. In particular, we consider methodologies that have the potential t\"\"o scale tolarger IoTs. Broader Impact: The results of this project will enable effective, scalable, practical and fundamental solut\"ions for design and optimization of secure IoTs that directly translate to stronger cryptography and security for a myriads of modern tasks with sensitive data on constrained devices. The project has wide reaching applications from military to civilian usage. They\" include secure processing of medical, sensor, and monitoring data, as well as personal, industrial, government, and military cloud\" computing/data analytics. The research program is interdisciplinary and integratesknowledge not only across the fields of hardware design and security but also from optimization and machine learning. The resulting software tools andhardware modules will contribute to a lively and interactive education in security and will be relevant to a broad set of developers outside academia who design secure algorithms and applications. The PI plans to embark on an ambitious educational program that targets both undergraduate/ gra\"duate students, and also addresses issues related to outreach.

It represents a major source of uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery and is only crudely parameterized in Naval operational models. Our group has spent over a decade re ning the wave-powered Wirewalker pro ling system in order to investigate these small-scale, rapidly evolving upper ocean processes. The Wirewalker has been successfully utilized in a number of recent DRIs. At present, thedeployment endurance of the Wirewalker system is limited by onboard battery capacity.

The propo\"sed system will use ocean wavesfor vertical vehicle propulsion and to produce electrical power for onboard instrumentation, allowing prolonged collection and telemetry of data at high sampling rates. Livewire2 would represent a major stepforward in environmental monitoring of the ocean, with broad applicability to current and future Naval needs. The prolonged deployments it will a ord can bridge the sampling space between high frequency ocean variability (e.g. diurnal cycling) and sub-seasonal to seasonal variability (e.\"g. the Madden-JulianOscillation).

For greatest mobility and agility, these need to operate at extremely low size, weight and power (SWAP). This calls for a concerted effort in the fabrication and characterization of custom reconfigurable large-scale neuromorphic hardware at extreme efficiency and density. This acquisition and procurement of infrastructure equipment facilities and microfabrication in the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program is in support of research being conducted as part of the Office of Naval Research Science of Artificial Intelligence Program towards large-scale spike-based neuromorphic systems with persistent online deep learning. To attain record levels in high-density, low-energy operation of massively parallel neuromorphic hardware developed in this research, we target custom fabrication and experimental characterization of vertically integrated complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) neuron arrays and emerging technology memristive crossbar synapse arrays. Specifically this DURIP will provide the following instrumentationresources to this research: 1) a low-noise, precisely temperature controlled probe station for acquiring and analyzing current-voltage characteristics across very large crossbar arrays of memristive elements such as the resistive random-access memory (RRAM) adaptable synapses under development; and 2) custom high-density hybridized integration of RRAM synapse arrays at 380nm pitch on top of CMOS wafers in 22nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology. The combination of these two will provide a one-of-its-kind experimental platform, at unprecedented high density and high accuracy, in evaluating compute-in-memory architectures for neuromorphic adaptive AI onthe edge in current and future ONR programs.less",

        "abstract": "The exchange of tracer (temperature, salinity, contaminants, pathogens, sediment, nutrients, or larvae) between distinct nearshore geographical and dynamic regimes such as a tidal inlet and the ocean or the surfzone and the inner-shelf is poorly understood. For example, the tidal forcing dominates within the inlet whereas just outside the inlet wind, wave, buoyancy, and rotation processes become more important. Similarly, breaking-wave driven surfzone processes are radically different from the wind, buoyancy, and rotation driven processes in the inner-shelf. The interface of these regimes is important to Navy operations, yet neglect of the dynamical difference across these regions, particularly stratification, can lead to significant errors in quantifying the magnitude and mechanisms of exchange. I led two recent dye tracer release experiments: a surfzone/inner-shelf experiment (IB09, Fall 2009, Imperial Beach CA) and a tidal-inlet/surfzone/inner-shelf experiment (RIVET-I, Spring 2012, New River Inlet NC). Both IB09 and RIVET experiments had significant dye, temperature, wave, and current observations, spanning remote-sensed and in situ, for comparison against models. Each experiment provides different insight into nearshore exchange processes. Stratification plays a major role in the exchange across dynamical boundaries such as inlet/ ocean or surfzone/inner-shelf. Building upon our current analyses, the extensive surfzone/innershelf IB09 and inlet/ocean RIVET-I observations will be used in conjunction with coupled numerical models to improve our understanding of exchange across these distinct dynamical regions. This will be performed by combining remote-sensed observations, in situ observations, and simulations of tracer exchange, using coupled models (funwaveC/ROMS/SWAN) that include all the potentially relevant physics. In particular, we will 1. Perform coupled model simulations of surfzone and stratified inner-shelf temperature and dye from the IB09 field experiment. Subsequent model-data comparison and analysis will allow for new understanding regarding the mechanisms (rip currents, internal waves, Stokesdrift exchange), length-scales, and time-scales of tracer and stratification evolution onto the inner-shelf. 2. Perform model-data comparison & analysis for inlet dye releases with negligible wind and waves but strong stratification. This will lead to insight into how does material dispersion occurs between a tidal inlet and a stratified open ocean. This will push the existing model parameterization for vertical and lateral mixing to its limits, something which has not been tested before, and lead to insights regarding lateral and vertical tracer dispersal. The result of this new modeling of existing field observations and analysis will provide an improved understanding of the exchange across these distinct dynamical regions.less",

        "abstract": "Understanding the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment lies at the forefront of understanding water quality. Interfacial chemistry between water and soil plays an important role in the transformation of contaminants in the environment. However, it is well known that this chemistry can be complex, as these transformations depend on a number of factors. Limiting our understanding of these transformations are the tools needed to investigate these complex environmental systems. Motivated by this lack of knowledge, this research focuses on purchasing and utilizing a relatively new technique to investigate the nature of soil surfaces and other materials relevant to the Army Research Office and the Department of Defense. In particular, micro-spectroscopic techniques, such as optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy coupled to Raman spectroscopy, has been developed to provide high spatial resolution that are beyond the limits of conventional techniques. The instrument called a \u00d2mIRage+Raman\u00d3 is able to achieve submicron spatial resolution, as low as 0.5 micron, which allows for the mapping of chemicals in complex environmental systems to gain information about the nature of coatings found on soil surfaces in the environment. This will allow for the better understanding of how these surfaces interact with chemical contaminants. Currently the instrument has been mainly limited in its application to life sciences and polymer research. The goal of the proposed plan is to further develop this instrument into studying the multiple phases and chemicals that are simultaneously present in environmental systems. By taking advantage of the high spatial resolution chemical mapping capabilities of the mIRage+Raman instrument, we will be able to bridge the chemical data from the spectral analysis and the physical data from the optical images to clearly investigate environmental interfaces that play a role in contaminant transformation. Furthermore, this instrument allows for the study of environmental films that contain soft materials such as biological components and organic matter. The instrument also allows for rough samples to be analyzed and can be used to investigate in detail the heterogeneity of the sample. Thus, the mIRage-Raman instrument will provide a wide range of valuable information about the heterogeneous nature of complex environment samples. These include geochemical (soil) interfaces, urban films, surface films in indoor environments and new materials currently being developed for chemical warfare agent decontamination, thereby opening up its potential in environmental research focused on remediation and decontamination. This research aligns well with the ARO Environmental Chemistry Program as the development of new tools and techniques is key to studying environmental complexity to better understand chemical fate and transport as well as environmental forensics. Since the interfacial region is of most importance, this technique can play an important role in determining the spatial heterogeneity and molecular species on these interfaces. The instrument can also be applied to other areas of interest to the DoD including the development of new materials for decontamination.less",

        "abstract": "This DURIP proposal is submitted to the ONR (Dr. Deborah Van Vechten, Email: deborah.vanvechten@navy.mil), in request of funding to acquire a cryogenic probe station and testing apparatus for research in high-bandwidth, low-energy, electro-optic modulators and sw itches.Recently, moderately low drive voltage (1 - 4 volts) electro-optic modulators (EOMs) with about 100 GHz bandwidth (true elec tro-optic RF bandwidth) have been developed and demonstrated using thin-film electro-optic materials. Such EOMs exceed the bandwidth that can be achieved using silicon photonic or III-V photonic modulators, and also offer realization of true phase modulation as we ll as high extinction ratio amplitude modulation through linearized Mach- Zehnder device structures. However, a different class of o ptimized EOM designs can offer maximum instantaneous bandwidths exceeding 0.5 THz and driving voltages as small as a few millivolts. The realization of THz-class bandwidths and ultralow driving voltages in EOMs could be helpful for amplifier-free readout of single flux quantum signals, or to fully exploit the timing resolution supported by certain single-photon detectors where the timing jitte r can now be lessthan 3 ps full-width at half-maximum.Although modern designs and fabrication methods allow additional degrees of freedom which permit precise index matching and impedance definition, the RF loss of the transmission line prevents the EOM perform ance from reaching its fundamental limits under normal conditions. In fact, in devices where performance is governed by RF loss, it is not possible to fully trade off excess bandwidth for lower voltage. We propose that, by modifying and optimizing the design for cryogenic operation, EOMs with long transmission lines can be designed and optimized to achieve ultralow drive voltages while also achieving ultrahigh bandwidth and high extinction ratio. Such traveling-wave EOMs would be relatively unimpacted by the significant stabilization constraints, as well as the linearity and dynamic range limitations of resonant (e.g., microring) EOMs. When brought together, ultrahigh bandwidth, low-voltage EOMs and high photon-efficiency, low-jitter single photon detectors will allow mm-wave s ignal processing and interconnects at the physical limits of detectivity, and this capability, if successfully realized in real devi ces, can enable a wide range of applications relevant to the DoD in communications, sensors, LIDAR, tomography, phased arrays, metro logy, test and measurement, spectrum surveillance and position, and navigation and timing (PNT) applications. Thus, in this DURIP pr oposal, we seek to acquire instrumentation that can be used for research in cryogenic ultra-high bandwidth electro-optic modulator a nd switch devices.less",

        "abstract": "Navy-supported monitoring and research efforts aim to characterize the vocalizations of marine mammal species present in operating areas (OPAREAS), determine their seasonal presence, and evaluate the potential for impact from naval training. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an effective means for monitoring mammal populations and acoustic conditions at the spatial and temporal scales dictated by naval training activities. High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARPs), and their precursers known as Acoustic Recording Packages (ARPs) have been used for autonomous monitoring and research of marine mammal populations on Navy ranges for over 20 years. Since its inception, iterative technical research and development have continuously advanced HARP technology to keep it in stride with industry technological advances in hardware, data storage, power consumption, and signal processing techniques. HARPs are currently unmatched in their ability to autonomously record and archive high-quality, continuous, calibrated, broadband (10 Hz - 160 kHz) passive acoustic data for over a year at a time between service intervals. The Marine Physical Laboratory (MPL) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography currently maintains a fleet of 25 HARPs used for Navy projects. A purchase of hardware to upgrade this fleet of instruments with a low-power mass data storage module based on Secure Digital (SD) memory cards is proposed. This upgrage will reduce HARP power consumption by one-half, greatly-reducing battery costs, which currently make up approximately 50% of standard annual HARP refurbishign expenses. In addition, the low-power upgrade will simplify instruments to improve reliability, support higher lossless data compression and enable higher sampling rates over long periods. The reduced power requirements allow the standard HARP data-logging electronics and battery configuration for a full-bandwidth, 1 year deployment to be fully-contained within a single pressure case where previously two were required. The resulting HARP with SD card data storage mooring is small enough to be deployed and recovered from a small boat hand-over-hand without any reduction in recording performance (sample rate, recording quality, and recording duration). By reducing battery costs, field expenses, and hardware needs, this enhancement is expected to pay for itself many times over through future funding long-term PAM recording cost savings.less",

Impact from this source can range from behavioral and physiological response to lethal strandings and potentially result in population level consequences of disturbance. Comprehensive US Navy funded studies are underway in multiple ocean regions, to better understand the short and long-term impacts of this anthropogenic disturbance on these species, witha particular focus on Cuvier#s beaked whale population trends. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), equipped with high resolution cameras and precision altitude measurement devices, are a relatively inexpensive, yet highly capable platform for collecting critical data from marine mammals. During at-sea surveys, portable scientific echosounders provide insights into available prey fields and henceunderlying ecological conditions for the observed marine mammals. With the use of UAS, we have been successful in collecting photo identification and behavioral data as well as precise body measurements (morphometrics), which can provide insights into age and sexclassification, individual health, growth rates, and pregnancy status. Recent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 848, requires UAS systems manufactured in China to be replaced with US built systems which we propose here. Additionally, UAS systems are frequently used in conjunction with other sampling methodologies, such as on-animal tags, to record whale diving and foraging behavior, or scientific echosounders, to record prey fields. We propose to procure a portable scientific echosounder system available to our team for field efforts, enabling us to match surface to midwater prey fields, to those recorded in deep water by existing moored systems. As an immediate use case, this will allow for direct comparisons between a Cuvier#s beaked whale population inhabiting the US Navy sonar training range off Southern California, with populations in two MFAS undisturbed areas, off the coast of Guadalupe Island, Mexico and Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal.This abstract is publicly releasable.less",

The system is equipped withlow noise and high frequency probes to support cryogenic wafer-scaled testing, thus greatlyincreasing the efficiency of experiment and reducing the parasitic effects due to packaging. Thelatter is particularly important for investigation of the intrinsic gain-bandwidth product and noiseproperties of the CEP devices. The system also provides a clear optical window and easy lightaccess to the device under test, facilitating the measurements of quantum efficiency,photoresponsivity, material absorption coefficient, light emission efficiency and spectroscopicstudies.Devices using the CEP effect show highly promising properties, including high amplificationfactor under low bias, intrinsic stability, and ultralow noise. These unique properties areparticularly attractive to many DoD applications such as sensing, imaging, and communications.The preliminary experimental results and theoretical analyses have indicated that the CEP effectis likely a phonon mediated process. One of the most unique characteristics is that phonon mayplay a positive role in the device~s low noise and inherent stability, which is in sharp contrast withthe usually negative roles phonons play in all other semiconductor devices. Using the proposedsystem, we will be able to conduct accurate measurements under different temperatures andmagnetic fields (the CEP effect is predicted to be spin dependent too) to develop a more completephysical model for this new phenomenon. A correct and thorough understanding of the CEP effectwill enable many device applications of DoD interest.less",

Profiling float and glider T/S profiles will be utilized, and can be augmented with oxygen profiles where available. While analysis here can be stand-alone, collaboration with NASCar modeling and in situ microstructure will enhance the impact and usability of the results. (a) The western Indian Ocean tropics, with strongly ?-dominated zonal PV distribution, are dynamically separated from the northern Arabian Sea with its more homogenized PV distribution (McCarthy and Talley, 1999). It is hypothesized here that this must impact Rossby wave propagation and spinup of the Somali Current, and the reversing monsoon currents in the tropics and northern Arabian Sea. Novelty: connection of well-known dynamical regimes with PV distribution, which may provide new physical understanding of Somali Current seasonality. Method: PV/T/S/velocity, and oxygen where available, will be mapped from basin-wide profiling floats, surface drifters, altimetry, including data assimilation, permitting analysis of the propagation of planetary waves relative to the mapped underlying PV structure. Close collaboration with NASCar modeling is expected. (b) Vertical mixing of heat, salt, and momentum, central to upper ocean stratification, are affected by diapycnal diffusivity ?, which can be estimated from T/S finestructure. ? just below the mixed layer has been shown recently to be related to wind strength, tides/bottom roughness, eddy kinetic energy, and latitude. In the Arabian Sea, ? is higher in the west (boundary currents) and in the tropics, and is very low in the east. Because ? has a large range in the Arabian Sea, mechanisms that result in this range can be evaluated. An additional factor in vertical mixing in the A.S. is the destabilizing salinity stratification, which affects mixing, air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes, and SST gradient; the associated air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes affect the monsoon winds. A.S. stratification is subject to both double diffusion (warm salty over cold fresh) and barrier layers (warm fresh over warm salty), depending on region and season. Unaligned salinity/temperature fronts can create localized subduction. Novelty: relate A.S. diapycnal diffusivity variability and salinity stratification to monsoonal winds, seasonal stratification, Somali Current variability (Great Whirl, Socotra Gyre, etc) and Rossby wave activity, bottom roughness/tides, latitude. Double diffusive processes will also be evaluated. Method: calculate finestructure diffusivity below the mixed layer as a function of time and space, and relative to salinity stratification, and compare with in situ microstructure measurements, both to provide improved distribution for modeling. Close collaboration with NASCar microstructure observations and modelers is expected.less",

Of particular importance is the unambiguous detection of a novel class of robust electronic states in topological materials, which could be harnessed in devices to enable new forms of quantum information processing. Due to small energy scales that characterize these fragile states, low temperatures are required for their detection in the lab. To address this challenge, the proposed instrumentation will enable electronic characterization of quantum materials at ultra-low temperatures in the milliKelvin regime. The proposed equipment consists of a dilution refrigerator with two key features- (1) a rotating sample holder that enables measurements in tilted magnetic fields, thereby controlling the transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, and (2) a fast sample exchange feature that facilitates high-throughput sample characterization in order to accelerate the pace of research. By interfacing the dilution refrigerator with existing cryogenic infrastructure, the proposed setup will minimize costly helium consumption and expand the range of operation of existing facilities down to ultra-low temperatures. As a shared-use asset among multiple investigators, this setup will support active research currently funded by AFOSR, ARO, and DARPA and enhance research-related education for a cohort of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.less",

The inner shelf is a region in which a variety of processes can occur across- and along-shelf over times scales from seconds to seasons, and length scales from meters to tens of kilometers or more. Covering these processes of Naval interest in areas that may be inaccessible or denied requires novel methods of measurement. In this project, surface and internal wave processes will be measured over large areas in relatively short times using the Modular Aerial Sensing System (MASS), which includes a scanning lidar, and infrared, hyperspectral and visible imagers on a manned aircraft. The MASS will permit us to measure surface wave processes in great detail and the surface signatures of internal waves that can shoal, break and mix the water column in the inner shelf. Imagery from the MASS can measure surface currents, and an airborne bathymetric lidar will be used to measure the water depth. The option of measuring the details of the lower marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and the water column are addressed by two instrumented autonomous surface vehicles (Wave Gliders) that include wirewalker CTDs for profiling the water column. The techniques developed and used in the proposed research can be readily transitioned to a combined autonomous airborne and surface vehicle system.less",

Specifically, they will utilize a multi-scale modeling approach to iteratively and bi-directionally integrate an agent-based single cell level model with a coarse grained continuous population-level model, which will allow to efficiently bridge the gap between single cell and population behavior. The coarse-grained description will be based on deterministic partial differential equations that will allow us to efficiently model population-level dynamics as a function of space and time. The construction of these models will be constrained by quantitative experimental data obtained for the locally-averaged gene expression in individual cells and cell-cell communication signals. In parallel, UCSD will also construct an agent-based discrete models to directly model stochastic single-cell dynamics. Such models will also account for mechanical interactions among cells within the microbial communities. Each cell in the population will be modeled as a spherocylinder that can grow along its axis and divide once the conditions for division are met (e.g. cell size or time since last division exceeding certain pre-defined thresholds). Simultaneously, they will model intracellular biochemical reactions within each cell stochastically using Gillespie algorithm [70]. These two subsystems will be coupled because the growth conditions for cells will depend on the concentrations of proteins in each cell. The parameters of discrete and continuum models will have to be matched in orderorder for the two models to cooperate and exchange the information.

These waves have three important properties that may enable significant advances for next-generation, high-performance, reconfigurable THz or optical communication and sensing systems, such as illustrated in figure 1. 1. Line waves contain a field singularity at the boundary, actually going to infinity in the mathematical limit of a thin surface. Even in practical implementations which are limited by the surface properties, they provide very high field concentration which is potentially useful for nonlinear effects such as modulators or amplifiers. 2. Line waveguides are topological photonic insulators, so they have very low reflection even from hard boundaries, which may be useful for isolators, circulators, or other devices that require breaking time-reversal symmetry. 3. They are defined only by the impedance of the surrounding surfaces, which can be tuned using a variety of techniques in graphene, semiconductor, or liquid crystal based platforms. This means that they can form field-programmable transmission lines which can be used to build complex reconfigurable photonic or THz systems. Line waveguides are also inherently broadband, with experimental prototypes exhibiting four octaves of bandwidth at microwave frequencies. They can be implemented on a variety of substrates and surfaces, which provides a wide range of options for electronic reconfiguration in a variety of regimes including optical or THz frequencies. They are open structures, so fields can interact with external electrons to create vacuum electronic devices. They can also be implemented on electronic topological insulators, and the line waves can be coupled to topological electronic edge states to create nonreciprocal devices.less",

It has become apparent that simple diffusion models of the OBL based only on wind forcing cannot account for the role surface waves play in the air-sea fluxes and in the dynamics of both the ocean boundary layer and the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) above. This is the focus of the \u201cWaves, Langmuir Cells, and the Upper Ocean Boundary Layer\u201d DRI. As part of the project, PI Melville has been funded through N00014-14-1-0710 to conduct measurements of the surface ocean and lower atmosphere (SOLA) from R/P FLIP, an aircraft, and two unmanned surface vehicles (Wave Glider USVs: WGs). In SoCal2013 the modular aerial sensing system (MASS), which includes a scanning lidar for surface wave measurement, and visible, infrared (IR) and hyperspectral imagery for surface signatures of wave breaking and Langmuir turbulence (LT), was flown on the aircraft. The WGs were equipped with SOLA instrument packages to measure lower MABL fields and fluxes, and upper ocean current, turbulence and temperature fields. Despite the success of these measurements in SoCal2013 there is room for improvement and that is the motivation for this DURIP proposal which includes funding for two fabrications: 1. Installation and testing of a higher resolution IR camera on the MASS system for improved resolution of the surface signatures and horizontal resolution of Langmuir turbulence. 2. Installation and testing of a five-beam acoustic Doppler current profiler (AD2CP) on each of the two WGs for improved measurement of vertical velocity in the upper 7m of the water column.less",

        "abstract": "Ensuring security and safety of next generation artificial intelligence (AI) models is a standing challenge. This proposal suggests a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safety of the emerging DL models and protecting them against attacks. Two open questions regarding the adversarial attacks on DL are investigated: (i) Why are deep learning models vulnerable to adversarial samples? and (ii) How can we characterize and thwart the underlying space to provide unsupervised model assurance as well as defense against the adversaries? We build upon our recent exciting preliminary results in which we have a series of density estimators to identify the \u00d4adversarial subspaces\u00d5. Intellectual Merit: Our hypothesis is that the vulnerability of DL models to adversarial samples is due to the rarely explored sub-spaces in each feature map. In particular, the rare subspaces are caused by the limited availability of labeled data and/or inefficiency of regularization algorithms. Several earlier works suggested supervised training of the original model with the added adversarial samples. However, learning the multi-dimensional space of the potential adversaries with limited data has at least three challenges. One, there are several rarely sampled unexplored sub-spaces, and modeling such a complex space may not impractical. Two, the bounded data available may create additional rarely explored sub- spaces. Three, the robustness-accuracy trade-off will lead to lowering the performance of the original model. Instead, our novel methodology performs unsupervised characterization of explored sub-spaces based on the training data. To maintain accuracy, we suggest a new defense based on Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) which keeps the victim model intact, and trains separate defender modules. The proposal simultaneously advances the state-of-the-art in theory and practice of adversarial DL. Broader Impact: This project will enable effective, scalable, practical and fundamental solutions for design and optimization of Safe Deep Learning models that directly translate to protection of a myriads of modern sensitive tasks that rely on DL. The research program is interdisciplinary and integrates knowledge not only across the fields of machine learning and security but also optimization and hardware implementation. The resulting SW and HW tools will contribute to a lively and interactive education in machine learning and security and will be relevant to a broad set of developers outside academia. The PIs have a track record for mentoring women and continue to play a major role in engaging graduate women in ECE as well as outreaching to younger generations of women and minority students. It is understood that any developmental items and specially designed parts, components, accessories and attachments fabricated under any Department of Defense award resulting from this proposal are being developed for both civil and military applications.less",

The objective of the proposed work is to develop a modular system for measuring both shear and temperature microstructure, as well as other quantities such as microconductivity, in an inexpensive, low-power package capable of telemetering data back to shore. The system will be easily deployable on moored profilers, gliders, wire walkers, floats and other autonomous vehicles, greatly increasing the number and ease of turbulence observations and significantly expanding our ability to 1) field extensive 3-D arrays of profiling moorings and 2) contribute to autonomous experiments such as the Flow Encountering Abrupt Topography (FLEAT) and Northern Arabian Sea Circulation autonomous research (NASCar) programs, for the study of a variety of complex ocean processes including internal waves, submesoscale flows and turbulence. Better understanding and measurement of these processes is vital for improving the fidelity of regional and climate models and better prediction of ocean state. The PIs on this proposal supervise graduate students, and it is expected that this technology will form a significant component of a number of Ph.D. projects and significantly enhance their ability to conduct meaningful research.less",

        "abstract": "A swept-frequency acoustic source developed by Teledyne Webb Research (TWR) has become the workhorse in a series of ONR-funded experiments to study low-frequency, deep-water ocean acoustic propagation. A FY2017 DURIP proposal entitled \"\"Low-Frequency Acoustic Sources for Ocean Acoustic Propagation Experiments~ requested $467,400 to upgrade six existing TWRacoustic sources belonging to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The FY2017 proposal was partially funded for $233,700 (50%). With this funding, TWR will be able to do the required research, development, and non-recurring engineering needed to upgrade the sources and to upgrade and test one source as a prototype. A second increment of $285,381 is requested in this proposal in order to complete the upgrade of the remaining five sources. The proposedincrement is greater than the funding awarded in FY 2017 mostly because it is somewhat inefficient to do the work in two stages, although a two-stage effort will actually maximize the probability of success of the source upgrade. As noted in the FY2017 proposal, the oldest sources owned by SIO are well over a decade old, and even the youngest is over six years old. The source electronics, including the power amplifier and transducer matching circuitry, are nowobsolete. It is no longer possible to maintain the existing electronics, as many of the critical components are not available. The upgrade will include replacing the electronics and, where necessary, the actuators that move the sleeves used to tune the resonator frequency, with modern versions. The upgrades will expand the capabilities of the sources and extend their lives for use in future ONR-funded experiments. The upgrades will provide the ability to program morecomplex frequency-modulated signals (e.g., up-down and/or non-linear FM sweeps) and to control the signal amplitude. The new electronics will also have the ability to transmit narrowband signals with arbitrary waveforms with the tunable resonator in a fixed position. We anticipate that data obtained in future ONR-funded ocean acoustic experiments using the upgraded TWR sources will contribute to the education and research of graduate students andpost-graduate researchers.less",

It represents a major source of uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery and is only crudely parameterized in Naval operational models. Our group has spent over a decade re ning the wave-powered Wirewalker pro ling system in order to investigate these small-scale, rapidly evolving upper ocean processes. The Wirewalker has been successfully utilized in a number of recent DRIs. At present, the deployment endurance of the Wirewalker system is limited by onboard battery capacity. Here we propose to leverage the Wirewalker platform and the previous DURIP-supported development of a free- ooding generator to produce the Livewire2\" pro ling system. The proposed system will use ocean waves for vertical vehicle propulsion and to produce electrical power for onboard instrumentation, allowing prolonged collection and telemetry of data at high sampling rates. Livewire2 would represent a major step forward in environmental monitoring of the ocean, with broad applicability to current and future Naval needs. The prolonged deployments it will a ord can bridge the sampling space between high frequency ocean variability (e.g. diurnal cycling) and sub-seasonal to seasonal variability (e.g. the Madden-Julian Oscillation). Additionally, as this proposal will produce a DRI-ready\" version of Livewire2, data gathered by the system will form a signi cant component of Ph.D. projects for current and future students, including the incoming student supported by Lucas' recent ONR YIP award.less",

To successfully quantify behavioral responses to MFAS and potential short- and long-term impacts, it is essential to understand the behavior of individuals under natural as well as disturbedcircumstances. The aim of this proposed work is to investigate the fine-scale dive behavior of Cuvier#s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) as well as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) in relation to measured prey distributions and environmental variables at a highly sonar-impacted and a minimally disturbed site. Marine mammals inhabit a highly dynamic, mobile environment. Unlike terrestrial or benthic habitats, pelagic habitats are influenced by fluid dynamical features that change positionand structure over time. This presents a challenge for management and conservation. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) Local physical oceanographic conditions drive small-scale epi-, meso-, and bathypelagic prey distributions. (2) Marine mammals # with a focus on blue, fin, and Cuvier#s beaked whales # sense and target dense aggregations of prey and adapt their foraging behavior to changing prey conditions. (3) Use of MFAS during US Navy training operations will invoke a behavioral response, in the form of quantifiable change in marine mammal acoustic and dive behavior. (4) The behavioral response will be dependent on the underlying prey conditions and the current behavioral state of the individual.Data collection occurred with multi-channel passive acoustic recorders at asonar-impacted and a minimally disturbed site. These will be analyzed to identify tracks of calling blue and fin whales and track fine-scale dive behavior of Cuvier#s beaked whales during foraging. Information on pelagic prey was collected with autonomous active-acoustic systems. Physical oceanographic features were measured with autonomous conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and oxygen sensors. Blue, fin and Cuvier#s beaked whale tracks will be computed across a 2-year data set based on their B, D, 20 Hz and 40 Hz calls, and echolocation clicks, respectively. MFAS occurrence will be documented. Active acoustic backscatter strength of taxonomic groups will be integrated across relevant depth bins. Physical oceanographic properties will be computed across those depth bins. A statistical framework will be developed to test relationships.Dynamic ecosystem-based management and impact mitigation requires a holistic view of the pelagic ecosystem, with an understanding of not only organismal behavior but also of the underlying physics. This workwill provide insight into the physical drivers of nekton distribution from surface waters to the bathypelagic and the subsequent marine mammal response at a sonar-impacted and minimally disturbed site in comparison.less",

The goal of this effort is to reduce the environmental impact associated with drifter deployments, by drastically reducing the amount of petroleum-based plastic of the drifters The design of these new drifters will be identical to the one developed by the Lagrangian Drifter Laboratory (LDL), under the direction Dr. Peter Niiler and Dr. Luca Centurioni at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and Mr. Lancelot Braasch. The LDL SVP drifter design has been extensively tested in the field, with an excess of 2,000 drifters produced and deployed worldwide in the past five years to maintain the Global Drifter Program Array and in support of several ONR experiments. The ecological friendly drifters fabricated with this effort will be deployed in support of several ONR Departmental Research Initiatives such as CALYPSO, NISKINe and MISO-BoB. The drifters will be fabricated at the LDL. The materials selected to be used in the SVP-BIO typically cost anywhere from 50% to 400% more than their petroleum-based equivalent found on the standard SVP and SVP-B drifters, but due to the trace amounts used per platform and total volume per year, these price increases only raise the drifter~s bill of materials by roughly 20% overall.

The conversion of ocean wave energy to a mechanical power suitable for electrical generation is nontrivial, with a long history of challenges resulting from the rigor of designing and maintaining equipment in the ocean environment. One technical challenge central to any wave energy conversion devices is the wide range of ocean sea state conditions; typically characterized by a directional wave spectrum. Simply put, many systems are designed for narrow band spectra and are challenged by the broad bandwidth of ocean wavelengths and the variation of energy within the different bands. As wave energy conversion designs mature, scale model assessments will be required in large wave basins as part of the technical design process. This proposal outlines an effort to support these efforts through assessing available full-scale ocean wave spectra, and comparing with data generated from large scale wave basins. The resulting research will provide a better foundation for laboratory testing ocean wave energy conversion systems.less",

The overarching goal of this proposed one-year ONR project is to develop and establish the technological fo,undations of an integrated, wearable, health and safety monitoring platform specifically for shipboard sailors. The integrated monit,oring platform consists of two primary systems. The first component is an elastic chest band with integrated nanocomposite sensors a,nd a low-profile wireless sensing node for monitoring sailor respiration and physical activity. Measurements of respiration and phys,ical activity of sailors onboard ships, especially during emergency response situations, can potentially reveal their neurophysiolog,ical condition and health. The second component is a metamaterial, passive,antenna tag that will change its antenna characteristics,in response to sailor environment. The metamaterials will be designed to change their physical, and thus antenna electromagnetic cha,racteristics, in response to seawater to enable the detection of sailors working or trapped in flooded ship compartments. Overall, t,his project will address the engineering challenges associated with designing and fabricating these on-body sensing systems. The tec,hnology will be primed for design optimization and extensive laboratory and human participant testing in the near future.

        "abstract": "Rationale. Submesoscale activity (with scales <1 day and <10 km) is enhanced where horizontalgradients are strong on the peripheries of mesoscale fronts and eddies (with scales of severaldays and 100 km). Vertical velocity (w) is of order 10 m day~1 and transports properties acrossthe mixed layer base. However, w is challenging to observe amidst an ambient internal wavefieldwith w variability of order 1 cm s~1. Therefore, high spatial and temporal resolution near the frontare needed to understand the 3D flow connecting the surface ocean to the interior.Goals. This DURIP award will add 10 SOLO-II profiling floats equipped with Conductivity-Temperature-Depth instruments (CTD) and chlorophyll (chl) fluorometers to an existing array of8 floats for the Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Surface Ocean to Interior (CALYPSO)Departmental Research Initiative. Repeated rapidly-profiling float array deployments and shipbasedsurveys will measure the 3D circulation (w in particular) at a front across a range of scales: at mesoscale by assimilating the float array and ship survey data in a multiscale, numericalmodel and by using a simple diagnostic, quasigeostrophic dynamical model; in submesoscale streamers by tracking tracers, such as salinity (S), spice (T variability alongisopycnals), chl, and potential vorticity; and due to high-frequency internal waves, low-frequency internal tides, and near-inertial internalwaves from each float~s w and density oscillations.Plan. Repeated meso- and submesoscale-resolving surveys with an Underway CTD (UCTD)will follow an array of 18 SOLO-II floats at a mesoscale front between Atlantic and Mediterraneanwaters. A mesoscale UCTD survey and satellite temperature will identify the front. The float arraywill be deployed in a box pattern at a submesoscale streamer along the front. Each float obtainsT, S, and chl fluorescence profiles to 200 m every 100 minutes, which is about 400 profiles over a30-day cruise. A finer resolution submesoscale UCTD survey will follow the float array at the frontwith cross-front sections of 20 km completed every 6 hours with T and S profiles every 4 minutesor 250 m in the horizontal. Once the array strains too much in the alongfront direction and losescross-front coverage, the whole suite of observations will be relocated and repeated every 1~2 days.Anticipated results. To better resolve intense, localized downwelling through the boundarylayer into the interior at the front targeted for CALYPSO, this project will increase the array from8 to 18 rapidly-profiling SOLO-II floats. Repeated deployments of the float array will: (a) measurew directly and by tracking tracers, (b) gather dense hydrographic data to resolve 3D submesoscaleprocesses, (c) aid local prediction via data assimilation, and (d) identify the process(es) producingw, which is enhanced at submesoscales on the edges of fronts and eddies. Graduate students willparticipate in multi-facteted research cruises, learn UCTD survey techniques, and use autonomousinstrumentation. The data from the float array and UCTD will be made available to a future graduatestudent as a component of a PhD program.less",

Our analysis will focus on observations collected during the Flows Encountering Abrupt Topography (FLEAT) experiment at the island of Palau. To date, we have examined how deep-ocean inertial motions are altered by the presence of Palau, leading to flow intensifications, vorticity generation, and inertial wakes. We have also considered geostrophic flow accelerations through island gaps and over ridge features, leading to form drag and eddy generation, as well as the spatial and temporal variability of tidal flows around Palau. In this three-year study, we will examine the extent to which near-inertial internal waves are generated due to surface layer inertial motions interacting with Palau using the MITgcm and moored observations. We hypothesize that the generation of downward propagating near-inertial waves may contribute to the layered flow structure frequently observed in moored and shipboard observations at Palau. We will compare and contrast the conversion of surface layer near-inertial currents to near-inertial internal waves, to the conversion of barotropic to baroclinic tidal motions. Preliminary results suggest that semidiurnal and diurnal internal tides are generated at Palau; however, additional work is needed to understand the contributions of remotely generated internal tides that impinge on Palau from sources to the west. These studies will lead to a better understanding of the predictability of these prominent sources of oceanic variability near Palau, and more generally at island and ridge topographies, which are common features in the western tropical Pacific and elsewhere.less",

The CEP detector research is currently supported by the Office of Naval Research under Dr. Kevin Leonard.The proposed system will have the capabilities of measuring the quantum efficiency, gain, speed, sensitivity, detectivity, frequency dependent noise characteristics of CEP detectors designed to operate over a broad wavelength range from 1000nm to 15m. The system will also have the capability of producing single-pixel image over this spectral range.The SWIR/MIR/FIR detector characterization system consists of multiple light sources covering the full spectral range, imaging camera and alignment optics to direct the light to the detector area, beam control mechanism to control the irradiation area to the object for single-pixel image formation, probe station and microscope to make detector contact at the die level without packaging, and electronics for measurement of dark current, photocurrent, frequency dependentnoise, sensitivity and speed. To our best knowledge, there is not a single equipment vendor that sells such a system with all the desired features and functions covering such broad spectral range. Therefore, we will acquire light sources from one vendor, optics from another, and electronics from the other. The graduate students will put the parts together to set up such a system. We also foresee the need to control the temperature of the device when we measure its MIR and FIR characteristics for certain designs of CEP detectors. Therefore, we plan to set up the proposed system next to an existing cryochamber in our laboratory. The cryochamber has a device probe station, electric feedthroughs and optical windows so that the CEP detectors can also be characterized at cryogenic temperature with the proposed system when low temperaturemeasurements are needed.We propose to set up a CEP detector characterization system for SWIR/MIR/FIR wavelengths because CEP detectors have shown highly promising properties at visible wavelength, including high gain under low bias, ultralow noise, large (> 2THz) gain-bandwidth product, and single photon sensitivity. These properties are particularly attractive to DoD applications in the areas of imaging, sensing, and communication. One significant finding with CEP detectors is that the gainmedium can be made of disordered material such as amorphous silicon. Disordered materials have been considered to be unsuitable for high performance detectors because they contain a large number of defects and have low carrier mobility. The principle of cycling excitation process (CEP) fundamentally changes the conventional notion of material quality as those defects actually play positive roles in the CEP process and contribute to high gain and sensitivity. Above all, amorphous silicon and other disordered materials can be formed on different light absorption materials without the constraints of lattice match, offering great flexibility in detector spectralrange and process compatibility. A system that can be used to characterize CEP detectors at SWIR/MIR/FIR wavelength can serve a variety of applications of DoDs interest.less",

We have identified existing datasets that can be enhanced to incorporate more detailed information about capabilities and interaction in and across various domains. Augmenting existing data with information about cross-domain deterrence is much more efficient and cost-effective than attempting to create entire new coding schemes for conflict behavior. Conducting innovative tests of cross-domain crises and conflict also necessitates the development of new variables to capture the increase in complexity associated with technological innovation. Finally, we have a new measure of how uncertainty about a state\u2019s capabilities varies across domains.

The biosensor platform that we are currently developing for the DoD will house 2,000 strains of S. cerevisiae and E. coli and will detect many toxins of concern to national security. The current design will make use of existing GFP libraries in these two species, in which each gene is paired with a GFP reporter. These strains will be patterned on a microfluidic device, and the pattern of responses from the fluorescent strains will be used to identify the presence and concentration of target toxins. While this approach will likely be successful in detecting many agents of interest, an expanded effort to include other species in which such libraries do not exist will vastly increase the number and types of water-borne agents that we can detect. In order to transform and characterize the response of new species, we will require a robotic laboratory workstation with the ability to perform highthroughput liquid handling in a highly customizable fashion.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Understanding the cascade of energy injected into the ocean is crucial to developing our knowledge of ocean predictability and dynamics. Steep ridges, islands, and atolls in the ocean scatter waves and convert energy at a variety of scales, from long Rossby waves through mesoscale, sub- ?mesoscale, and internal waves. This energy injected at the steep ridges has significant implications for global and regional ocean prediction. Models with insufficient resolution, or which lack the physics of the energy cascade will miss the topographic effects and suffer a drop in predictive skill. These localized effects may play an important role in the basin- ?wide circulation that is currently predicted by the Navy\u2019s global HYCOM/NCODA system. We propose a unique multi- ?model approach to examine how the cascade of energy and enstrophy impact global and regional predictive skill in the FLEAT region. We will employ two state- ?of- ?the- ?art numerical models nested within the global HYCOM using advanced state estimation techniques to reproduce the flows in the FLEAT region. Our goal is to examine the effects of local energy conversion at and near ridges, how the enstrophy affects local ridge and shelf physics, and how the energy cascade affects lower wavenumbers away from the ridge in the open ocean. By assimilating data at a wide variety of scales into models of varying physics, we will examine how the control vectors account for \u201cmismatches\u201d in resolved energy between island- ?scale, medium- ?scale regional, and large- ?scale global models. The control vector will provide information about how the unresolved information is fed \u201cout\u201d to the global HYCOM model even without online, two- ?way nesting. We will collaborate with FLEAT investigators (Drs. Hemantha Wijesekera of NRL, Eric Terrill, Dan Rudnick, and Matthew Alford of SIO/UCSD, Mark Merrifield of UH, and others) to: (i) gain access to a significant variety of data sampled during the program; (ii) provide model estimates of the flow to collaborators to provide context for the observations; and, (iii) work with collaborators to develop ways of representing (via parameterization or other methods) small- ?scale processes in the global- ?scale models. We will use MITgcm and ROMS, both nested within the US Navy\u2019s global HYCOM model. Lessons learned will be shared with the NRL development group led by Dr. Gregg Jacobs.less",

This involves establishing assessment methods and improving materials and processes to the level of reliably insuring removal of contaminants, achieving a desired level of percent fill of the delamination area (current F/A-18 process requires 50%), and ultimately recovery of strength. Being able to take credit for strength restoration from injection repairs would permit such repaired components to be used further in service at much reduced cost than extensive cutout repairs or full part replacement. Expected Outcomes. The expected final products from this research are: (i) More quantitative-based understanding of contamination state within delaminations found on in-service aircraft.

        "abstract": "Extremely heterogeneous networks (xHetNets) are emerging as a new paradigm to connect the increasingly diverse wireless devices in both civil and tactical scenarios. In particular, the xHetNets which tightly integrate millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-6 GHz radio interfaces have witnessed a prominent growth in recent years. Whereas mmWave wireless links can easily provision ultra-broadband capacity owing to the massive spectrum resources, they suffer from significantly higher attenuation loss, and have to rely on directional, electronically steerable beams to compensate for the pathloss. Such flexible and directional links in turn raise new challenges and opportunities in network architecture, protocols, and security, especially when coupled with the omnidirectional low-frequency links. The exploration of such challenges entails a flexible experimental testbed which allows full control and monitoring across the wireless network stack. Yet no such xHetNet testbed exists that comprises programmable heterogeneous radios and allows experimentation at moderate scale. This DURIP proposal aims to fill the gap by establishing a 20-node xHetNet testbed called RayNet. The testbed comprises a mix of static, UAV-mounted, and ground robot nodes, to emulate a tactical mesh network deployment. Each node integrates a sub-6 GHz software radio and a low-cost but powerful mmWave software radio that the PI recently developed. The mmWave software radio supports up to 256 antenna elements, forming 128 beam patterns with real-time programmability. The software radios enable RayNet to become the first xHetNet testbed with full-stack programmability. RayNet will be used to facilitate 4 ongoing research projects involving 5 PIs in the DoD Center for Networked and Configurable Command, Control and Communications (NC4) along with collaborators in ARL. It will also enable a wide spectrum of DoD-relevant future research topics, ranging from networked command-and-control algorithms, resource allocation and interference management for directional mmWave links, AI-driven dynamic routing and 3D topology adaptation for UAV-based xHetNet, transport layer for aggregation of heterogeneous network paths, all the way up to network security and applications. Through RayNet, the PI team will formulate experiment-centric tasks to attract and train student researchers. The RayNet testbed will be operated continuously for at least 10 years and will be sustained through federal grants and community support.

        "abstract": "Between the surf zone and the deeper, the inner shelf is the stratified region where turbulent surface and bottom boundary layers co,mprise a substantial portion of the water column, separated by a spatially and temporally variable, stratified region in between. In,ner shelf dynamics are influenced both by low-frequency wind-driven currents and high-frequency processes, including highly energeti,c internal waves and turbulence. The vertical distributions of buoyancy and momentum within the inner shelf are largely determined b,y turbulent fluxes, which are driven by high-frequency processes but have a significant aggregate impact on low-frequency flows thro,ugh changes in stratification and effective turbulent viscosity. Much of the turbulence is driven by nonlinear internal tides that e,volve significantly as they propagate across the shelf into shallow water. These nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) are modulated by t,he background stratification and currents, which evolve significantly on synoptic to seasonal timescales. The complex interactions c,onnecting low-frequency dynamics, stratification, currents, high-frequency internal wave evolution, and magnitude and vertical struc,ture of turbulence make it challenging to obtain a simple closure of inner shelf dynamics. Here we propose to explore these intercon,nected inner shelf dynamics through a focused analysis of a recently collected dataset of unprecedented scope. This project will uti,lize the highly resolved ISDE observations to elucidate how low-frequency currents and stratification on the inner self both impact, and are impacted by internal waves through the generation of turbulent dissipation. There are 3 distinct aims. In Part I, we will e,valuate the combined influence of background currents and stratification on the cross-shelf evolution of internal tides. In Part II,, we will identify the variability of the vertical structure of turbulence throughout the shelf and determine the leading mechanisms, of turbulence generation that underlie these patterns. Part III uses an event-scale analysis of wave characteristics and vertical s,tructures of turbulence to assess how variability in the internal wave field ultimately impacts the feedback on the shelf. Collectiv,ely, these analyses will clarify the contribution of internal tides to low-frequency inner shelf conditions and inform the improved, parameterization of these inter-connected dynamics in numerical models.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT (publicly releasable) ONR - Dr. Scott Harper (N00014 [322]) The boundary current south of Sri Lanka represents an important exchange mechanism for freshwater/salt between the very salty Arabian Sea and the very fresh Bay of Bengal. The flow controls muchof the freshwater/salt budget of both basins, and contributes to their stratification, including that of the mini warm pool in the Arabian Sea which is the topic of the new ONR program ASTraL. While the boundary current has a typical width of 150km, the freshwater from the Bay of Bengal flows in sometimes a very narrow ribbon of 20-50km width, some of which is over the continental shelf. Thisis very difficult to capture observationally, and models of the flow do not yet agree well with the (broader scale) observations, and satellite salinity from the SMAP mission lack resolution near the coast to capture these flows. In the prior ONR programs ASIRI and MISO-BOB we had demonstrated the synergy between glider sections (operated by the University of Washington, UW) and PIES (pressure sensing inverted echosounder) sections from our team, for observing the boundary current transport variability around Sri Lanka. We believe this can now be modified for capturing the full freshwater transports south of Sri Lanka, by using gliders for the freshwater transport in the region 50-150km offshore (outside the heavy shipping traffic), two PIES for the volume transport inshore of that, plus a simple mooring on the continental shelf measuring currents and salinity close to the coast. This combination would allow to fully resolve and quantify the freshwater import into the Arabian Sea, to test models with respect to that process, and to calibrate satellite methods for observing the freshwater flux. PIES already exist and are still located in Sri Lanka, and new glider operations will be proposed by UW, thus the only new equipment needed is instrumentation for the shelf mooring. This DURIP proposal requests sensors and instrumentation for operating the above shelf mooring (together with the existing PIES and gliders) for several one-year deployments, in close cooperation the Sri Lankan agency NARA. The base project requires 2 ADCP current meters, 6 moored CTD (temperature/salinity) sensors, and 2 acoustic releases. An option would add oxygen and pH sensors to address upwelling dynamics and ocean acidification impacts, which are of acute interest to Sri Lanka and NARA, which would leverage the proposed mooring and in turn supplement the regular ship surveys by NARA on which we would rely for background data and vessel access.less",

Capabilities include a towed continuity, temperature and depth sensor, a velocity sensor and a turbulence sensor. Several DOD-relevant research interests in physical oceanography require detailed measurements of flow, shear and turbulent mixing in depths below 500 meters (e.g. deep transport, lee waves, bottom drag, and flows associated with continental slopes, abyssal hills and submarine canyons). Currently these observations are made using shipboard rosettes using a technique referred to as \"tow-yo\": raising and lowering the rosette while advancing the ship at slow speed (0.5 to 0.8 knots). However, shipboard rosettes are inadequate for this application because they 1) sweep water from their turbulent wake past the sensors during ship heaves, resulting in uncorrectable data spikes in temperature and salinity; 2) are not designed to be towed laterally and result in damage to the tow cable; and 3) are extremely limited in their ability to power additional sensors and to receive data from them. To address these shortcomings, we propose building an innovative new towed vehicle with a state-of-the-art power transmission and data telemetry system, a hydrodynamic design that will eliminate the turbulent wake-spiking effect while also allowing higher towing speeds (up to 3 knots), a high-precision motion sensor for improved velocity and turbulence estimates, and a modular configuration to facilitate easy operation and maintenance by shipboard marine technicians. The proposed instrument will enable more rapid and reliable measurements of flow, shear and turbulent mixing in depths below 500 meters than are presently possible. The proposed system will be constructed, tested and initially operated with the goal of creating an instrument that can be used as a shared-use asset that will enhance the capability of ONR-owned oceanographic research vessels operated by SIO.less",

        "abstract": "Locomotion of robots within the ocean has largely focused on studies of swimming and other fluid-based forms of propulsion. However, there are many applications and opportunities for mul- timodal soft robots that are able to transition between interacting with the ocean surface, the water column, the seafloor, and burying below the seafloor surface. Such multimodal behaviors in the ocean require effective interactions between the body of a robot, water, and the complex granular, sediment, and biomass substrate that is the seafloor. To develop robots that are capable of effec- tive multimodal locomotion in the ocean, we seek to develop mechanical models that describe the forces and torques of robot appendages experience when interacting with interfaces, including floating on the surface, and penetrating, dragging, and oscillating, within the substrate. This proposal describes a Multimodal Ocean Soft Robot testing platform (referred to as the MOSoRo). This platform consists of a high-precision robot arm for the controlled movement of soft robot components that will interact with water and a seafloor simulant housed in a ocean simulation tank. A submersible motion capture system will be used for tracking the pose and deformation of soft robotic components attached to the robot arm that may deform in complex ways during interactions. Lastly, we will instrument the robot arm with a variety of force, deformation, and pressure sensors for mechanical characterization of the soft-robot interactions with the fluid air interface, the immersed fluid, and the seafloor. The MOSoRo platform will initially be directed to address three fundamental questions of interaction mechanics: 1) how can soft-bodied worm-like robots effectively bury and locomote within the seafloor?, 2) how can soft bodied robots transition from swimming in water to burying in the seafloor?, and 3) how can soft robots anchored in the ocean surface extract energy from deformation caused by wave motions? These initial questions will support two ongoing ONR- funded DoD projects devoted to robot development for Naval applications, and build off knowledge gained during two recently completed ONR-funded projects. Looking beyond these questions, we seek to develop general models to understand and predict the forces soft robots experience when anchored to or moving within the seafloor. These models will enable rapid development of future robots for Naval applications. Beyond robotics applications, the deformation mechanics of the seafloor are of critical interest to biologists who study worms, fish, and other multimodal organisms that bury and locomote in the ocean. Through established collaborations with Marine biologists at UC San Diego, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, we will perform experiments that improve understanding of multimodal animals in the ocean.less",

        "abstract": "While the capability of the U.S. to maintain space domain awareness (SDA) in the confines of the traditional orbits out to the geosynchronous belt is mature, the extreme range, difficult observing geometries, and unstable astrodynamics create particular challenges associated with conducting SDA in the cislunar environment. The ability to quantify, assess, and predict the behavior of objects in space is foundational to Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and SDA, and the trustworthy detection and characterization of orbital events is essential to the assessment of potential threats to our Nation\u2019s assets in space. These remain pressing problems in the classical circumterrestrial regime, but present unique and diverse difficulties for the vast cislunar domain. In an SSA context, for example, both the modest stationkeeping for orbit maintenance in libration point trajectories, as demonstrated by the NASA ARTEMIS spacecrafts, and the intrinsic sensitivity of these trajectories on account of spacemanifold dynamics can serve to complicate attempts to maintain custody of an object in this unstable orbital environment. It is precisely these distinctive dynamical features, including rapid uncertainty propagation, that frustrate SSA but enable novel spacemission concepts that are not simply predicated by Keplerian motion. This basic research effort proposes using a novel methodology, grounded in astronomical heritage, to develop a unique dynamical cartography and orbit fingerprint for classifying cislunar space objects (CSOs) and improving both maneuver-anomaly detection and orbitprediction capabilities in the complex cislunar environment. This research has two main components- (1) we will provide a dynamical atlas of the entire cislunar 'coneof shame' region (i.e., lunar exclusion zone), leveraging this for surveillance design strategies? and (2) work out the theory of proper elements for CSO dynamical taxonomy and maneuver detection.less",

        "abstract": "The Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) is a pulsed power driven plasma discharge that emits copious X rays and energetic particles, such as electrons, ions and neutrons. The discharge is initialized from a surface breakdown at the insulator sleeve that separates the anode and cathode in a coaxial geometry. Then, the plasma peels off of the insulator surface due to the Lorentz (JxB) force and moves along the coaxial electrodes, sweeping the background gas with it. At the end of this run down phase, when the plasma sheath reaches the end of the electrodes, it turns over and compresses on axis. Charged particles in these devices are accelerated by intense electromagnetic fields produced by instabilities formed during the final radial compression phase. Neutrons, on the other hand, are mainly generated by the beam target mechanism as a byproduct of the instabilities. Even though instability formation and particle acceleration are well known processes in DPFs, open questions regarding particle generation still remain, warranting further investigation. The breakdown and the run down phases in DPF are believed to play a key role on the final radial pinch phase. The breakdown phase depends on several factors, including insulator sleeve dimensions and surface properties. There has been limited work on the study of current initiation. The gas pressure and insulator sleeve dimensions can significantly affect the quality of the pinch and neutron yield. There has not been a comprehensive effort to systematically study the underlying physics and potentially control the initial breakdown phase and its effect on particle energy and yield. Experimental and modeling work is therefore warranted to address the critical aspect of pinch dynamics.less",

It represents a major source of uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery. The characterization of these dynamics is thus of operational importance to the Navy. Investigating small-scale processes requires dense spatial sampling over long distances with high temporal resolution. Our group has signi cant experience utilizing Fiber Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) systems to measure oceanic variability on 5 meter scales over kilometers for periods of weeks to months. This technology has only recently become su ciently sensitive for oceanographic work. Here we propose to purchase a high-resolution Fiber Optic Distributed Temperature Sensing System (DTS) and develop a simple, modular winch to deploy multi-kilometer lengths of optical ber in a variety of oceanographic settings. The DTS is envisioned for use during the Langmuir Cell DRI, where it will observe the detailed temperature structure in the mixed layer during the onset and evolution of Langmuir circulation. It also would be of great utility in the Air-Sea Interaction DRI, where it could be used to separate internal wave variability from submesoscale dynamics, and the Inner Shelf DRI, where it could track the in uence of internal waves on inner-shelf dynamics. We anticipate that the optical-based DTS system will become a mainstream sensor in numerous coming DRIs that involve .01-10 kilometer- scale processes. All of the PIs on this proposal supervise graduate students, and it is expected that this technology will form a signi cant component of a number of Ph.D. projects. The Fiber Optic DTS system represents transformative transformative ocean technology, and our group is well-positioned to develop its potential bene t to the Navy and the scienti c community.less",

        "abstract": "Variations in atmospheric refractivity near the surface affect electromagnetic signal propagation and can have significant impacts\" on communications and radar, which is an area of significant interest to ONR. Numerical weather models are employed to forecast conditions which may be problematic for these technologies. For example, the US Navy~s Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) was used to investigate the predictability of marine boundary layer structures and ducting layers generated by strong sea surface temperature gradients.Such refractivity gradients can be measured with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation measurements, in particular GNSS radio occultation signals recorded from aircraft, to understand more comprehensively the environment in which the ducting layers form.We developed a GNSS (inclusive of both GPS and Galileo) airborne radio occultation system that retrieves high resolution vertical profiles of the atmosphere in the near track environment of a high-altitude aircraft. The proof-of-concept system was flown in a hurricane research field campaign and the results of data assimilation of the profiles into the Weather and Research Forecasting model showed the impact on the hurricane track and intensity. In the analysis of the data from these flights, we discovered that the conditions associated with boundary layer structure are evident in the spectral analysis of the refractive bending angle data, with high verticalresolution.Since then, we have developed and flown a simplified version of the system in North Pacific winter storms, in particular for the atmospheric rivers reconnaissance flights in 2015, 2018, and 2019. Targeted observations were made from the NOAA G-IV and Air Force C-130 aircraft based on the COAMPS adjoint estimate of sensitive regions to investigate the predictability of precipitation at landfall on the west coast US. The system records profiles in regions to the side of the flight path that are not sampled by dropsondes that are released directly below the aircraft, so the observations are highly complementary for effective use of flight time and coverage of the sensitive region. This simplified system tracks the upper part of the atmosphere, above 3-5 km on average, and has enabled us to make great progress in the retrieval and analysis techniques, to evaluate the impact of observations that sample upper level dynamics of the extratropical cyclones. This proposal seeks to acquire an upgraded and miniaturized version of the full GNSS airborne radio occultation system including the raw RF recorder and software receiver with open-loop tracking to extend the capabilities into the boundary layer. The new version will have the latest in data storage and processing capability and expanded capability for 7 channels available for additional antennas. In this way, the previous 300 lb 5-foot tall instrument rack can be replaced with a 3U rack unit which can be easily installed in a wide variety of aircraft. With a 7-channel system we will be able to record simultaneously occultation signals of the lower atmosphere and boundary layer as well as reflected signals that contain information on sea surface roughness andwinds. Understanding the signal propagation effects not only helps characterize ducting in the boundary layer, it also improves derivation of ARO profile measurements of atmospheric temperature, and moisture, that in turn feed back into better weather forecasting in the marine environment through data ass\"imilation.less",

The opportunistic collection of eDNA from oceanographic research vessels provides an opportunity to greatly expand our knowledge of the distribution of protected marine mammals, sea turtles, and other key taxa. This project convenes a working group of experts in shipboard marine operations, eDNA sampling, molecular biology, and marine mammal genetics to design and carry out a pilot to identify the best implementation strategy for opportunistic sampling onboard vessels in the UNOLS fleet. The working group will be divided into task groups assessing procedures for eDNA collection, extraction, sequencing, analysis, and archiving. Task group findings will be incorporated into a protocol for the pilot study which will be executed by marine technicians onboard a UNOLS coastal class vessel. Multiple methods are available for most steps in the eDNA collection and analysis pipeline. The working group will make recommendations based on available data, however, in some cases more data may berequired to select or optimize the best method. An option is included for a cross-calibration study following the pilot to identify the best methods for key steps in the eDNA collection and analysis pipeline. At the end of the project period the working group will produce a report on the methods used in the pilot and recommendations for scaling to additional vessels in the UNOLS fleet.less",

        "abstract": "High performance fighter aircraft subsystems are routinely monitored to a very high degree, with over 1700 data streams recorded on the F22A Raptor, enabling a high degree of \"forensic\" analysis of any inflight \"incident\". Yet curiously the degree of monitoring of the pilot of the aircraft is minimal at best, despite the fact that the pilot is a critical element in any flight. A well-recognized risk in flight is hypoxia, and recent issues with the F22A fleet involving \"hypoxia-like incidents\" have had operational impact. Despite an extensive investigation a definitive cause of these incidents is not fully understood, in part due to a lack of information on the status of the pilot. While monitoring of arterial O2 saturation via oximetry is available, this is a poor indicator of initial hypoxia as the PO2 in the blood can fall substantially with little change in the O2 saturation, and because there is significant time lag between the onset of hypoxia and fall in Sao2 at the monitoring site (fingertip or forehead). Early on-set detection of hypoxia is essential. This proposal is a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate pilot-side physiological monitoring as an important complement to the engineering data already available on the aircraft. Taken together, the physiological and engineering data streams would allow an accurate and relevant forensic analysis of any future hypoxia-like incident, covering both critical systems; pilot and aircraft.less",

The drifters will be fabricated by the Lagrangian Drifter Laboratory (LDL) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), with ruggedized battery packs to extend the drifter\u2019s lifetime, an Iridium transmitter, and a GPS receiver. The expected lifetime of the drifters, which will measure SST at a depth of 20 cm in the standard configuration, is approximately two years. Since the standard SST sensor and the drogue are located at different depth, some of the drifters will be equipped with an additional (inductive) temperature sensor at the top of the drogue (SVP-2T) to explore this potential source of inaccuracy in the proposed effort (Figure 2). This is particularly important in the presence of surface freshwater lenses that can lead to significant near-surface temperature gradients. The drifters will be registered under the Global Drifter Program (GDP), which in turn will be financially responsible for the satellite transmission costs. In exchange, the drifter data will be made publicly available in real time through the Global Telecommunication System of the World Weather Watch and will therefore be easily accessible in real time by all the major forecast centers including the US Navy.

        "abstract": "Abstract The inner shelf is a region of variable stratification and wind stress, with flows dependent on a variety of physical mechanisms occurring both in regions deeper and shallower than the inner shelf. Here surface and bottom boundary layers at times overlap, complicating simple physical models appropriate for the outer shelf that distinguish between distinct turbulent boundary layers and a more quiescent interior. Turbulence, both in boundary layers and in the stratified water in between, is crucial for 1) transmitting momentum vertically through turbulent stresses (e.g. determining how much and when wind-driven flows ``feel\" the bottom), and 2) producing turbulent fluxes of heat, freshwater, pollutants and biologically essential nutrients. Here we propose to purchase five innovative new 5-beam ADCPs, along with requisite bottom tripods and mounting hardware, ideally for use as part of the \u201cInner Shelf\u201d DRI. With the purchase of the proposed instrumentation, the goals of the proposed work are to: * Understand the processes driving turbulent vertical/diapycnal mixing throughout the inner shelf, with an emphasis on the stratified water that exists between surface and bottom boundary layers; * Consider the implications of that turbulence for regional heat and momentum budgets, and *Develop physically accurate parameterizations of turbulent mixing and transports appropriate for the unique inner shelf environmentless",

A notable feature of this facility is that it permits experiments to be carried out in nonuniform ows. In contrast, experiments conducted employing shock tubes and rapid compression machines, do not include the in uence of ow on combustion. The HPCEF has been successfully employed to characterize combustion of many fuels in nonuniform ows at elevated pressures These studies have shown, for the rst time, the in uence of pressure on critical conditions of extinction of nonpremixed hydrogen, methane, ethane, and ethene ames, and the in uence of pressure on critical conditions of extinction and critical conditions of autoignition of reference fuels, jet fuels, and surrogates. These studies have highlighted the in uence of low temperature chemistry in promoting autoignition of high molecular weight hydrocarbon fuels. In view of the success of these previous studies at elevated pressures, additional funding was received from ARO to extend the maximum operating pressure of HPCEF from 25 bar to 60 bar. These studies provide fundamental knowledge that is relevant to the Army's need for high performance propulsion systems. High temperature and high pressure are encountered in these systems. The data at elevated pressures could be employed to test predictive models required to advance current understanding of fundamental chemical processes that characterize the combustion of jet fuels. To complete a set of experiments signi cant quantities of nitrogen and air are required. Previously these gases were supplied from pressurized gas cylinders. For example for conducting one set of experiments, nitrogen from twenty- ve pressurized gas cylinders and air from six pressurized gas cylinders were required. These gas cylinders need to replaced frequently. This was labor intensive and resulted in delay. The current support from ARO was used to upgrade the gas delivery system to allow higher supply of nitrogen and air to HPCEF with less frequent replacement of the pressurized gas cylinders. This improved gas delivery system has signi cantly enhanced current research capabilities and research-related education of our ARO supported research on combustion of jet fuels and surrogates at elevated pressures.less",

Recent evidence implicates a balanced host gut microbiota as crucial for memory retention, while gut microbiota effects on cognition are dependent on intact vagus nerve signaling. Sleep deprivation and circadian clock misalignment alters microbiota circadian clock gene expression and diversity. Altered gut microbiota influence behavior and learning that potentially highlight an indirect gut microbiota mediated pathway by which sleep deprivation effects memory and behavior. VNS (known to improve slow wave sleep quality) may substantially alter: 1) usual gut microbiota diversity change and 2) reduce learning degradation that occur with sleep deprivation. Degradation of performance under adverse conditions, particularly sleep deprivation, is an immediate human performance factor in military effectiveness. The purpose of this proposal is to explore novel targeted vagus nerve signaling to enhance human learning in the face of adverse conditions such as prolonged sleep deprivation. To complete this task we will determine the efficacy of novel vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) in working and declarative memory as well as autonomous trust tasks in healthy controls challenged with sleep deprivation. First, UCSD and Farus LLC will build a novel focused ultrasound therapeutic and imaging systems that: 1) can rapidly cycle and spatially steer the focus stimulation spot, and accurately identify (with interleaved recognition imaging) the vagus nerve, therefore avoiding neuronal damage [i.e., Multi-target Focused Ultrasound Vagal Nerve Stimulation (MtFUS-VNS)]. Second, we will compare efficacy of transcutaneous electrical vagal nerve stimulation (tEVNS) versus MtFUS-VNS in healthy controls challenged with sleep deprivation in the following warfighter operationally relevant tasks: 1) in an in MEG short term (working memory) N-back learning task, 2) in a long term (declarative memory) concealed object learning paradigm based on DARWARS Ambush! virtual reality environment task and 3) the Cognitive Command and Control (CogC2) autonomous decision aid and trust task. Who Cares? Sleep deprivation, ubiquitous in active duty warfighters, (up to 41% active military sleep < 5 hours per night), is known to result in unintentional, adverse errors. Rapid and efficient training are imperative to improve working memory and reaction time, both of which are critical to warfighter survival in sleep deprived combat environments. We will create the tEVNS and MtFUS-VNS working memory platform aimed to: 1) improve learning and 2) probe sleep deprivation effects on learning. This work has transformational potential to radically advance learning paradigms to provide a significant sleep-based performance advantage for the US warfighter.less",

Due to the nonlinear nature of shock waves and their interactions with non-uniform or moving media, solid or porous surfaces or other shock waves, predictions of shock dynamics and shock focusing events are far from trivial. Extreme conditions created at the focal region -- resulting in very high pressures and temperatures -- can be either beneficial or detrimental. As the shock wave emerges from the focal region after the shock focusing event, the shape of the shock is often fundamentally altered. Therefore, knowledge of the shock focusing process, and how to control it, is critical to fully understand its consequences and how to best enhance or mitigate it as needed depending on the application of interest. The proposed research project aims to deepen the understanding of shock wave focusing processes by studying the interaction of multiple synchronized converging shock fronts. In this research, experiments featuring an exploding wire setup will be combined with a hybrid analytical/numerical method. In particular, the goal is to tailor the shape of a 3D shock surface, consisting of multiple synchronized shock waves, such that the shocks coalesce upon a target area resulting in maximum pressure or impulse at the target area while at the same time reducing collateral damage away from the target area.less",

At Earth, a southward interplanetary magnetic field component in Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates (Bz negative) can couple with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field at the boundary of the magnetosphere causing geomagnetic storms. At the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) we have developed a way using IPS tomography techniques to accurately predict magnetic fields using Current\u2013Sheet Source Surface (CSSS) modeling. We use our technique in real time to forecast GSM Bz several days in advance, and now propose to extend this effort to higher resolutions in a variety of ways. The process we have developed allows an insertion of all three short term vector field components from the solar surface and can give an indication of the fields associated with CMEs, especially at their onset. 1) Here we will extend this study and provide a trace of these fields from near the solar surface to a source surface to provide inputs both for the extant UCSD kinematic tomographic model and 3 D MHD models. 2) We will also explore the propagation of these fields from their onsets near the solar surface to Earth to determine the timing and non radial transport of their components. 3) We will augment this model with our iterative ENLIL kernel that better refines shocks, and includes non radial transport caused by interactions and magnetic field effects in the inner heliosphere. 4) Finally, we will use the lines traced by these earlier studies to refine the mapping of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) from solar flaring sites, and heliospheric shocks to better characterize their heliospheric distributions and spectra.

        "abstract": "Noncontact Tomographic Condition Monitoring of Osseointegrated ProsthesisThe loss of a limb is one of the major reasons for disabi\"lity, but advances in prosthetic devices have improved the quality of life of amputees. Despite the numerous benefits offered by oss\"\"eointegrated prostheses, complications can arise during treatment and recovery. Therefore, the long-term vision of this research is\"\" to monitor in vitro the integration, performance, and condition of osseointegrated prostheses (and surrounding soft tissue) so as t\"\"o maximize treatment success, ensure patient compliance, and minimize recovery/rehabilitation times. As a step towards this long-ter\"\"m goal, the objective of this ONR project is to advance the scientific principles and applications of electrical capacitance tomogra\"\"phy (ECT) for rapid, noncontact, and noninvasive condition monitoring of transfemoral osseointegrated prostheses. Here, ECT and mult\"ifunctional nanocomposites integrated at human-prosthesis interfaces will be used for resolving highresolution cross-sectional electrical maps of the human-prosthesis system to: (1) quantifyprosthesis stress states; (2) identify fixture loosening; and (3) monitor\" subcutaneous infection. In short, an electrical field is propagated between electrodes arranged in a circular ring (which defines t\"\"he sensing domain). Perturbations to the field (e.g., due to changes in the features of the humanprosthesis system, such as loosenin\"\"g, load states, and infection) affect the electrical response measured at the boundary electrodes. Sets of input-output electrical e\"xcitations-responses can thenbe used to reconstruct an electrical image of the sensing area. Four research tasks will be conducted; the scope includes: (1) implementing a multi-frequency ECT algorithm and hardware; (2) designing multifunctional nanocomposites that enhance response quantities of interest; (3) characterizing the system for monitoring prosthesis loosening and stress/strain states; and (4)investigating the potential for infection monitoring by sensing pH.less",

        "abstract": "Here it is proposed to improve the active acoustic instrumentation available to PI Baumann-Pickering, other PIs at SIO as well as collaborators, and post-doctoral researchers, graduate, and undergraduate students working within various groups. It is intended to procure one mooring-based stationary active acoustic system using novel wideband technology to be added to a deep mooring. Proposed is the procurement of improved active acoustic instrumentation for integrated passive and active acoustic cetacean-prey studies. It is intended to obtain one ship-based mobile and one mooring-based stationary active acoustic system using novel wideband technology. This new method uses frequency modulated (sweep) signals instead of continuous frequency pulses. The improved system provides gradual frequency responses of targets and hence more detailed size classes and increased information on target species and angle of orientation. Additionally, for resolved single targets, this system allows for both high range resolution (using wide bandwidth) and long range (using long pulse duration) which used to be a compromise with recent systems. The ship-based active acoustic Simrad EK80 system is proposed to consist of a pole-mounted, four frequencies, mobile transducer array (MTA-4): 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz. A computer and monitor unit captures the data transmitted via Ethernet from four wideband transceivers (WBT) in a rack. The mooring-based stationary active acoustic system will be integrated into a passive acoustic mooring (~4000 m water depth), holding a passive acoustic recorder (HARP) at ~800 m depth. It will be improved with a wideband autonomous transceiver (WBAT) and transducer with a nominal frequency of 70 kHz that is capable of sweeping from 55 to 90 kHz. Additionally, a conductivity-temperature-depth recorder with oxygen sensor (MicroCAT CTD, SBE 37SMP-ODO) will be installed at the same depth as the WBAT system to provide information about the oceanographic condition at depth. These new systems can a) be used in short- and long-term monitoring by including predator-prey models, leading to improved cetacean predictability and mitigation during naval exercises and b) shed light on the relationship of acoustic backscatter and ambient sound across time and space, which is relevant to the U.S. Navy sonar community.

To address this challenge, Aptima and partners at The University of CaliforniaSan Diego propose to develop AeroQUEST (Aeromedcial Quantified Understanding via Experimental Standards Toolkit). AeroQUEST will be a distributed system enabling aviation medicine and human performance researchers to implement essential actions to design studies, execute study designs, and analyze collected data and results in a standardized fashion. The system will include a dynamic user interface that allows researchers to design, compare, and contrast current study designs with that of other labs, allow researchers to interface with a standardized set of sensors for data collection via the HPML standard, and allow researchers to analyze and disseminate data and study designs across laboratories as necessary.

        "abstract": "The objective of this proposal is to develop multiscale models in time and spatial coordinates in order to uncover the fundamental laws governing cellular motility. The proposal takes a two-pronged approach to answer two important questions remaining about cellular motility: 1) How does spatial compartmentalization of signaling (plasma membrane versus cytoplasm) affect motility responses? 2) How does cell shape change during cell motility? To answer these questions, Project 1 has to do with spatial compartmentalization of signaling reactions. Current models consider only solutions exhibiting little spatial structure. To remedy this problem, the assumption of a well-mixed system will be replaced by considering a reaction-diffusion system with the kinetics of the well-mixed model. Using this new model, the following studies will be carried out: a) Identification of the stability properties of this minimal cell polarity model. b) Extension of the analysis to a single-compartment model in two spatial dimensions. c) Extension to a 1D spatial model with two compartments (approximating a cross-section of the cell adjacent to the plasma membrane). d) Extension of the two-compartment model to two spatial dimensions. Project 2 has to do with change in cell shape in response to actin remodeling during cell motility. The following studies in this area will be carried out: a) Development of 1D and 2D models of cell motility in fixed coordinates, including appropriate biochemical kinetics in a well-mixed model. b) Development of a suite of hybrid simulation algorithms in which slow reactions and fluxes are handled through exact stochastic simulation and their fast counterparts are treated partially deterministically through chemical Langevin equations. c) Employment of upscaling techniques to derive effective equations for the average concentrations of key proteins involved in cell motility. d) To handle dynamic changes in cell shapeless",

        "abstract": "Semiconducting (pi conjugated) polymers have the potential to combine the electronic properties of inorganic semiconductors with the mechanical properties of plastic. Favorable charge transport properties and mechanical deformability are, however, in competition. For example, the rigid ? conjugated backbone and semicrystalline microstructure are necessary for charge transport but also tend to reduce the deformability. Despite these seemingly exclusive criteria, our laboratory and others have demonstrated materials that can be stretched by over 100% while retaining high charge carrier mobility. There are two challenges obscured by this progress. The first challenge is that the deformation is generally plastic, as opposed to elastic. The elastic range is by far the more important than the absolute \u201cstretchability,\u201d because a material that can only be stretched once before it deforms permanently will not be usable in most applications. The elastic range of most \u201cstretchable\u201d semiconducting polymers is small, ?10%. The second challenge is that most previous approaches to increasing the deformability of conjugated polymers have been based on intuition, e.g., increasing the length of the side chain and incorporating aliphatic spacers. These approaches are based on the assumption that the flexibility of the polymer chain directly translates into the deformability of the film. Our results contradict this assumption. The molecular structure influences the mechanical properties of the solid in large part insofar as it influences the solid state structure. The goals of this proposal are thus (1) to understand the mechanisms of elasticity at the molecular and microstructural level and (2) to increase the elastic range. Stretchable, ultra flexible, printable, and robust semiconducting polymers can provide energy for aerospace and satellite applications and can transduce signals for human and structural health monitoring.less",

Achieving this goal means that each warfighter needs to be at their peak ph,ysical/mental health and excels in their training and qualifications while preventing musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. Yet, what is m,issing are field-deployable, unobtrusive, wearable sensors that can be used during training, as well as in forward-deployed operatio,ns, to reliably assess and enhance warfighter physical function, performance, and MSK health. To address this technology gap, the PI, and his team, through ONR 6.1 funding, has successfully developed and validated a disposable, self-adhesive, elastic-fabric-based,,sensor (i.e., Motion Tape) that can be affixed practically anywhere on the skin/body to measure distributed skin-strains during move,ment. The sensing streams provided by these wearables, once fully developed, will provide personalized, detailed, and actionable war,fighter physical health and performance information which are simply unavailable today. Thus, the overarching goal of this project i,s to advance Motion Tape technology for evaluating MSK health, identifying preclinical signs of injuries, and enhancing physical per,formance/capabilities of the warfighter in diverse clinical, training, and forward-deployed settings. The first Aim will focus on de,veloping a scalable manufacturing protocol for producing high-quality nanocomposite fabric sensors of different forms, sizes, and de,signs that are suitable for different bodily regions and use cases. The second Aim will concentrate on controlled laboratory-based v,erification/validation tests of sensor performance. The extensive data streams collected will be processed and interpreted using sup,ervised machine learning (ML) methods to reveal insights about warfighter performance and health. The final Aim will entail close co,llaboration with other ONR program performers to conduct human subject studies with the objective of demonstrating the robustness, t,est-retest reliability, safety, and efficacy of Motion Tape in various relevant settings. The expected outcome is that the efficacy,of using Motion Tape for monitoring warfighter physical health and performance will be successfully demonstrated. The broader impact, is that the proposed sensors, tests, and ML algorithms will help transform how the military assesses, trains, and manages its activ,e duty, reserve, and veteran personnel. This added technological capability can potentially improve warfighter combat readiness, ret,ention on duty, and rapid return to service post-injury to collectively achieve asymmetrical advantage and overmatch against adversa,rial forces.less",

        "abstract": "The development of optically detectable calcium, voltage and cellular energy-sensing indicators have made it possible to record neural activity from large numbers of neurons at high temporal resolutions. However, linking neural activity to behavior remains a challenge, because most existing imaging paradigms and model organisms suffer from at least one of the following issues- 1) behaviorally restrained subjects, 2) poor coverage of the brain, or 3) limited behavioral and cognitive complexity. Consequently, it remains largely unknown how complex brain functions arise from the coordinated actions of large numbers of neurons across the brain. The goal of this study is to develop a method for monitoring chronic long-term brain-wide neural activity in freely behaving fruit flies at single-cell resolution, which approximately resolves all of the fore-mentioned issues. The advantage of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lies in its powerful genetic and molecular tools useful for recording and manipulating neurons, as well as its relatively small brain that is capable of displaying highly complex behavior and cognition. Here we propose a novel opto-mechanical design that enables in vivo brain imaging at single-cell resolution in freely behaving fruit flies. We will perform chronic long-term neural activity recordings of brain-wide neuromodulatory circuits to visualize changes of information flow in,the brain brought about by stress (and rebound from it), a type of experiment and data that has thus far been unavailable in the field. Because of the conserved array of eurochemicals between fly and mammalian brains, this will allow us to eventually relate our findings to the mammalian brain with the goal of making testable predictions of relevant circuitry and regional interactions. Furthermore, this integrated system\u2019s capabilities will make it possible to formulate a theoretical basis for large-scale neuronal coding underlying higher cognitive functions. Understanding this process, in turn, holds substantial promise for applications in computing and engineering.less",

Current classification methods require near exact replication of the original imaging parameters, or extensive modeling in order to generalize the signature to novel operating conditions. By understanding the physical constraints on the target information, one can better construct and refine a classification system. We will show how recent bounds, developed for electromagnetic scattering, work equally well for optical wavelengths, and we propose to use these bounds to develop tools to explore feature salience. BENEFIT: The primary benefit of successful completion of this effort is improved exploitation systems wherein we can explicate why and where features are informative. This capability has numerous commercial applications in various business sectors such as defense, communication, and medical imaging.less",

        "abstract": "Acoustic vector sensors have the capability of measuring both the pressure and particle velocity of an underwater acoustic field, which permits them to measure the directionality and other spatial characteristics of a sound field from a single point. Over the past two decades, a new generation of acoustic vector sensors, sold by the Wilcoxon Sensing Company, have become available with higherbandwidths and smaller volumes than previous vector sensors. The ability to measure low-frequency sound directionality from a compact and low-power package makes them appealing candidates for deployment from autonomous platforms, where the deployment of large-aperture volumetric hydrophone arrays is either undesirable or impractical. Two Office of Naval Research Task Force Ocean grants are currently seeking to incorporate these sensors into both autonomous deep-drifting (grant number N00014-21-1-2953; PI Aaron Thode) and Wave Glider platforms (grants number N00014-21-1-2791 & N00014-21-1-2558;PIs Luc Lenain and Karim Sabra). Both projects are currently using off-the-shelf data acquisition systems (DAQ) that consume high amounts of power and are not optimized for reading the simultaneous analog and digital data generated by these sensors. The DAQ systems are also vulnerable to clock drift, so no time-synchronized data is available for coherent passive acoustic signal processing between platforms deployed simultaneously.This proposal will build twelve (12) autonomous vector sensor data acquisition modules (VS-DAQM) for UCSD/SIO in collaboration with the Keyport NavalUndersea Warfare Center (NUWC), an organization that has already built a prototype low-power DAQ specifically designed for acquiring both acoustic and NAS data from Wilcoxon sensors. NUWC will expand the design of the board to enable archival data storage for upto two weeks of continuous recording from four channels, programmable hibernation and duty cycling modes, internal and external power management capabilities, and external time synchronization. These redesigned electronics will then be manufactured and packaged with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery system into a pressure case (1000 m depth limits) with a custom-designed cage mounted on oneendcap, that limits both mechanical vibration and flow noise contamination. The battery pack will permit at least 72 hours of continuous recording from the sensor, and up to two weeks under a duty cycle or with external power supplied. NUWC will retain two modules to permit further software development and debugging, and six additional vector sensors will be purchased to supplement existingsensors already owned by the university so that all twelve units have dedicated sensors.Existing commercial and previous DURIP-funded data acquisition systems cannot sample both analog and digital data, and do not allow external synchronization signals. Furthermore, there are strategic long-term advantages in permitting university oceanographic institutions to collaborate with a Navy lab that has practical experience working with these sensors. These advantages include an ability to easily customize and upgrade the DAQ software and memory capacity based on evolving sensor designs and applications, a flexibility not offered by commercial systems. The equipment has numerous additional future applications for other bottom-mounted and mobile platform applications, including an upcoming DARPA program for monitoring fish and crustacean settlement on artificial reef structures.This abstract is publicly releasableless",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the local three-dimensional environment is critical for effective mission execution, particularly for autonomous vehicles. LIDAR optical ranging and imaging offers the potential to improve ranging speed and accuracy. LIDAR ranging provides a high-fidelity geometric representation of the environment, with reflectivity strength preserving optical contrast, two features very useful for automatic target recognition (ATR). However, optical solutions are limited by water turbidity, which scatters light and limits the effect range and resolution of LIDAR underwater. Creare proposes to develop the high-resolution underwater LIDAR (HRUL). The HRUL features flexible conditioning and processing of the received optical return that adaptively adjusts the optical processing scheme to maximize ranging resolution for the local water turbidity. Modern advances in pulsed fiber lasers, optical modulation, optical sensing, time-of-flight calculation, and embedded processing allow the HRUL to achieve mission-relevant area coverage rates (order 1 million three-dimensional points per second) and ranging resolution (sub-centimeter) in a low size, weight, and power package suitable for integration with an autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV). In Phase I we will demonstrate our novel optical processing approach and in Phase II we will build a full-scale system for integration with an AUV.less",

It is a consequence of the depths at the divers must operate at; at high ambient pressures, nitrogen dissolves into the blood at tissues, and this dissolved nitrogen later forms bubbles as the pressure decreases. The injuries resulting from this disorder can range from mild to life-threatening. It is difficult to predict the impending onset of DCS during a dive since there have been no means of identifying gas embolisms within divers while they are underwater. Large gas embolisms are typically monitored using ultrasound methods after a dive has taken place.   It has been shown, however, that the formation of larger gas embolisms characteristic of DCS are usually preceded by the occurrence of much smaller bubbles, with dimensions of microscale length. If microbubbles could be detected at physiological concentrations during a dive, then decompression stress may be identified earlier, and measures could be taken to prevent further stress to the diver.

        "abstract": "We aim to quantify and control population transfer dynamics between polaritons and dark modes, in order to lay the foundation to prepare a macroscopic collective quantum vibrational state in vibrational polaritons. Chemical reactions involve collisions, electric- or photo-excitations to overcome reaction barriers. Only molecules with very high energy can react, and it has to occur before the energetic molecules dissipate their energy. This process is similar to nonlinear optics. In two-photon absorptions, excited molecules must absorb a second photon before relaxation occurs, which was made possible by the advent of laser. This is due to their high photon density and coherence that ensures multiple photons can interact with the same molecules constructively or destructively. This similarity between nonlinear optics and chemical reactions leads to the possibility of that a macroscopic collection of high-density, coherent excited molecular states can enhance many-body scatterings that lead to rapid accumulation of energy to activate chemical bonds and opening of new mechanisms for chemical reactions. To pursue this possibility, we will conduct the first step by measuring and optimizing dynamics of molecular vibrational polaritons. The specific aims are- (1) quantifying reservoir to polariton relaxation dynamics using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy; (2) optimizing reservoir to polariton relaxation dynamics by creating miniaturized optical cavity modes. 2D IR spectroscopy will be used to measure the reservoir-to-polariton mode relaxation dynamics, which will be done by intermolecular polaritonic vibrational transfer experiments and extracted from kinetic equations. The reservoir-to-polariton relaxation time scale will be optimized by customizing confined cavities on the scale of a few microns. These cavities will be manufactured using photo and e-beam lithographic tools. We anticipate the results will lay the foundation of a new approach to control chemical reactions, with a potential impact to the molecular polariton and chemical catalysis.less",

The overarching objective of this currentproject is to provide ability to quantitatively assess injection repair of delaminations, with theultimate goal being to allow this method to be relied upon as one returning strength to thecomponent. Two major instruments are proposed for purchase under the DURIP program: 1)Surfx Atmospheric Plasma System Atomflo 500, and 2) Hiden QGA Quantitative Gas Analyzer,type 305110; including Hiden HAL 201 RC mass spectrometer with Faraday/Multiplier detector.A critical aspect of successful adhesive bonding is surface preparation. This includes insuringthat contaminants are removed, and also imparting modification of the surface so that it isamenable to forming strong bonds with the adhesive or injection resin. The requestedinstruments enable the UC San Diego team to develop novel methods which address the surfacepreparation of internal delamination surfaces (i.e., not directly accessible) prior to injectionrepair.Furthermore, dedicated equipment located at UC San Diego, and not using equipmentlocated as part of a shop production environment, allows these systems to be 100% dedicated tothe projects use, and also allows custom modifications to the system (impossible when usingproduction-dedicated equipment). In the long-term, it is anticipated the findings of the currentinjection repair project would involve tech transfer to Navair, with need for parametricoptimization for various composite material types and configurations, contaminant sources, etc.The proximity of UC San Diego with FRCSW enables an ideal partnership to permit such nonstandardsystem optimization studies with lab-dedicated equipment not devoted to productionline environment.less",

The subsurface environment directly affects animal migration, sonar propagation, global weather patterns, and the primary productivity that underlies the ocean food chain. Most current methods for subsurface sensing require stationing of a research vehicle at each measurement point, resulting in limited spatial resolution, short observation periods, and high cost. An inexpensive, long-duration, three-dimensional sampling platform is needed. Creare, together with our research institution partner, the University of California, propose to develop a Bio-inspired Profiling Float to fill this unmet need. The Bio-inspired Profiling Float adapts a proven autonomous underwater platform to this mission through the addition of a jellyfish-inspired lateral propulsion mechanism and energy harvesting technologies. The integration of lateral propulsion in addition to the host platforms existing buoyancy control, will allow any individual Bio-inspired Profiling Float to drift along at a programmed depth profile or maintain station depending on mission requirements. Energy harvesting allows for unconstrained mission durations providing detailed, three-dimensional sensing with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.less",

        "abstract": "Mooring structures are used in oceanographic research to hold scientific instruments inplace at various depths throughout the wate\"r column. While they may be attached to surface buoys,it is often preferable to keep the entire structure below the surface to avoid ship traffic and surfacewaves. In these cases, the mooring wires are shorter than the water depth, and held upright by(submerged) flotation elements. Whenever ambient currents are strong, the moorings will beknocked down to some degree, depending on the amount of flotation and drag inflicted by thestructure itself. In applications where sampling at specific depths, especially in the upper watercolumn, is important, this results in an engineering challenge to minimize mooring knockdown.Here, acquisition of a buoyancy system composed of six specialized flotation elements is soughtthat will enable construction of an array of three moorings with minimal knockdown. These floatshave lower drag for a given amount of buoyancy than conventional floats (multiple 17~ glassspheres in plastic shells). The proposing investigators anticipate using such an improved mooringarray in the CALYPSO program. CALYPSO is an effort funded by ONR to investigate circulationnear a surface-intensified front in the Mediterranean Sea. CALYPSO~s need to make near-surfaceobservations despite strong surface currents is challenging for conventional subsurface mooringdesigns. The use of surface buoys instead is undesirable due to ship traffic and high cost. The lowdrag,high-buoyancy solution sought here provides the capability to make these measurementswith a subsurface mooring knockdown that is expected to be about four times smaller than thatobtained with conventional floats, which is a significant improvement that will benefit data qualityand better meet CALYPSO~s needs. Once these components are in hand, the ongoing operationalexpense for such moorings, already relatively low-cost, is also further reduced. The proposedbuoyancy components also take significantly less space on a research vessel, important for usingthe smaller ship ~SOCIB~ out of Mallorca.Simulating mooring knockdown for different configurations of buoyancy and currents is alreadypart of the class curriculum offered by the investigators at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.This happens in classes that teach observational methods of oceanography, and is open to studentsof oceanography as well as engineering. The flotation elements of this proposal will be integratedinto the mooring simulations done in class to enhance the learning experience for the futurestudents and train\" them for more challenging mooring applications.less",

Key research questions to be addressed are: 1. How has China been able to exploit access to foreign defense and dual-use technologies and how has the Chinese defense acquisition system been able to assimilate these inputs? 2. How successful have Chinese efforts been at absorption as well as the improvement of the acquired foreign technologies with integration of domestic inputs? 3. What role and influence does China\u2019s reliance on foreign technology transfers have on its publicly-stated goal of becoming a world-class defense innovation leader based on indigenous capabilities? 4. How, and to what extent, do recent Chinese defense technological innovations support the ability of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to protect the country\u2019s expanding international interests? 5. What are the implications for the US defense acquisition system and its defense industrial base? The project draws on several academic and policy-related disciplines for its methodological framework. They include business and management studies, and especially the concept of absorptive capacity. A second area of relevant scholarship is comparative international political economy and the study of industrial modernization in East Asian states during the late twentieth century, especially Japan and South Korea, which offer useful comparative insights of China\u2019s contemporary efforts at foreign technology transfers and its effectiveness in promoting economic development. The project will investigate the nature and state of China\u2019s industrial economy for the acquisition and absorption of foreign technologies, especially related to the defense industry. Four case studies will provide detailed explanations of how the Chinese technology transfer approach works. An examination of the impact of China\u2019s technology transfer efforts on the United States and its defense industrial base will focus on three areas: 1) the history and current state of China\u2012US defense technology ties; 2) Chinese efforts to acquire US defense technology through covert and other extra-legal means; and 3) Efforts by US authorities and the defense industry to counter Chinese attempts to acquire U.S. defense-related technologies.less",

We propose to purchase a high speed arbitrary waveform generator which is capable of generating any desired signal or waveform up to 6 GHz. This will interface with our existing high power amplifiers to enable us to perform a wide variety of high power microwave experiments for investigating methods of mitigating the effects of high power microwave weapons. It will have an immediate impact on our current program with ONR to develop nonlinear surface treatments for counteracting the effect of microwave directed energy weapons. It will also impact a planned follow-on program to further develop the surfaces, improve their bandwidth, and make them suitable for integration with realistic vehicle skins. Furthermore, with the increasing threat of microwave weapons that are available at low cost throughout the world, we expect that this issue will only be of greater importance to the DoD over time. Therefore, this instrument will establish at UCSD an important test capability for evaluating circuits, enclosures, and treatments against microwave weapons which will be useful on many future programs from a variety of government agencies.less",

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that alcohol use is associated with HIV infection. Military personnel, a population at risk for HIV, are no exception to the detrimental effects of alcohol use. However, there are certain aspects of military life that set this population apart from civilians in terms of alcohol and HIV risk. Historically, alcohol use has strong ties with military culture. Higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption and binge drinking have been reported in service members compared to civilians. Additionally, military service requires members to spend extended periods of time away from loved ones, which may increase loneliness and sexual tension. Studies have shown that military personnel deployed abroad were more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as having unprotected sex with commercial sex workers, compared to soldiers deployed locally. It is critical to address alcohol use and HIV risk among service members because alcohol use may increase risky sexual behavior, which may increase rates of HIV. Increased rates of HIV may lead to a less effective military, and a less effective military may decrease national security. In order to develop effective interventions, prevention strategies, and policies, a clearer understanding of the nature and extent of the relationship between alcohol use and sexual risk behavior is necessary. This proposal seeks to characterize alcohol use and sexual behavior in the context of HIV/AIDS risk among military personnel in three resource-limited settings: Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone.less",

        "abstract": "This proposal is submitted by Avanti Tech, LLC, a new company founded in 2008 as a spin off from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) NDE & Structural Health Monitoring group. In Phase I, the team will develop the technique of Piezoelectric Rosettes for the location of impacts in aerospace structures, which are complex in either their material constituents and/or their geometry. The Piezoelectric Rosette concept was first proposed in 2007 by the same UCSD researchers to circumvent the problems of conventional Time-Of-Flight (TOF) triangulation of Acoustic Emission (AE) events used for impact/damage location. Because the TOF triangulation usually assumes one value of AE wave velocity in the medium, it is inaccurate when the wave velocity changes with propagation direction (e.g. anisotropic composite panels, stiffened panels, multilayered panels, etc..) or with propagation distance (e.g. tapered sections). The proposed Piezoelectric Rosette technique does not require prior knowledge of the wave velocity in the medium, and it thus has the potential to provide more accurate AE source locations in complex aerospace structures. The 9-month work will first develop analytical models of the rosette response to AE waves, and subsequently test the technique on anisotropic panels subjected to realistic pendulum and gas-gun impacts. BENEFIT: The successful completion of Phase I work will lead to the concept demonstration of the Piezoelectric Rosette impact location in aerospace-type panels. The technique has the potential to revolutionize impact location strategies because it does not require prior knowledge of the wave velocity in the test structure, contrarily to the common AE triangulation methods. Hence the potential for more accurate impact locations in complex aerospace structures where the wave velocity changes either with propagation direction (anisotropic, multilayered or stiffened components) or with propagation distance (tapered components).   Once fully developed, the Piezoelectric Rosette technique can potentially replace TOF-triangulation in any impact-sensitive or damage-sensitive structure that is either heterogeneous or geometrically complex. Ideal applications will be military flying platforms (USAF, Army, Navy, Marines, Border Patrol, Coast Guard, etc..) as well as civilian composite flying platforms (Boeing 787, Airbus A380, etc..).  Commercialization efforts will include the filing of a provisional patent application, followed by communication with Boeing, Airbus and NASA to explore patent licensing interests.)less",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a shift in threats to US national security. Today increasing focus for national security is management of terrorist activities. Deliberately exposing a civilian population to chemicals and explosives to cause harm represents a looming terrorist threat. Early detection and identification is a difficult but essential element to minimizing the threat. The Seacoast Science/University of California San Diego team believes that a successful portable real time chemical detector must contain a suite of sensor technologies. Thus the ultimate goal with this program is to incorporate multiple miniature sensing technologies into a single portable unit. Individually any one technology may fall short, but used in concert many of their technical limitations are eliminated. We feel that this is the solution to the selectivity and reliability problems that plague most sensor systems. This technique will combine the strengths of the existing independent and uncorrelated detection technologies and minimize their weaknesses. The concept is simple but implementation will be very challenging and we believe this combination works well with the DOD STTR because the research to be carried out requires an interdisciplinary approach in which physicists, materials scientists, chemists and engineers collaborate, from academia and business, toward the same aim. BENEFIT: The development of an orthogonal chemical sensor based detector for chemical warfare agents and explosives would result in a system with improved selectivity, reliability and reduce the problems that plague current sensor systems, such as false alarms. This technology will be designed as dual use and would have great appeal not only with soldiers and marines, but with first responders.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Superconductor Technologies Inc. (STI) in collaboration with the laboratories of Professor R. C. Dynes at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, propose to thoroughly explore using arrays of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) for high frequency (HF) direction finding (DF) signals intelligence (SIGINT). The primary focus of our research program will be on the development of the superconducting components, namely the SQUID array and receive antenna. SQUID arrays and a test coil will be built using STI superconducting materials. In parallel, we will perform the other necessary studies for the development of a prototype system such as evaluating the noise performance of a SQUID array operating on a STI cryocooler and testing of high speed SQUID read-out electronics. We believe that the results of these experiments will enable a much improved DF technology for a possible phase II prototype unit. BENEFIT: We anticipate a significant number of benefits from this research. Those directly related to a DF system include: * Reduced antenna size for mobile platforms and stealth aircraft * Larger dynamic range to enhance detectibly of small signals in the presence of large interferences In addition, our work on Josephson junctions may benefit other prospective active superconducting devices such as Josephson waveform generators for RADAR or Josephson terahertz oscillators. Furthermore, coils fabricated from high-Tc coated conductors may benefit sensitive bio-magnetic medical imaging such as magneto-cardiogram (MCG).less",

The structure and properties of these materials under electrochemical conditions are different and these characteristics offer great potential for stabler, safer, more efficient memristive devices which consume less power. Meanwhile, defects in these materials play a critical role in resistive switching properties of solid state devices. Mesoscopic characterization and defect engineering on these materials are critical to the mechanistic understanding, especially when defects in these electrochemical energy materials are prone to vary under electrical bias, it is thus important to perform in situ characterization on defect properties to determine the property accurately. Neuromorphic device performances including stability and switching voltage will be also predicted based on the predicted binding energy and defect properties. A combination of advanced mesoscopic characterization tools and machine learning methodology will provide the pathway to energy materials for the neuromorphic computing application. Three key aspects will be enfolded: 1) Probing defect states in neuromorphic materials at both the atomic and mesoscopic scales; 2) Machine learning methodology for optimizing neuromorphic materials; 3) Neuromorphic performance evaluation via fabrication of electrochemically smart devices. We aim to discover new materials suitable for the neuromorphic devices based on the electrochemical energy materials. By combining in-situ mesoscopic characterization tools with machine learning guided methodology, we will predict the properties required for the neuromorphic application (e.g., defect states, structural configurations, phases, etc.). Performance of neuromorphic devices such as stability and switching voltage using newly discovered materials will be predicted by density function theory calculation and will be evaluated in device implementation. Our combined advanced characterization-computational methodology will guide and accelerate these novel materials to the neuromorphic application.less",

We plan to fly the modularaerial sensing system (MASS; Melville et al. 2016) on a light-twin aircraft over the coastand inner shelf in the area of Pt. Sal, California. This experiment, in which there will beboth good in situ measurements over specific areas of the inner shelf and numericalmodeling by other groups, will provide an excellent opportunity to remotely followprocesses of surface and internal wave evolution over the shelf, and study their role inmixing on the inner shelf. With the dissipation of the wave fields comes the generation ofcurrents and the generation of turbulent kinetic energy for mixing the water column. Thiseffort will build on our earlier field work on wave-induced mixing over coral reefs andlagoons.

The invesigators propose to undertake a comprehensive mapping of the mitochondrial proteomeusing mouse heart as a tissue source. Mitochondria will be isolated, purified and separated using a variety of protocols developed and optimized in-house.

The protein components of these subfractions will then be subjected to two complimentary mass spectrometry techniques. Data analysis using high-throughput informatics approaches will allow identification of these proteinswith high sensitivity.Furthermore, immunodepletion of high-abundance mitochondrial proteins (such as electron transport chain subunits) using specific antibodies will also be employed to identify mitochondrial proteins present at lower levels in these fractions.

        "abstract": "Monitoring Socket Prosthesis Interfaces using Distributed Pressure Fabric SensorsHundreds of thousands of people, including milita\"\"ry personnel, undergo limb amputations each year, which are caused primarily by either traumatic injury or peripheral vascular disea\"se. Amputees can be fitted with socket prostheses to help them regain functionality and resume physical activity. Despite the socket\" being customized, lower-limb amputees still suffer fromcomplications and discomfort while often developing painful, difficult and\"\" expensive to treat, and sometimes life-threatening pressure ulcers that can potentially lead to re-amputation, among other serious\"\" complications. Therefore, the long-term vision is to monitor, understand, and prevent, in real-time, conditions that could cause pr\"\"essure ulcers at the interface between the residual limb and socket prosthesis. As a step towards this goal, the objective of this o\"ne-year ONR project is tomonitor pressure distributions using fabric sensors lined along the interior surface of socket prostheses. The system utilizes strain-sensitive nanocomposites coupled with an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) conductivity distribution\" reconstruction technique. Piezoresistive nanocomposite sensors, unlike conventional transducers, are unique in that every location\" of the material is sensitive to strain (or pressure). One can then use EIT to map the 2D spatial conductivity (or resistivity) of t\"he film (which is pre-calibrated to pressure) to achieve distributed pressuremonitoring. In particular, three research tasks will b\"\"e conducted, and the scope includes: (1) designing and fabricating graphene nanosheet-based thin film strain sensors; (2) implementi\"ng a compressed sensing-based EIT algorithm; and (3) validating the system through a set of controlled laboratory tests. The project will culminate with laboratory validation tests of the distributed pressure sensor prototypes using advanced socket prostheses developed by LIM Innovations.less",

Particularly for large-area applications such ship hulls, complexity of implied system infrastructure can be impractical, and data can be worthless with attenuation and EMI pickup on long analog cables. The payoff of reliable real-time SHM would be the ability to detect/characterize in-situ damage for condition-based maintenance, thereby greatly reducing overall life-cycle costs. Metis Design Corporation (MDC) has demonstrated point-of-measurement datalogging and digital sensor-busing during prior Phase II SBIR work, which minimizes SHM infrastructure and EMI susceptibility. During the proposed STTR effort, MDC will further exploit this SHM architecture to satisfy Navy mission requirements. Phase I will have 2 main research thrusts: optimization of an impedance-based damage characterization method, and development of diagnostic visualization tools. UCSD will adapt their piezo-impedance method to be compatible with MDC hardware, optimize size/placement, and develop/calibrate diagnostic algorithms. MDC will facilitate the UCSD detection method with their mature SHM infrastructure, and provide a state-of-the-art graphical interface for visualization of diagnostic results in support of blind validation testing.

Elimination of individuals identified as threats is apparently of marginal long-term utility: other adversaries arise to replace fallen comrades. The conflict that is the global war on terror exists not only on an individual level but also on group and societal levels. The interplay of the dynamics among these levels is an important process to understand if we are to defeat terrorist agendas. A systems-theoretic approach to the social network dynamics of such groups provides an alternative to direct individual-based intervention, and there is significant potential in taking such an approach. We propose the development of cutting-edge algorithms for dynamic, stochastic games, integrating dynamic models of social networks with game-theoretic approaches to decision and our unique tools for handling uncertainty, intent estimation, and robustness to deception, for the improvement of decision-making within such contexts.less",

The approach has many advantages, when one terminal has limited power, space, weight, and a low cost as requirements. The major limitation for \u201cRetro-Comms\u201d has been that the modulator consumes too much power at higher modulation rates. What we propose is to reduce the power, size, weight and cost of the Retro-Modulator (RM) by improving the design of a deformable mirror, and its drive electronics. The RM device is largely capacitive, and the drive electronics and the modulation approach can be optimized so that the energy is recycled and dissipation is minimized. Further, we propose to use a co-located Photo-Voltaic converter to convert a part of the incident light to power the RM driver, and electronics. A further aspect of our design is that it can be deployed as a projectile. During Phase I we will design the circuitry, and test existing RM devices, capable of 100 kHz modulation, to improve the basis for designing higher performance devices. In Phase II, we will demonstrate the new design, and show modulation of beams at ~1500 kHz, with high beam quality retro-reflections. In Phase III we will do a full system demonstration.less",

Two dimensional arrays of ion damaged Josephson junctions will be designed and simulated to achieve a highly linear voltage response for unlocked operation. A variety of thin film YBCO HTS materials will be grown and patterned with ion damage junctions to investigate how the unique properties of each material affect the uniformity and ICRN properties of the junctions. Prototype broadband receiver elements will be investigated using HTS tapes. High quality YBCO tapes from STI will be patterned as coplanar waveguides and tested for their viability as a new interconnect technology. Two dimensional SQUID arrays with ion damage junctions will be fabricated on the HTS tapes to determine the feasibility of the tape structure for SQUID array devices. BENEFIT: This work will advance ion damage SQUID devices through enhanced engineering knowledge of materials selection to achieve the desired HTS device properties specific for receiver applications. SQUID devices directly transduce the magnetic flux threading the SQUID loop and the superconducting energy gap of typical HTS YBCO thin films are in the 100s of GHz to THz. Therefore SQUID devices are natively broadband and capable of operating at microwave frequencies. Simulations are anticipated to enable the engineering of high linearity SQUID arrays as required for unlocked operation. Ultimately, wideband receivers incorporating these SQUID arrays may be realized with much smaller weight and size than conventional systems.less",

Polymer composites are notorious for their tendency to microcrack in the matrix regions due to thermal cycling , fatigue loading and other situations where high stress concentrations exist at the fiber-matrix interface. Likewise stress concentrations at the adherend-adhesive interface in bonded joints can initiate cracking and lead to premature failure of the structure. Repair in these situations is costly and in many cases impossible due to limited access or risk of further degradation of the structure. A polymer with a built-in mechanism to repair cracks by restoring broken bonds is of great interest for numerous composite and adhesive applications to extend the service life and improve the safety of structural materials, electronic assemblies, storage tanks, ect.

        "abstract": "Future Exoatmospheric Interceptor Kill Vehicle (EKV) system upgrades and Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI) are expected to require nuclear radiation hardening of electro-optics subsystems. Alternative approaches include hardening of individual electronic components or external shielding of the subsystem using the structural elements. High atomic number materials, such as gold, tantalum, tungsten or steel, are candidates for structural radiation shielding. A lightweight, low cost, producible structural radiation shielding approach is needed to address this EKV and KEI nuclear radiation hardening issue. A low cost, producible composite manufacturing process with integral metallic foil liner materials and designs is an alternative lightweight and low cost approach. A program is proposed to develop and demonstrate a low cost, producible, lightweight composite structure with integral nuclear radiation shielding for EKV structures and electro-optic subsystem hardening using integrated graphite composites and metallic foil materials and design technologies (called \"InteGraFoil\", a trademark of Vanguard Composites). The foil will be a tantalum-aluminum hybrid material designed to gradual decrease radiation effects from nuclear events. The process for making these Metallic Intermetallic Laminates (MIL) foils has been patented by UCSD, our team partner for this project. The Phase I program will demonstrate feasibility of the InteGraFoil-MIL radiation shielding approach by integrating EKV composite structural components and radiation shielding metallic foils and fabricating test articles using the composite manufacturing processes and conducting subscale testing. In Phase II, the composite structure manufacturing process and InteGraFoil-MIL radiation shielding approach will be developed and demonstrated by fabrication of a full-size EKV composite structure and conduct of structural and simulated nuclear radiation ground tests demonstrating performance of the concept for representative EKV design environments.less",

However, scenario development is highly complex and involves a great deal of human effort and domain knowledge, discouraging the modification of existing scenarios to keep them current in an ever-changing threat environment. This problem is exacerbated when the scenario represents a combination of multiple data sources. The proposed research will show that the use of static models and companion correlation modules during scenario creation will reduce the complexity of scenario development and reduce the domain knowledge required. Static models can be devised to encapsulate domain knowledge for a particular data source, and correlation can be used to fuse the output from each static model to produce a cohesive scenario. To enable autonomic generation and regeneration of multi-source scenarios, the proposed research will also address service composibility and data heterogeneity among the participating static models and correlation modules. Finally, the proposed research will investigate human-computer interfaces for guiding the scenario developer through the autonomic process.less",

        "abstract": "The Air Force has expressed a need for reconfigurable cellular electronic and photonic arrays and their great potential in enabling the direct implementation of complex systems as software-defined emulations, configuring pre-built logic, and other optical processing or transmission functions. Our proposal addresses the need for integration of the universal logic cells and the reconfigurable interconnection matrix. The technology we propose will enable the photonic integrated circuit (IC) work is as flexible as its electronic counterparts such as the field programmable gate array (FPGA) IC. In particular, we propose to design and fabricate a universal logic cell formed by coupling the active micro-ring resonator with a Y-junction splitter. The gain and phase condition of the micro-ring will be controlled by an external voltage and optical probe signal so that the logic cell will perform in multiple states. The logic cell array will be connected by the reconfigurable optical interconnection matrix so that even more complicated functions can be realized. In Phase I, we propose to design, process, and demonstrate an electro-optical AND logic gate with two logic cells connected by photonic crystal interconnection waveguides. BENEFIT: Our proposed reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit (RPIC) will directly benefit Air Force warfighting systems due to its potentially pervasive morphability. The RPIC will reduce the development cost of complicated optical transmission or processing units since its basic structure is based on universal logic cells and a reconfigurable interconnection matrix that can be easily reconfigured according to real-time needs. It will also increase the agility of the fighting system due to its flexibly electrical and optical control methods. Due to its compact size and light weight, our RPIC can be easily integrated into airborne control or communication systems in the military aircrafts.   The RPIC also benefits other military applications such as the secure command and communication systems in a battlefield where the communication methods need real time reconfigured to avoid the hostile detections. The RPIC also increases the survivability of the war systems since they can be reconfigured to replace the damaged units.  The RPICs also have extensive civilian commercial applications. In scientific research applications, they can be used for conceptual validation of certain optical functions.  In communication systems, they can act as a programmable and reconfigurable optical logic unit or switching unit which can increase the system flexibility and reliability and help to build self-curable networks.)less",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project is the development of effective signal processing and circuits for high power amplifiers and transmitter modules for DoD wireless communication airborne and ground systems. Future base stations require wide bandwidth, high power, high voltage, wide dynamic range, excellent linearity, and high power efficiency. This research is critical to airborne and ground base station applications used for both mobile voice communication links and higher data rate multi-media mobile data communication links. Such systems have high bandwidth efficiency stemming from complex modulation and wide spreading bandwidth, but as a consequence must employ high dynamic range, high bandwidth amplifiers. The amplifiers must also have low power consumption, which dictates operation in saturation for peak efficiency. These requirements oppose each other, and require advanced approaches to realize improved performance.BENEFITS: This research has strategic relevance for today's wireless communication industry. In order to insure electromagnetic compatibility of the shared radio spectrum, the DoD must enforce strict limitations on both RF power and RF bandwidth. The military is then forced to make maximum use of the permitted power and spectrum for capacity, coverage, and quality of service. Hence, high linearity with complex modulation schemes must be employed at the power amplifier. Both high linearity requirements and next generation modulation schemes yield high power RF amplifiers with only 8% to 16% power efficiency using today's technology. One of the goals of this research is to improve high power RF amplifier efficiency to over 50% in next generation system. A multi-band frequency and multi-sector ground based Naval radio base station consumes 4000W to 5000W of power from its -48V DC power input. More than half of this power is consumed by the RF high power amplifiers. The RF power amplifiers are also the least reliable component in the base station due to the high operating temperatures created by their high heat dissipation. Another 4000 to 5000W is consumed by the AC to DC power system and air conditioning system. Furthermore, large banks of lead-acid batteries are used to back up the system. The proposed research could result in greater 50% reduction in heat produced by the base station. Consequently, focusing on the power amplifier will reduce power consumption, improve reliability, reduce system cost, reduce battery count, and reduce size and weight for the entire radio base station. The goal of this program - developing breakthrough performance improvement in high power amplifiers for the wireless communication systems - will benefit the E2 Advanced Hawkeye - and more generally the NAVAIR telecommunication sector.less",

As a result, cryptologic technicians and analysts often must manually derive a signal's features and match those features to an emitter class. Due to the large volumes of collected data that must be sorted through, it is challenging to find those signals that may be of tactical importance in a timely fashion. With the reduction in operational billets, the development of an automated, advanced feature measurement capability has become a necessity. KAB proposes the development of the Automated RF Measurement Module (ARMM), which supports advanced emitter identification capabilities by providing automated feature measurements for both traditional and modern communication technologies. ARMM will employ digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms to support advanced feature measurement, and an open architecture will facilitate the addition or modification of algorithms as new technologies emerge. ARMM will be a service-oriented capability, supported by an open application programming interface (API) to allow any number of client applications to utilize the service. ARMM will be highly portable, enabling it to run on a number of target platforms on both local and wide area networks.less",

Optical delivery of RF signals is an increasingly important topic for applications including RF antenna remoting, signal routing, CATV, wireless repeaters and tunnels, in-building coverage, and surveillance and reconnaissance. Communication systems using optical signals are a common approach for both military and commercial applications and advancements made for one application form the foundation for advancements in another application. In recent months, Archcom has recently received a number of requests from a variety of customers regarding high current handling, high linearity photodetectors for a few of the aforementioned applications. These requests were targeting the 20GHz and 40GHz bands. Our existing product at 50GHz was optimized for digital communication systems where achieving a high responsivity/bandwidth product was the primary design goal to create a receiver with the highest sensitivity possible.

For instance, multifunctional wearable sensor platforms currently being developed for the Navy can be integrated with the Vicon motioncapture data to assemble sophisticated, multi-scale, Digital Twins of warfighters and subjects during training and exercise. Not only will global biomechanics features be extracted (e.g., for gait analysis), but local joint and muscle movements will also be quantified. The fusion of these multiscaledata streams to directly build state-of-the-art, image-based, multi-scale bio-physical models will establish a new platform for which warfighter performance assessment and prehabilitation can be achieved.

        "abstract": "Co-site interference is a common source of jamming aboard naval vessels where several high power systems such as radars and electronic warfare equipment are co-located on same mast or in close vicinity of communication systems. High power transmissions from these systems act as local source of jamming and can be disruptive to the function of the communication radios also operating in the same environment. A hardware approach for mitigating the effects of co-site interference is to equip the nearby receivers with bandstop filters that are capable of suppressing these jammers. Due to the wide frequency range and dynamic nature of the interference, these bandstop filters must be tunable in a wide frequency range and have an adjustable bandwidth and attenuation. Furthermore, they must be highly linear and capable of withstanding large levels of RF power. Existing tunable filter technologies are generally lacking in both respects. The objective of this STTR project is to develop a wideband fully tunable bandpass filter solution to address this need. Freeform Wave Technology, LLC, and University of California, San Diego, have teamed up to develop a new generation of MEMS based bandstop filters that are expected to reach unprecedented levels of RF performance, tunability, and power handling. High reliability MEMS varactors developed by UCSD will be the key enabling technology in these filters.less",

In ambient noise studies, the ability to resolve a wavefield is proportional to its time-bandwidth (TB) product. In a dynamic environment such as in the atmosphere or ocean, the nature of the impinging wave field is changing rapidly so that only short time segments can be used to model the ambient wave field thereby reducing the TB product. One way to counter the effect of a reduced time window is to increase the bandwidth of measurement. Our approach is to broaden the frequency spectrum used to characterize diffusive noise fields in dynamic environments by addition of Intensity Level Differences (ILD) caused by diffraction around a shadowing object to the more commonly used interferometric phase delay methods. Diffraction around a shadowing object can create acoustic bright spots that are easily detected. As an experimental test, we will use ambient noise data from existing infrasonic arrays and characterize the dynamic wavefield using passive interferometry and spatial gradiometry techniques. For spatial gradient techniques, the required sensor footprint is smaller and the wavefield can be mapped at higher resolution at closer ranges.less",

Commercially available imaging sensors use Si material for detecting visible spectrum, GaN material system for UV spectrum detection, and InP material system for near infrared (IR) spectrum detection. A goal in Phase-I program is to carry on research and development of ZnO nanowires growth process over wide area of substrate and also design, fabricate, and testing the single detector having wide spectral response, extending from UV-VIS-Near IR having higher quantum efficiency > 80% and fast response (GHz ranges) for showing its benefits over conventional Si-based CMOS sensor. Recognizing the vast application potential of Banpil\u2019s bolometer, several industrial partners have expressed strong interest in commercializing this technology. In Phase II, Banpil will work with several leading night vision companies who expressed strong interest on proposed multispectral image sensor, as a part of commercialization of the high sensitivity and fast response image sensor technology integrateable to Si-CMOS circuit.less",

Our proposed armor is structured around AgileZorb\u2122 a revolutionary nanotechnology-based blast energy absorbing material recently shown by the Navy to reduce transmitted blast pressures by 75% to 95% and to be orders of magnitude faster than conventional materials. The remainder of the structure consists of high hardness steel, flame resistant Kevlar\u00ae, and Nomex\u00ae honeycomb filled with the AgileZorb. The steel begins fragmenting the projectiles and protects against environmental elements. The Kevlar\u00ae layers provide spall and additional fragment and projectile barriers in addition to excellent flame resistance. The combined layers provide protection against the primary shock front (a primary cause of Traumatic Brain and Blast Lung injury), the tertiary blast wind and ballistic penetration.less",

Although considerable progress has been made in balancing the distribution of control authority between humans (H) and machines (M), there continues to be a limited understanding of the effects of differences in covert (internal) states between humans and machines on this control relationship and system performance. Covert states are usually associated at different levels of uncertainty stemming from the fact that the human mind, machine sensing, and interactive environments are nonstationary in nature. However, current tools for monitoring the relationship between system performance and covert states lack systematic, efficient, and interpretable mechanisms. These problems result in a lack of reliable decision-making in HMT.

Other simulation models will incorporate hypothetical enhancements to 802.11 hardware to provide more flexibility to control the PHY layer transmission parameters and more information about PHY layer parameters when a packet is received.

        "abstract": "We propose to use the finite element technique to model propagation of acoustics waves in a realistic shallow water (10-100 m) environment in the presence of man-made or natural targets. Such modeling accuracy is paramount in detection and classification of underwater targets. Currently available models make simplifying assumptions in modeling both scattering and propagation. Targets are usually modeled as non-penetrable (rigid) or having simple shapes. In most cases, simple scattering models such as the Kirchhoff approximation is used to compute the scattered field. The existing propagation models are also unable to accurately model a realistic ocean environment. For instance, there is no propagation model that can accurately compute propagation in a range-dependent ocean overlying an elastic bottom. These models cannot provide the accuracy that is needed for use in detection and classification of underwater targets. To properly account for the full physics of the problem, propagation and scattering should be solved as a single boundary value problem. Our approach will consist of three stages: in stage 1, we will use the finite element technique in 2-D to propagate the acoustic field to the target, in stage 2, we will use the finite element technique in 3-D to compute the scattered field, and in stage 3, we will use the finite element technique in 2-D to propagate the scattered field to the receiver. For shorter ranges and/or lower frequencies it may be possible to solve the whole problem in 3-D as a single boundary value problem. In Phase 1 of this effort, we will demonstrate the capability of our proposed approach to model scattering from a simple elastic target in a shallow water environment overlying an elastic bottom. In this phase, we will solve this problem for a source to target separation of approximately 1000 wavelengths. In Phase 2, we will extend the capability of our approach to model the problem for a source to target separation of approximately 10,000 wavelengths, and for arbitrary man-made or natural targets. The novelty of our approach is the use of the finite element method in propagation modeling, which has only become possible with advances in computer speed along with progress in modern finite element techniques.less",

At this point in time, sixteen element arrays of coupled oscillators have not been demonstrated in silicon integrated circuits. This proposal recognizes several implementation challenges to wide angle beam steering using coupled oscillators including managing oscillator mismatches, demonstrating low oscillator phase noise, and avoiding undesirable oscillator coupling through the substrate and packaging.

        "abstract": "Combat readiness, retention on duty, and rapid return to service post-injury are three essential pillars that support U.S. military,capabilities and lethality while ensuring overmatch against adversarial forces. Yet, musculoskeletal ,re incurred during physical training, tactical training, in service, or recreational activities although non-life-threatening, are,operations to reliably assess warfighter physical function, performance, and MSK health in real-time. One approach that enables the,holistic monitoring of warfighter MSK health and performance is through the use of distributed wearable skin-strain sensors. The PI,and his team, through ONR funding, has successfully developed and validateda disposable, self-adhesive, elastic, fabric-based, senso,r that can be affixed practically anywhere on the body to measure distributed skin-strains. The approach was to deposit strain-sensi,tive graphene nanosheet (GNS) nanocomposite strain sensors onto self-adhesive kinesiology tape. GNS thin films were designed to exhi,bit high strain sensitivity, repeatability, and minimal measurement drift compared to similar designs based on other nanomaterials.,This design results in a unidirectionally stretchable wearable sensor, termed Motion Tape, which can directly measure skin-strains, during movement. Motion Tapes sensing performance has been extensively characterized in the laboratory, and human subject validati,on tests have been performed with participants wearing Motion Tape on the biceps, triceps, shoulders, wrist, finger, back, knee, ank,le, foot, calves, gluteal, and leg. Despite these successes, repeatable, automated, and scalable manufacturing methods need to be de,vised to fabricateMotion Tapes (or other nanocomposite wearables) quickly, at low cost, and with consistent sensing properties. It i,s crucial to bridge this technology gap before Motion Tape and other thin-film-based wearables could be effectively translated to th,e commercial sector for military and civilian use.Acquisition of the Fujifilm Dimatrix Materials DMP-2850 multi-material printer sys,tem will directly enhance ongoing and planned ONR research projects on developing next-generation wearable sensors for warfighter pe,rformance monitoring. In particular, the DMP-2850 provides a powerful platform for precision printing of materials, jetting analysis,, and fluid development for, specifically, research and development work in academia and industry. The DMP-2850 employs drop-on-dema,nd piezoelectric inkjet technology, which allows one to deposit a diverse range of fluid materials onto a variety of substrates. The, printer also offers a plethora of useful features that increase the accuracy and precision of the print. Overall, the DMP-2850 is a, cost-effective, easy-to-use, precision materials deposition system that enables scalable manufacturing of novel materials and nanoc,omposites, such as Motion Tape. The printer will address manufacturing issues of novel nanocomposite wearable sensors and help advan,ce the technology readiness level of Motion Tape for field testing, clinical studies, and deployment. The printer also enables the P,I to investigate other materials and more sophisticated sensing modalities while creating an entirely new array of possible future r,esearch opportunities and collaborations, especially with relevant Department of Defense (DoD) partners nationwide. Availability of,such a system in a university setting also strongly positions the PI to develop new educational content and hands-on laboratory modu,les that introduce students to inkjet-based nanocomposite manufacturing technologies.less",

        "abstract": "lanning is a pervasive problem in artificial intelligence, and with perception together form the core of artificial intelligence. Planning involves considering the sequence of actions of agent(s) in an environment over a time horizon that maximizes some long-term objective. Because planning must consider the consequences of actions many steps in the future, the possible futures to search for good solutions can quickly explode in number to millions and beyond, resulting in long wait times for good solutions. While solutions to static problems can be solved and saved offline and referenced online in order to overcome the delay in processing a plan, this practice falls apart for non-static scenarios or where information is gathered online. This project investigates a fundamentally new approach to decision making (planning) via imitation learning. The approach involves imprinting the input-output behaviors of optimal solvers and experts (oracles), into neural networks. The approach hypothesizes that by training a function approximator such as a neural network to mimic prior demonstrations from the oracle, we can learn embeddings of the problem as well as the oracles\u00d5 solutions and reproduce optimal solutions across both old and new problem instances. This can be done with transformatively lowered speed and computational complexity because the problem has fundamentally changed from an online search problem in high-dimensional spaces to an offline regression problem with an online line prediction that can be solved with smaller, finite computation. This idea of producing behaviors using a neural embedding was motivated by looking at how Nature encodes intelligence: the human and animal brain generates behaviors in complex dynamic environments using instinct, especially in environments that are similar to those encountered before, and not by running internal tree-search algorithms or approximate dynamic programs on-the-fly. The following proposal investigates three different thrusts: Research Thrust 1: Oracle networks for discrete graph planning: Here we will describe the problem of imitating a combinatorial optimization solver. We approach setting up discrete oracle networks to be problem-size-invariant by defining both a recurrent latent embedding function for tasks, defined by discrete sub-tasks in a graphical form. Research Thrust 2: Hierarchical planning using oracle imitation: We propose learning a nested hierarchical planner via oracle imitation. We contrast the work to traditional hierarchical planning in that we introduce composition as a technique that can solve problems that require a specific combination of sequential tasks and underlying motion primitives. Research Thrust 3: Learning-to-learn oracle networks: New problem instances always pose a challenge for neural networks to learn, as many consider new problem instances to be data-hungry to adapt to. We will investigate a meta-oracle approach, which allows oracle networks to adapt to new problem instances and environments with as few as one example from the oracle. The learned networks will be physically demonstrated on an embedded solution on off-the-shelf embedded computer hardware to show off our claimed advantages in power-limited mobile robots. This cloud-disconnected, on-board emphasis can directly address the ever-relevant challenges of autonomous agents to make decisions in communications-compromised scenarios.less",

Center-of-mass (COM) dynamics of many running organisms across 5-orders of magnitude in mass exhibit similar bouncy COM behavior consistent with a spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). However, we have very little understanding whether SLIP running dynamics are employed by low-mass runners such as small arthropods. This STIR will initiate funding towards identification of the dynamics of low-mass legged locomotion in biological and microrobotic systems. This STIR will fund development of a high-bandwidth micro-newton force sensor to measure the instantaneous ground reaction forces during high speed running of milligram and sub-milligram legged insects. We will use this force sensor coupled with a high-speed and multiple view imaging system to identify the running dynamics and kinematics of Argentine ant workers common to Southern California. Informed understanding of low-mass legged locomotion from this STIR will enable follow-up design and development of milligram scale legged microrobots that will be supported by PI Gravish. It is understood that any developmental items and specially designed parts, components, accessories and attachments fabricated under any Department of Defense award resulting from this proposal are being developed for civil and potential military applications.

Acoustic communication devices exist that can transmit data through the water, such that an insitu instrument at depth can be interrogated remotely from a ship at the surface without physically recovering the instrumentation. The principal investigators are presently using this technology in one ONR-funded project and three others. Their single ship-side unit of the existing system is facing technical obsolescence issues as well as scheduling conflicts between the needs of the multiple projects. Procurement of another system, comprised of both a ship-side unit with firmware upgrades to resolve the technical incompatibilities and a single matching underwater unit, will eliminate risk to the ONR project as well as future work during the expected instrument life of 10 years. This will enhance the ONR work by reducing data gaps and accelerating access to complete data from deployed instrumentation. In addition, a new teaching opportunity in the field of acoustics will be opened up for oceanography students by making the unit available for an existing class taught by the principal investigators, where students go out to sea on a research vessel for hands-on research.less",

        "abstract": "Traumatic injury often necessitates warfighters to undergo limb amputations, including more than 1,600 military personnel who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. In order to help the warfighter to regain lost functionality, they are often fitted with socket prostheses. However, sockets today utilize rigid materials that are directlyfitted over the residual stump, which can cause discomfort as well as painful and expensive-to treat complications such as pressure ulcers. Emerging developments in smart sockets not only aim to replace conventional hard sockets with more compliant materials for better fit, but they are alsofitted with a suite of sensors for monitoring socket performance and amputee health. In order to enable pressure ulcer monitoring as part of these next-generation socket prostheses, the objective of this project is to advance densely distributed pressure sensing. This project builds on previouswork on Nano composite-based fabric sensors, where densely distributed pressure sensing was successfully validated using an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) measurement scheme and algorithm. The fabric sensor can be lined within the interior of the socket and only interrogated at its boundaries to provide full-field pressure distribution monitoring capabilities. Therefore, threeresearch tasks will be conducted during this one-year ONR project. First, the sensing performance (i.e., sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy) of these nanocomposite sensing liners will be characterized and optimized by tuning the sensing element (material) to detect limit states that correspond to conditions likely to induce pressure ulcers in amputees. Second, near-real-timepressure mapping will be achieved by considering both hardware and ERT algorithm enhancements. Finally, the system will be integrated with LIM Innovations??? smart socket prosthesis and validated in the laboratory. The vision is that advancing the technology readiness level of the proposed smart socket prosthesis sensing liners will improve pressure ulcer monitoringand prevention capabilities while facilitating transition of this technology to warfighter useless",

We also report the formation of perfect/truncated nanocubes through the dual-effects of carbide diluent and transition metal doping. The TaC:Ni system demonstrated ~80% of morphological modification among the particles evaluated. The governing mechanisms for Ni to have significant impact on morphological modification include (1) the selective absorption of Ni atoms onto {100} surfaces and (2) the molten Ni acts as diluent for carbon dissolution and diffusion. The effectiveness of the carbide diluent is attributed to its lowering of the maximum combustion temperature during reaction, which prevents particle surfaces from roughening and rounding, promoting exposure of facets.less",

The workshops typically showcase a particular species, and there is a public dataset that attendees are encouraged to analyze, with a comparison of results presented during the workshop. The first workshop focused on right whales (Eubalaena spp.), and resulted in the publication of a special issue of Canadian Acoustics (2004) devoted to peer-reviewed papers from the workshop.

It was the second in a series that began as a conference on Nanoscience held at Northwestern University in August of 2011, which was originally established to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Prof. Chad A. Mirkin\u00d5s Lab at Northwestern. That event had ~100 participants and consisted of 20 lectures from academic and industry leaders in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Due to the overwhelming response to the high-quality talks and the fruitful exchange of ideas between academic and high-tech industry, the organizing committee decided to establish this event as a series, held every five years. The plan is to hold a meeting at Northwestern, at the International Institute for Nanotechnology, and then five years later, hold the meeting at a location in Asia. Therefore, we chose Hong Kong as the first Asian location of the conference. In the future we anticipate Singapore and South Korea as locations. In 2016 the Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) and the Department of Applied Physics (AP) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University hosted the 2nd event of this series, with the theme \u00d2Young Giants of Nanoscience\u00d3. This international conference gathered some of the very best young scientists from across Asia and the United States to present their state-of-the-art findings. The goals included the building up of close ties and relationships that can form a longstanding platform for the Asia-Pacific community of nanoscientists. We believe such efforts will lead to future collaborations, and will provide a valuable learning opportunity for local research students in Hong Kong and potentially students and postdoctoral fellows visiting from across the world.less",

To support informed decision making and resilient planning, the DoD Regional Sea Level (DRSL) database provides regionalized sea level change scenarios for three future time horizons to assess vulnerability and risks at DoD sites worldwide. With the recent release of more detailed projections of extreme water levels (Fox-Kember et al. 2021, Garner et al. 2021, Sweet et al. 2022), and with the development of advanced methods for defining extreme water level (EWL) probabilities, the modeling and analysis study will result in recommendations for DRSL updates and expansions for consideration by the Coastal Assessment Regional Scenario Working Group. Two methods for projecting EWL using the TESLA model (Marra et al. 2022) and global models of storm surge and waves forced by global climate model outputs, will be compared at four total test sites, two in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific, for the purpose of improving extreme event assessments. Tools to incorporate wave effects in extreme sea levels will be demonstrated at the test sites. Mean sea level projections at sites that can be added to the Real Property Asset Database and a methodology for updating vertical land motion (VLM) rates will be developed.less",
