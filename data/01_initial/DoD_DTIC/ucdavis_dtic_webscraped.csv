0,A Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Approach to Understanding Event Representation and Episodic Memory,United States Department of the Navy,to Charan Ranganath,"A Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Approach to Understanding Event Representation and Episodic Memory~ (Charan Ranganath, PI) to"""" ONR MURI program, Topic 12 ~ Event Representation and Episodic Memory. Total costs are estimated at $7,500,000.00 over 5 years with"""" 3-year base period of $4,500,000 and 2-year option period of $3,000,000. Memory for specific events (~episodic memory~) and knowl""edge accrued across multiple events (~event schemas~) play powerful roles in human cognition. Neuroscience research has strongly lin""ked these abilities to interactions between the hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and a posterior medial (PM) neo""cortical network. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the neural processes that support representation of event schemas and episodic memory could be of enormous significance to basic neuroscience. Achieving this goal would have significant implications for DOD"" capabilities, such as the development of autonomous systems capable of rapid extraction of information about temporal and spatial r""""elations, causality, and intentionality from complex data streams. At present, however, there is insufficient knowledge about how ev""""ents are segmented, learned, and retrieved in the human brain, and the field lacks an appropriate computational framework to explain"""" existing data. To address these challenges, we propose an integrative computational cognitive neuroscience approach to understandin""g event representation and episodic memory.The centerpiece of this project is an innovative neurocomputational framework called St""ructured Event Memory (SEM). SEM integrates the strengths of three different, but related, approaches~Latent Cause Models, Event Seg""""mentation Theory, and the Complementary Learning Systems Model~to explain how interactions between the hippocampus, vmPFC, and PM ne""""twork support event representation and episodic memory. The architecture of SEM is scalable, it is meaningfully tied to neural mecha""""nisms, and it provides a principled and parsimonious account of a diverse range of processes, including: schema formation, event seg""""mentation, context in memory and language, episodic memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and updating, prediction, and mental"""" simulation. SEM is especially innovative in that it is designed to learn about the structure of the world, in terms of temporal, ca""""usal, and situational relationships within an event, and in terms of the characteristic transitions between different kinds of event""""s. Building on our initial work, we will accomplish the following Tasks: (1) Develop a computational model of event representation a""""nd episodic memory. (S. Gershman, Harvard), (2) Specify the neural mechanisms that support learning and application of semantic know""""ledge about events. (K. Norman, U. Hasson, Princeton), (3) Specify how corticohippocampal interactions support episodic memory retri""""eval and consolidation. (C. Ranganath, UC Davis), (4) Specify the cognitive and neural causes and consequences of event segmentation"""" (J. Zacks, Washington University), & (5) Determine how broadband and oscillatory neural activity contributes to event segmentation"""" and episodic memory (Orrin Devinsky, NYU, in collaboration with all team members).By addressing fundamental questions about how e""""vent segmentation shapes the structure of semantic and episodic memory, and how the hippocampus interacts with neocortical networks,"""" the proposed empirical studies go well beyond the current state of the art. Moreover, by utilizing novel data-driven machine learni""""ng analysis approaches and theory-driven forward modeling of neuroimaging and electrocorticography data, every study in this project"""" will break new methodological ground. At the end of the five-year period, we will deliver an integrated computational architecture"""" that can translate in any direction between complex narrative or video stimuli, real-time brain activity patterns, and meaningful cless","7,500,000",2017,2020
0,High-Power Multispectral Hemispherical Phased Array Beam Steering Subsystems Demonstrator,United States Department of the Navy,to S.J. Ben Yoo,"ABSTRACT: We propose to investigate and demonstrate an innovative high-power, multi-spectral, non-mechanical steering subsystem ena""bled by a combination of high-power MWIR and LWIR quantum cascade laser (QCL) and amplifier (QCA) arrays and a multi-spectral phase-array beam steering module on a single silicon platform. The proposed subsystem demonstrator (SSD) includes three spectral bands wit""h tunable wavelengths: MWIR1 (e.g. 3.4-3.8 micron), MWIR2 (e.g. 4.5-4.6 micron), and LWIR (e.g. 9.0-10.6 micron). At the onset of th""""e project, specific wavelengths within each band can be selected by the Sponsor. The proposed SSD driven by the control electronics"""" interfacing with the innovative active-matrix-array 3D photonic-electronic phase array (3D PEPA) allows the pointing, steering, and"""" tracking of a remote object with all three wavelength bands with high beam quality M2 below 1.3, power (above 30 Watts of combined"""" power), and stability. The high-resolution and high-precision 3D PEPA with integrated thin-film transistors (TFT) realized on CMOS-""compatible fabrication processes allow sidelobe-free and hemispheric (180 degree total-field-of-view in all directions) beam steering by independent matrix control of pixels. The SSD realized on a single silicon platform with equal-path lengths allows agile tuning of the emission wavelengths of QCLs while supporting accurate and stable pointing under challenging ambient and vibration condition""s. The proposed new capability addresses increased combat effectiveness for all aerial vehicles, manned and unmanned, by providing a"""" conformal optical system required for search, track, dazzle, and jam. Additionally, this new technology addresses naval capability"""" to control or to attack multi EW spectrum with rapid, accurate, and agile point-and-steer of multi EW spectrum laser beams. The pro""posed project will develop very compact phased array optical beam steering technologies that will allow coherent energy spanning multiple bands of the MWIR and LWIR spectrum to be directed in a low divergence beam with minimal or no side lobes over an angular rang""e coveringa complete hemisphere. The proposed phase array beam steering technology covers very fast (ms), small (28 cc), and emits"" high optical power levels (above 30 W total combined power). We will first test the prototyped SSD in the emulated lab environment at a collaborating laboratory with temperature variations and vibrations applied to the SSD. The laboratory prototype will be adapted into existing MWIR active sensing system used for surface and air antisubmarine warfare (ASW) applications. To minimize any di""stortions to the launched beam due toatmospheric effects and ensure the desired underwater acoustic EA effects can be generated, th""""e prototype will be initially tested from a surface ship. Once the desired acoustic EA effects are demonstrated, the prototype will"" be incorporated into a flight-ruggedized package and field tested in realistic maritime environment on board a rotary wing platform. The warfighter payoffs the proposed project includes (a) increased combat effectiveness for all manned or unmanned aerial vehi""cles or surface ships by providing a conformal optical system required for EA (search, track, dazzle, and jam) in such applications"""" as Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) or Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM), counter-ISR against MWIR/LWIR passive or active i""maging; as well as in active (acoustic) sensing in air ASW applications; (b)enhances Naval capability to control or to attack multi""-EW spectrum with rapid, accurate, and agile point-and-steer of multi-EW spectrum laser beams; (c) expands mission capabilities to s""""imultaneous access to multiple spectral bands, extends range and time over target, increases platform survivability, supports faster"""" response to targets, reduces sensitivity to vibrations andtemperature variations.less","3,000,000",2017,2021

0,Glycan Modulation of Pharmaceutical Glycoproteins by In Vitro Enzymatic Approaches,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to KarenAnn McDonald,"Many therapeutic proteins are glycoproteins which are proteins that have chains of sugars (i.e. glycans) attached to them at specific sites in a process known as glycosylation. The structure and distribution of glycans on pharmaceutical glycoproteins have a dramatic effect on their efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and stability. In this project, therapeutic glycoproteins that are known to act as protective bioscavengers against chemical and biological toxins are produced recombinantly in plant-based production systems. Plant cells, as higher eukaryotes, can glycosylate proteins and the initial steps are identical between humans and plants. In addition, they do not harbor or propagate mammalian pathogens. Furthermore, plants can be cultured in mass scales. They are ideal expression systems for the low-cost and large-scale production of glycoproteins that are important for counteracting weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical and biological agents. The goals of this project are to develop novel methods for the production of two bioscavenger glycoproteins, human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), a bioscavenger for organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents, and a chimeric anthrax antitoxin (CGM2-Fc), with improved efficacy against their binding targets by altering the glycan structures that are attached to the proteins. BuChE is produced in transgenic rice cell culture bioreactors and CGM2-Fc is produced transiently in tobacco plants in an indoor facility. Following production and purification of the bioscavengers, advanced analytical tools (liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) are used to determine precise glycan structures at each site. In vitro enzymatic processes are then used to modify the glycan structures, while computer modeling using atomistic molecular dynamic simulations and coarse grain modeling approaches predicts the effects of glycan structures on glycoprotein structure and target binding energy and is used to direct the glycan modification studies. Finally, experimental studies are used to test the efficacy of the various therapeutic bioscavenger glycoforms (including target binding rate constants, dissociation rates, thermodynamic parameters of interaction, pharmacokinetics and challenge studies). Improved fundamental understanding of how the glycan structures impact binding efficiency for therapeutic bioscavengers will allow us to design protective bioscavengers with improved efficacy. This project will provide fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship of glycans on glycoprotein therapeutics, and supply technologies for large-scale production of glycoproteins in plants and in vitro enzymatic modification of glycans on glycoproteins. Improved therapeutics may be discovered and the approach is generalizable to other bioscavenger glycoproteins.less","2,917,016",2015,2020
0,Dynamic Cortico-Hippocampal Interactions for Flexible Goal-Driven Agents,United States Department of the Navy,to Randall O'Reilly,"How does the human brain enable us to flexibly adapt to novel situations, applying hard-won prior experience in ways that apply to new challenges? Current AI systems continue to fail at capturing this central feature of human intelligence. We propose to leverage our extensive understanding of the neural organization of the human brain to suggest novel solutions to thisperennial challenge, using a synergistic combination of biologically-based computational models and cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, including intracranial recordings and fMRI. Our approach involves four central hypotheses: 1) The brain learns and processes structure separate from content , along separate neural pathways. This enables abstract structural representations tobe flexibly recombined with novel content, while transferring structural inferences and implications to these novel domains. 2) Predictive learning can learn an abstract structural forward model of how events unfold over time (i.e., a situation model ), providing a biologically plausible mechanism for how the neural mechanisms that enable flexible behavior are generated. 3) The ability to direct behavior toward desired outcomes and goals requires the ability to reversethis model and figure out the actions required to achieve those goals. The hippocampus can help solve this problem by encoding the overarching situation model that led to a given outcome, and then later recalling that situation model for use as a plan to guide behavior toward that outcome, when it is desired again. This suggests a novel type of strategic control over hippocampalencoding and recall, and a critical role for episodic memory in enabling flexible human behavior. 4) The prefrontal cortex can robustly maintain abstract plans to guide behavior, based on representations learned through longer-timescale predictive learning. Each of these hypotheses has existing empirical and computational support, but this project is the first to put all of these elements together in a way that can finally make significant progress toward understandingflexible goal-driven human behavior.less","2,250,000",2020,2023

0,THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF N000141510033 Decoding and Enhancing Neural Mechanisms for Episodic Memory,United States Department of the Navy,to Charan Ranganath,"Research on learning and memory is fundamental to understanding cognition and directlyrelevant to the training of military personnel and to the diagnosis and rehabilitation of injuredsoldiers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of memory have identified acortico-hippocampal network that is critical for remembering past events. Recent evidenceindicates that regions in this network generate rhythmic electrophysiological oscillations in thetheta band (4-8 Hz), and that theta oscillations may be related to cognitive states that promotesuccessful memory retrieval. The objective of this project is to use three empirically motivatedmethods to manipulate theta activity and determine effects on memory and on recruitment ofbrain networks measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI. Rhythmic sensorystimulation (Aim 1), transcranial alternating current stimulation (Aim 2), and reward motivation(Aim 3) will be used to manipulate theta activity during memory retrieval tasks. EEG studies willdetermine how theta enhancement affects the magnitude and timing of theta activity duringmemory retrieval, and fMRI studies will determine effects on recruitment of the corticohippocampalnetwork. We will also use advanced multivariate analysis techniques to decodehow information about past episodes is represented in neural activity patterns and test whethertheta enhancement sharpens these representations. This project will advance basic science bydirectly connecting neural oscillations, which are currently poorly understood, to specificcognitive processes and to activity in a cortico-hippocampal network that is thought to play acrucial role in episodic memory. Moreover, the proposed studies can lead to the development ofnovel biomarkers for memory function and dysfunction (e.g., to assess service-connectedcognitive impairment) and of systems for accelerating learning (e.g., in training situations) andrehabilitating memory (e.g., in injured soldiers).

Validated components such as the landing parachute, folding wing mechanism, and autopilot control system will undergo integrated flight-testing. Logistic Gliders will provide a considerable cost share to support the flight tests. The LG-X glider system is a low-cost, single-use, autonomous, glider-based naval Ship to Objective Mission (STOM) logistic resupply system. An amphibious ships Air Combat Element can launch 50 gliders an hour because the MV-22 and CH-53 can carry multiple gliders simultaneously. Multiple gliders can also be carried by the KC-130, C-17, and CH-47. The LG-X glider is capable of improving throughput and throughput/cost, increasing mission radius, and reducing cost/distance while operating in time constrained scenarios and in all-weather environments without requiring air base infrastructures or air superiority. The LG-X glider can deliver sea-based supplies to several groups of Marines located at widely separated points of need without further burdening the units or telegraphing their location.

0,Engines of Adaptation: Self-Programming via Emergent Thermodynamic Machines,United States Department of the Army,to James Crutchfield,"Research Problem: Remarkably robust and intelligent systems operate across the tremendous time and length scales of the natural world. What is common in the behaviors spanning these immense scales is what one can call adaptive emergent intrinsic computation. These systemsÕ functioning relies on a kind of self-programmingÑspontaneously-generated ex- tended patterns of control and self-monitoring. Our goal is to experimentally demonstrate and theoretically predict this kind of emergent adaptive computation. Technical approach: We take a particularly novel approach that harnesses recent advances in nonlinear physics, nanoscale thermodynamics, genetic engineering, and high-performance computing. Recent remarkable progress in these arenas and our teamÕs deep expertise with them suggests that our attack on the challenge of adaptive emergent intrinsic computation is likely to succeed, where others have fallen short. To guide and ground theoretical developments we will use four unique experimental platforms, two natural and two engineered, coupled with large-scale simulations to quantitatively bridge between theory and experiment. Anticipated Outcomes: In light of recent foundational progress we anticipate the following results: (i) information principles of pattern formation in large-scale complex systems, (ii) design, prediction, and monitoring of a novel class of spatial, networked information engines; (iii) thermodynamics of adaptation that lays out the trade-offs between cognitive processing and energetics, and (iv) identifying and using the natural programmability of emergent patterns. Impact on DoD Capabilities: By implementing networks of information engines connected in various topologies we will explore the principles driving the emergence of system organizations that support computation and adaptation. Success will introduce radically new and functional platforms that exploit intelligent thermodynamically-embedded information processing in a way that can be programmed to generate emergent functioning in distributed complex systems. Such capabilities will impact many DoD applications from endowing materials with computationally advanced sense-response capabilities and directing the flow of energy and entropy to and from storage devices to porting such programmable patterns to information processing on radically smaller spatial and faster temporal scales and a first-principles understanding of adaptive behavior in autonomous systems.less","1,499,973",2020,2023

0,UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION AND PROCESSING OPTIMIZATION FOR UHTC MANUFACTURING THROUGH AN ICME FRAMEWORK,United States Air Force,to SCOTT MCCORMACK,"Standard ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC) manufacturing creates components with large differences in properties due to variability in microstructural 'critical flaw' distributions. Critical flaws can be any irregularity in a component, such as a secondary phase, inclusion, crack, pore etc. This is problematic when designing reproducible UHTC components for Mach 6 hypersonic applications. The goal of this project is to build probabilistic characterization of processing-structure-properties (PSP) parameters and link them at each stage of UHTC processing in a way that allows for uncertainty propagation. This methodology has not been performed in the past due to the complex interrelations of UHTC PSP parameters that need to be deconvoluted. Thus, multi-fidelity PSP database development and effective integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) combined with statistical modeling is key to minimize uncertainty during UHTC manufacturing. This approach will consist of three key integrated thrusts- Thrust I- Manufacturing and rapid materials characterization- to populate a multi-fidelity PSP database using a combination of lower-fidelity in-lab experiments and modeling along with higher-fidelity synchrotron 3-D microstructural characterization experiments. Thrust II- Uncertainty quantification- to develop a PSP-ICME database in tandem with multi-fidelity statistical modeling using a Bayesian neural network approach. Thrust III- Validation of the multi-fidelity model- to verify that the statistical model can reduce uncertainty in UHTC manufacturing in terms of properties and microstructural flaws.

0,Deep Predictive Learning in Vision,United States Department of the Navy,to Randall O'Reilly,"Research problem: Our existing research has identified powerful predictive learning mechanisms that enable our biologically-based computational models to learn invariant object representations in a purely self-organizing manner, without requiring the massive sets of hand-labeled images that standard deep neural networks are critically dependent upon. These mechanisms are based directly upon the biology of the primate visual system, and make sense of a wide range of data at many different levels of analysis. However, our existing models were developed using simplified visual inputs, and we propose here to scale them up to handle large numbers of realistic 3D objects, ultimately with multiple objects at a time interacting with each other.Technical approach: Predictive learning requires movie-like animated scenes, where the model is constantly predicting what will happen next, and learning from the difference between what actually does happen and the prediction. According to our theory, this prediction-outcome learning cycle occurs every 100 msec (10 Hz, i.e, the alpha rhythm). Thus, massive amounts of predictive learning can occur every day, providing the constraints to shape powerful internal generative, predictive models of the world. We propose to render large numbers of systematically generated scenes involving 3D objects moving with realistic physics, to train our models on increasingly complex and realistic environments. Ultimately, our models should be able to learn from real movies and video footage, and apply their knowledge to the interpretation of real-world images and scenes, in a semantically rich and meaningful manner.Anticipated outcome and impacts: It is hard to overstate the potential impact that this project could have on DoD capabilities, by enabling multiple different mission critical technologies that all depend, as people do, on the ability to effectively extract physical semantics from visual scenes. For example, this could greatly facilitate automated processing of large volumes of imagery and monitoring data. Likewise, autonomous robotic systems, which currently depend to a large extent on human operators for their perceptual abilities, could benefit substantially.

Though this approach is a step in the right direction, the memory subsystem based on multiple levels of caches is a , bottlerfeck when. it comes to energy efficiency, scalability, and more importantly programmer productivity; Moreover, whh emerging workloads suchá as large-scale graph analytics and machine learning that have large working sets with irregular memory access patterns and poor data locality, the : behefits of caches are becoming increasingly questionable. ' The objective of this proposal is to rethink and rearchitect the memory subsystem in future processors for high performance irregular workloads by taking advantage of 2.5D/3D electronic-photonic integration and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based silicon photonics. More specifically, the goal is to flatten the memory hierarchy as far as possible by eliminating cache hieprchy to realize a memory system that exhibits low and predictable latency. This is, achieved through a new DRAM !)1icroarchitecture with embedded WDM-based photonic interconnects with all-to-all interconnection capability that is codesigned carefully with the processor and the memory controller. The key facet of the new DRAM microatchitecture is a significantly higher number of active mini-banks with integrated .

' An important deliverable of the project is a quantitative understanding of l_atency and energy per bit requirements of future DRAMs so that cache hierarchy can be eliminated for the benchmarks in consideration. This can have a broad impact on the design of.future DRAMs and processor architectures.

0,Functional Pattern Formation in Thermodynamical Systems,United States Department of the Army,to James Crutchfield,"What thermodynamic effort do open nonlinear systems expend as they spontaneously form complex patterns? Do highly complex organizations require more energy dissipation than simple ones? Or, are macroscopic patterns relatively neutral in terms of total system energy? Are increased fluctuations in entropy production a thermodynamic harbinger of pattern emergence? The answers, surprisingly unavailable at the present, late stage of statistical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics, appears to require a novel synthesis. This project brings together exciting results from three active research areas to address these questions. The first---information thermodynamics---connected recent advances in nonequilbrium thermodynamics with information theory to provide a cutting-edge understanding of Maxwell's Demon. It answers questions such as "" Can a Demon extract energy from a thermal bath utilizing control information? How can information be a fuel?"" Having come to fruition in the last two decades or so, the second---pattern formation theory---describes the mechanisms that drive spatially-extended systems to spontaneously organize into patterns of activity. It provides techniques that predict how a system dynamically amplifies inherent instability to macroscopic scales, eventually stabilizing emergent patterns via nonlinear attenuation. The third---meromorphic functional calculus--- provides the key new mathematical methods required to analyze the infinite-dimensional hidden linear dynamic of complex spatial patterns and temporal behaviors---patterns and behaviors implicated in both information thermodynamics and pattern formation. Success in the proposed synthesis will impact both our fundamental physical understanding of the energetics guiding far-from-equilibrium pattern formation and our ability to engineer and control emergent patterns that support functional behaviors, such as information processing, computation, and energy conversion. The abiding puzzle is how these systems balance constraint and fluctuation in the service of their functionality. All physical, chemical, and biological systems and all designed technologies are subject to thermodynamic constraints---energy conservation, entropy increase during macroscopic manipulations, and the like . This is especially true and challenging for those whose functioning relies on information processing embodied in emergent patterns. Nanoscale technology most aptly illustrates these fundamental limits. At these scales, we encounter finite-size induced fluctuations that can compromise a device's operation. Even technologies that do not yet depend on quantum effects have rapidly approached limits imposed by microscopic fluctuations. Similar conclusions hold for chemical and biomolecular processes. For example, motor proteins carry-out essential biological functions, such as intracellular nutrient transport, all the while bathed in fluctuations whose energetics fall at the same scale as the ATP-driven motion itself . On the one hand, the increasing demand for computation, combined with the nee d for new computational architectures and substrates, and our increasing ability to control and even design biological processes, on the other, make the proposed synthesis particularly relevant and timely. Understanding the functioning of this wide range of systems turns on developing a new theory of functional pattern formation in thermo-dynamical systems---systems that, at one and the same time, are dynamical systems (behaving and processing and storing information) and are large-scale physical systems (consisting of energetic microscopic subsystems). Our expertise in the above three research areas will bring unique perspectives and insights to this challenge, increasing the likelihood of success.less","1,099,948",2017,2020

0,A miniature RFID sensor for biological warfare agents (BWAs) detection,United States Department of the Air Force,to Chujen Lin,"The current program aims to develop a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensor system to identify fermentors used for BWAs growth. BWAs may have many very different molecular structures/ mutations, but one antibody is only efficient for one type of BWA. Instead of have one sensor detecting each type of Anthrax, We plan to design molecular taggants such as DNA aptamers and Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) to detect the BWAs byproduct, which are present in the growth media and have fewer variations in molecular structures, to assess whether a fermentor is used for BWAs production. During this Phase II project, we will design, fabricate, and characterize a novel miniature RFID sensor for detection in liquid solution. We will also develop a compact and portable RFID reader that allows interrogation of the RFID sensor from a safe stand-off distance clandestinely. Intelligent Automation, Inc. will team up with University of California, Davis, to conduct this research. The proposed BWAs sensor system is critical to enable military and homeland security personnel to identify potential bioterrorism attacks and take timely actions to mitigate dangers.

0,NUCLEAR AND RADIOLOGICAL SCIENCES OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVE,United States Department of the Navy,to WESLEY FREY,"“The Nautilus Program” will be a STEM Education program at the University of California Davis (UCD) McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC) which is located near Sacramento, California. The Director of MNRC proposes to establish The Nautilus Program to inspire, educate, and encourage students (early high school, community college, undergraduate, and graduate) to engage in and pursue STEM related careers, especially in the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. The Nautilus Program will be a comprehensive education and outreach program to highlight the nuclear sciences and their importance to the US Navy. There are unmet needs to (1) support our national defense by training more students to participate in the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program and impart technical and safety skills in nuclear reactor operators; (2) increase engagement from non-coastal areas in Navy areas of interest. MNRC proposes a cost effective innovative education model where a one-of-a-kind research facility houses an outreach and education program that is capable of performing hands-on activities with a large number of high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students. Efforts related to the establishment of the outreach program and college level curriculum will be optimized by utilizing already existing outreach programs and academic departments at UC Davis. The sustainability and goals of this program is ensured by establishing the programs as a permanent part of the MNRC mission. Once the program is established, it will be largely sustained by MNRC’s long standing commercial radiography program which also supports the US Navy (e.g. the fleet ballistic missile program). The Nautilus Program has two key emphasis areas: >Engage students from early high school through community college. Working with established UC Davis outreach programs, Sacramento area high school science teachers will become familiar with, and encouraged to participate in The Nautilus Program. Teachers that wish to participate will be invited with their class to the facility during the normal academic year for a tour and a hands-on experiment. Students showing an interest in the subject matter will be encouraged to participate in the MNRC summer programs (via UC Davis outreach established programs). These summer programs will have smaller groups and will cover about 10 times the content of the high school programs that take place during the normal academic year. In this model, hands-on experience with a nuclear reactor and interaction with numerous Navy veterans (officers and enlisted) will be the centerpiece of the program. Curriculum for high school students will be based on the recently approved California “Next Generation Science Standards for California Public Schools.” Curriculum for community college students will be similar but more in-depth than the high school curriculum. >Engage and educate college level students in the nuclear and radiological sciences. This will be accomplished by a series of initially two, but ultimately three classes taught at UC Davis; permanent classes that utilizes the MNRC reactor. Curriculum for college level courses will be based on the established and accredited programs at UC Berkeley and Oregon State University. The classes will be available to all undergraduate and graduate students in technical majors. This will include the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering program and the NROTC program (e.g. midshipmen who are considering the Navy Nuclear Program). These classes will provide undergraduate students a technical basis in nuclear and radiological sciences sufficient to enter the Navy workforce or continue their education in nuclear/radiological science and later join the Navy workforce. For graduate students, these classes will provide a technical basis in the nuclear and radiological sciences sufficient to pursue cross disciplinary work in fields of Navy interest with the potential to join the Navy workforce.less","750,000",2017,2018

0,Extending the Bandwidth of a Low-speed Arbitrary Waveform Generator to Synthesize Ultra-wideband Rec,United States Department of the Navy,to Anh-Vu Pham,"We propose to develop an ultra-wideband compact transceiver that has software-defined pulse generation, digital predistortion, and bandwidth reconfigurability. The transceiver consists of a wideband software-defined transmitter enhanced by digital pre-distortion algorithms and a high sampling-rate programmable receiver. The proposed transmitter architecture includes a compact arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), a non-linear transmission line (NLTL) to sharpen pulses to expand the bandwidth of input signals from the AWG, a high-speed switch network to support multiple antennas, and timing circuitry for operation with a receiver. In this architecture, we use a single transmitter source and effectively switch for multiple antenna channels at high frequency. We will develop a non-linear transmission line with minimal distortion in the compressed output pulse. To further minimize distortion, we will develop digital predistortion (DPD) algorithms to pre-compensate for the NLTL’s unwanted dispersion. To assist the development of our DPD algorithms, we plan to develop a transfer function for the NLTL using advanced X-parameters. The transfer function will capture accurate phase and amplitude information at fundamental and harmonic frequencies over 10 GHz bandwidth. Furthermore, we plan to incorporate machine learning to improve DPD algorithms. Machine learning is predicted to lead to a more precisely corrected output by leveraging previously-known DPD results. Using NLTL, we aim to achieve the reduction of the output pulse’s full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) from an AWG by a factor of 3 which will triple the transmitter’s bandwidth. The transmitter will emit FWHM pulses with widths in the range of 100-320 ps and voltage swings up to 20 V peak-peak. In parallel, we propose to develop a novel stepped-pulse transceiver that will up-convert trains of pulses from a low-frequency AWG to cover a 10 GHz bandwidth. Preliminary results have shown that this type of transmitters offers increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over single pulses. The proposed architecture is a low-bandwidth (< 2.5 GHz) AWG followed by a high-bandwidth low-distortion mixer fed by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controlled RF synthesizer. The receiver will associate each pulse with the synthesizer’s frequency and classify it accordingly. In a digital signal processing block, the receiver will recombine the pulses with optimal weighting coefficients according to a general recombination algorithm. We expect that this transceiver will offer a ??? (??-pulses) increase in SNR. A key factor in the transceiver’s novelty is its on-the-fly reconfigurability. We can program the FPGA’s control to focus RF energy on a specific bandwidth to increase power spectral density, potentially creating dramatic improvements in SNR. Both the stepped-pulse transmitter and NLTL-based software-defined transmitter require a programmable receiver. On the receiving side, we propose to develop a time-equivalent FPGA-based sampling receiver with an 8:1 switch network for 8 receive antennas, timing circuitry for operation with a software-defined transmitter, a bandwidth of larger than 10 GHz, and a selectable equivalent sampling rate of up to 100 GS/s. This receiver is required to support the novel reconfigurability of both proposed transceivers. We propose to develop a novel cavity-based Vivaldi antenna to achieve high and flat gain in a compact size. We will incorporate an innovative resistor loading technique to significantly reduce the antenna’s size. The cavities are holes drilled into the antenna’s arm structures to provide localized current density enhancement. Electrically, the cavities will enhance the antenna’s gain while the total weight of the antenna will be reduced because bulk dielectric material is removed.less","600,000",2022,2025
0,GaN based Static Induction Transistor (GaN-SIT) for high power application,United States Department of the Navy,to Srabanti Chowdhury,"Vertical GaN devices are ideal for high power applications owing to their widebandgap-originated material properties, similar to SiC. What makes GaN vertical devicesmore attractive than SiC, is the capability to offer bulk regions with an electron mobilityover 1200cm2/V??sec and channels regions, often higher than 2000cm2/V??sec withappropriate use of polarization engineering. In spite of our recent advancements, the majortechnological challenges for vertical GaN devices have not yet been adequately addressed,and represent hurdles that cannot be overstated. The lack of a robust buried p-n junction inGaN has, to-date, limited the possibilities of device classes that are typical in Si and SiCtechnologies. Mg is a deep acceptor in GaN offering less than 1% activation under roomtemperature. The percentage of active Mg in the crystal reduces with increasing bandgapmaking it increasingly difficult to realize robust p-n junction performing as designed, underthe switching operation of the devices. The other challenge in GaN is the realization of apristine oxide-semiconductor interface for maintaining high channel mobility. The channelmobility in an Al2O3-GaN interface cannot improve beyond ~ 300cm2/V??s. Lower channelmobility implies a higher Ron besides oxide-GaN interface introducing trapping and poorthreshold voltage control under switching operation. All variants of vertical GaNMOSFETs and CAVETs suffer from both of these issues, and therefore while tacklingthese issues, we will focus on static induction transistors (SIT). For its functioning, a SITDOES NOT rely on the p-type doping, polarization doping, or the gate oxide dielectriclayer for active transport. A successful SIT performance ensures high-voltage switching athigher frequencies (up to 500MHz); broadening the window of possibilities for reliableapplications.SiC SITs have shown the potential for high power and high frequency applications.With higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than SiC, GaN SITs have thepotential to operate at higher frequency with higher output power.less","599,645",2018,2021

0,ARO: Advanced Security Games For Cyber-Physical Systems,United States Department of the Army,to Prasant Mohapatra,"Advanced sophisticated cyber attacks is a major concern for the nation's infrastructure systems and the information technology systems in corporations. These attacks, often classified under the name, Advanced Persistent Threat, (APT), are launched by highly motivated attackers with abundant resources, and are persistent in compromising a system as long as the expected payoff is high. These attacks lead to significant degradation of our technological advantage and could inflict massive damage to our nation's infrastructure and its security. They are extremely difficult to combat because they are inherently adaptive, exhibiting dynamic behavior in response to defense actions. Developing defense mechanisms against these APT attacks is critical to the safety and security of our nation, its technological resources, and its secrets. Many of today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) are organized in a networked and layered structure; each layer carries out a specific set of functions, which may depend on functions or impact functionality implemented at other layers. Such dependence is beneficial to the normal operation of the system, but can also be utilized by an attacker to harm the system. Moreover, a myopic defense action focusing on a specific attack observed at one level may lead to inefficiencies or vulnerabilities at other levels and trigger new attacks. Therefore, an efficient defense strategy against APT attacks must take the interdependencies among the components in a networked system into account. For a networked system with multiple interdependent levels and that are possibly operated by multiple entities with self-interest, it becomes even more critical to design defense mechanisms that are aligned to their incentives, for both the defenders and the attackers. The overall goal of the proposed research is to study game theoretical models to understand the incentives and fundamental tradeoffs involved in defending/attacking multi-level networked systems, and to design efficient defense strategy accordingly. Although game theory has been extensively applied to cybersecurity and network security, traditional models are mainly static with complete information, and largely ignore the risk of a system being attacked at multiple levels that have inherent dependencies. We first propose a two-player dynamic game with imperfect/incomplete information to capture the persistency and adaptivity of the players. Our game model hinges on the interdependence structure of a networked system, which determines both the action spaces of the players and the information structure of the game. Building upon the dynamic game model, we will address the major challenges in defending against APT attacks by carrying out the following three tasks. Defense against the Unknown: To defend against advanced attackers with unknown or uncertain behavior, we propose to develop adaptive defense strategies that can achieve a guaranteed payoff. By utilizing learning frameworks, we will further investigate the impact of stealth behavior and bounded rationality in the context of security games. Multi-level Attack/Defense: In this thrust, we propose to investigate the impact of multi-level dependencies and design coordinated defense strategies accordingly. We propose to identify both the challenges and the opportunities imposed by the dependencies, and propose strategies that can minimize the impact of the attacks as a whole. Multi-player Security Games: A large CPS often faces attacks of different types in terms of their dynamics and objectives. We propose to extend the game models to allow multiple independent attackers with diverse behavioral patterns. We will further consider the setting when a large system is managed by multiple entities (defenders) with self-interest, hence has to be protected through joint investment.less","575,000",2015,2018
0,Development of Wide Bandwidth and Tunable Circuits and Antennas for Ultra-wideband Radar Applications,United States Department of the Navy,to Anh-Vu Pham,"Signal integrity is key to the performance of a ground penetration radar system. To achievehigh performance, clutter should be minimized and signals reflected from targeted objects shouldbe highly distinguished with reflections from ground, antennas, and any circuits within a transmittingchain. In the past decades, research on ultra-wideband antennas has primarily been focusedon bandwidth, radar cross-section, gain, etc. [1, 2]. Other antenna research efforts take a morecomprehensive approach to consider soil models and the signal integrity of transmitted and receivedpulses [3, 4]. However, the study of time-domain pulses is only limited to the antennaitself. Unwanted reflections can come from open ends, a feed-point of an antenna, interfacedpassive circuits (baluns, feed structures, etc.) to an antenna and signal power levels. In addition,these studies are also limited to individual antenna evaluation rather than actual ground penetrationradar deployments. Usage scenarios and actual environment effects are often not taken into account.A resistively loaded vee dipole antenna (RLVD) is an excellent representation. While ithas been developed for ultra-wideband radar systems, the design and implementation that maintainsexcellent signal integrity have not been perfected.An important application of an ultra-wideband ground penetration radar system is to detectland mines with a diameter of ~8 cm and height of 4 cm in a depth in order of ~10 cm. In order toresolve land mine features, the signal peak frequencies should be around 4 GHz to 6 GHz (shortpulses). The bandwidth of a typical ground penetration radar system is around 500 MHz to 6 GHzwhich compromises radar performance. The conductivity of soil becomes quite lossy above 1GHz. Thus, it is challenging for high-frequency signals to penetrate deep into ground. While lowfrequency signals (below 500 MHz) can penetrate deeper into ground, the frequency bandwidthratio of the radar will become larger than 12:1. In previous decades, antennas and passive circuitcomponents relying on electromagnetic coupling and resonant structures (half-wavelength transmissionlines, etc.) have limited bandwidth ratios. The largest bandwidth ratio 46:1 of a passivebalun using broadside transmission lines (without any ferrite materials) was reported by the PI [5,6]. To cover the low frequency ends, an antenna or a passive device must have a much larger sizewhich also causes much higher conductor losses at high frequencies. An alternative approach isto use ferrite materials that have high permeability. Many of these ferrite components are handwoundstructures that have limited GHz frequency performance and cause significant signal variations.There have been very little research efforts to develop wide bandwidth components froma few MHz~s to multi-GHz~s with compact size, low loss, consistent electrical performance andtuning capabilities.In this project, we propose 1) develop and improve the signal integrity of an integrated balunand restively loaded vee dipole antenna (500 MHz-8 GHz) using advanced multi-layered LiquidCrystal Polymer boards for current ultra-wideband radar systems, 2) develop ultra-wideband antennasand related passive circuits with large bandwidth ratios (~800:1) and tuning capabilities,and 3) develop high power low noise amplifiers for pulse receivers using an advanced GalliumNitride (GaN) semiconductor to handle high reflections with improvements more than 1000 times.less","550,485",2017,2020

We propose to achieve such unprecedented performance on a chip-scale platform through combining the following unique approaches. 1. On-chip optical frequency shifter which also provides optical isolation: we will demonstrate an electro-optically modulated waveguide which shifts the optical frequency with essentially no residual baseband or sidelobes while providing optical isolation from back reflection.

These high energy impacts cause extreme loading conditions such as high pressure andstrain rate, which can result in material damage, deformation and failure. In order to efficiently design high-performance glasses which can withstand these extreme environments, understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying shock loading, deformation and failure is critically needed. However, creating such high pressure, strain rate and temperature conditions in lab settingare challenging. Additionally, most of the studies have focused on characterizing the material behavior ex situ, after the shock loading cycle is complete. Thus, understanding the failure mechanism gets complicated due to different material response during initial shock, post-shock and subsequent reverberations. In this proposal, I will utilize laser-induced dynamical loading conditions to elucidate structural evolution and deformation behavior at ultrafast timescales.Technical Approach: I will combine two approaches, ultrafast laser excitation and x-ray scattering techniques, to unravel the fundamental mechanism underlying the deformation dynamics in soda-lime float glasses. Ultrafast optical lasers provide a unique way to access dynamical loading conditions in the lab environment by achieving pressure range of 10-200 GPa and strain rate of 104/s to 107/s. Time-resolved x-ray scattering techniques will be utilized to investigate laser-driven material behavior in-situ (during initial and post-shock) at femtosecondnanosecond timescales. This method will allow us to characterize structural dynamics and phase transformation, as the material is undergoing shock loading and unloading. These studies are now feasible due to development of x-ray free electron facilities which provide fast and high intensityx-rays required for such experiments. The strong background of PI in ultrafast control of electronic materials and advanced x-ray techniques will ensure successful outcome of the project.Anticipated Outcome: Proposed time-resolved x-ray studies will provide in-situ measurements of structural dynamics, nanoscale behavior and phase transition, which cannot be accessed by typically utilized optical techniques. The atomistic understanding from these studies will be critical for understanding failure mechanisms and polymorphic behavior in glasses. Unveiling the laserdriven shock loading at relevant timescales and lengthscales will add an important piece to the puzzle of transformation pathways of glasses. The microscopic understanding developed by these studies including strain behavior, shock front evolution, nucleation and growth pathways, will leadto refinement of existing theoretical models to accurately describe materials in extreme conditions. Impact on DoD capabilities: The fundamental understanding provide by these studies will enable development of high-performance glasses for shields and protections which can endure extreme shock-loading conditions. The advances in design of material structure implemented from outcomes of these studies will allow for reduced life-cycle costs and higher strength glasses.Additionally, the characterization tools developed here can be extended to understanding shock physics in other Navy-relevant materials such as polymers, composites and other glassy systems. Thus, the outcomes of our studies directly aligns to the goals of Naval R&D framework and ONRMaterials and Structures under Extreme Conditions program under Code 33 and Division 332.less","540,790",2019,2022

0,Superradiant Smith-Purcell Emission in the Mid-Infrared via Guided-Wave Electron Optics,United States Air Force,to WILLIAM PUTNAM,"The mid-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is of fundamental interest to science and technology. With wavelengths from around 3 to 20 micrometers, this part of the electromagnetic spectrum has numerous scientific, industrial, and medical applications ranging from spectroscopy to surgery, as well as military applications ranging from sensing to countermeasures. In recent years, compact laser and photonictechnologies have pushed to longer wavelengths in the infrared. However, despite advances in quantumcascade lasers, difference-frequency-generation systems, and other photonic technologies, compact midinfraredsources offer limited wavelength tunability and comparatively low output powers. At frequenciesbelow the infrared, in the microwave domain, electron-beam-driven sources of electromagnetic radiationhave been incredibly successful. However, efficiently scaling these devices to output wavelengths below~1 mm, without the use of relativistic electron beams (as in free-electron lasers), has proven challenging.In this project, we will use guided-wave techniques, inspired by photonics, to overcome this challenge. Wewill develop microscale electron-beam waveguides (analogous to nano-photonic waveguides) to tightlyconfine kilo-electronvolt (keV) electron beams near engineered electromagnetic-coupling structures in order to generate mid-infrared light with tremendous wavelength tunability and power scalability. Specifically, in this program, we will use electron-beam waveguides to enhance Smith-Purcell interactions. We will extend Smith-Purcell emission from the spontaneous regime to the domain of collective effects, the so-called superradiant regime.less","450,000",2021,2024

What makes GaN vertical devices moreattractive than SiC, is the capability to offer bulk regions with electron mobility over1200cm2/V??sec. Due to higher carrier mobility made possible by superior growthtechniques, the figure of merit offered by GaN diodes or FETs is higher compared to SiCcounterparts. From TCAD drift diffusion simulation we have shown the advantage ofGaN devices become rapidly significant over SiC diodes at higher voltages. A GaNCAVET is only 0.4% more efficient compared to a SiC MOSFET but at 8KV, owing tothe higher bulk (electron) mobility the GaN device efficiency is over 7.4%, which islargely significant. However, the high voltage (>1KV) space is yet to be explored inGaN. Systematic research is warranted to understand the potential of GaN, which startswith a robust growth program to develop GaN epi to attain high voltage (> 5kV) p-ndiodes, thereby making it a competitive technology.

0,The Electronic Ingredients for Oxide High-Tc: Making Connections Between Cuprates and Bismuthates,United States Air Force,to Inna Vishik,"High temperature copper-oxide (cuprate) superconductors and bismuth-oxide (bismuthate) superconductors both have disputed, and likely different, mechanism of superconductivity. The electronic ingredients which produce higher superconducting transition temperature (Tc) can be uncovered via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on single-layer cuprates (Tc, maximum=95K) and bismuthates (Tc, maximum=30K). ARPES has singularly elucidated many unconventional superconductors by measuring the energy vs momentum relationships of electrons in solids in a direction-resolved manner. Comprehensive and precise experimental determination of energy vs momentum relationships can directly inform an accurate mechanism for superconductivity, by virtue of clarifying how electrons move in a solid and how they interact with excitations responsible for superconductivity. However, such information is scarce or unavailable for the specific compounds of interest to this study, in part because of challenges in producing a smooth surface during the necessary cleaving procedure at the start of an experiment. This will be addressed by implementing controlled cleaving tools, numerically accounting for surface topography, and performing ARPES experiments which isolate microscopic portions of a sample. The goals of this study will be to use two different families of oxide superconductors to mutually inform which electronic behaviors are associated with high Tc, and to develop experimental and numerical tools to harness modern ARPES capabilities for imperfectly-cleaved or even polycrystalline samples. The former will inform how to engineer superconductors, particularly isotropic ones, with even higher Tc, and the latter will allow for this experimentally-driven design of materials’ electronic properties to be extended to phenomena well beyond superconductivity.less","450,000",2018,2021
0,Intrinsic Information Processing and Energy Dissipation in Stochastic Input-Output Dynamical Systems,United States Department of the Army,to James Crutchfield,"Recent theoretical and experimental advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide a new understanding of how ÒintelligentÓ control can convert information to energy. However, these approaches have yet to account for the diverse kinds of information that complex nonlinear systems are capable of producing and storing. This is particularly a concern regarding the diversity of differently structured irreversible processes, which play key role in limiting computation. Fortunately, computational mechanics accounts for this diversity, but in autonomous dynamical systems. Thermodynamic cycles that perform useful information processing are nonautonomous systems. To analyze information processing in nonautonomous systems, computational mechanics must be ex- tended to controlled dynamical systems. Additionally, it must be augmented to account for the energetics that support information generation and storage. The projectÕs goal was to synthesize the new nonequilibrium thermodynamics and computational mechanics into a single framework. The project successfully reached this goal and, leveraging that success, the research effort continues under the ARO-based MURI ""Information Engines"" (W911NF-13-1-0390), under the PI's leadership.

0,"Sparse Optimization: Algorithms, Theory, and Software",United States Department of the Navy,to Michael Friedlander,"Statement of Work:The PI will develop methods for solving large-scale optimization problems for problems arising in sensor processing, statistics, and big data.Objective:The objective of this proposal is to develop techniques for sparse optimization, which is a class of Optimizationproblems designed to yield solutions that satisfy some notion of low complexity. Modern application of sparseoptimization abound: in machine learning, computational statistics, and signal processing, sparsity (and moregenerally, low complexity) have proven effective in exposing meaningful structure present in underlying data, or in deriving a simplified description of a process. In machine learning, for example, low-complexity solutions are crucial for obtaining meaningful and simplified inference procedures. Applications include robust classification and recommender systems. Compressed sensing provides another notable example: it specifies conditions under which it is possible torecover a signal by taking far fewer measurements than its ambient dimension. In almost all cases, a crucialcomputational step is to solve a non-smooth optimization problem designed to yield a sparse solution. In practice,sparse-recovery applications give rise to highly structured large-scale optimization problems. New applications and problem formulations continue to make it clear that existing theories often are not adequate. New technologies, such as fast digital-data acquisition in traditional fields such as signal processing, give rise to vast problems that challenge our notions of the effectiveness of current workhorse algorithms. The aim of the research in this proposal is to designprincipled algorithms, supporting theory that establishes guarantees, and software implementations for the solution of sparse optimization problems at unprecedented scale. Because reliablesoftware implementation is essential for effectively transferring optimization to practitioners and researchers in other fields, it is an integral component of this research program.Approach:Several different approaches to the problems outlined above are explored. All are based on exploiting useful structure to avoid the pitfalls that plague current workhorse algorithms, and make them unsuitable for large problems (e.g., because they rely on prohibitively expensive computational kernels such as eigenvalue decompositions), or for problems with difficult data (e.g., ill-conditioning that prevents first-order methods from converging). Several different approaches will be considered. An essential step in developing practical approaches for efficiently optimizing modelswith huge numbers of variables is to identify useful structure that can be exploited by implementable algorithms. Several research directions are planned:-- Exploit sparse-recovery guarantees that ensure that the underlying sparse optimization problems have far fewer constraints than variables. This is accomplished by phrasing sparse optimization problems in the framework of gauge optimization, and solving certainhighly structured and relatively small dual problems.-- The objective-constraint reversal procedure pioneered by the PI and collaborators has been the basis for the very successful SPGL1 software package. Research will be conducted for applying this reversal procedure to matrix-valued problems. Preliminary results show that the correct formulations can be used to completely avoid the cost of the proximal iteration, using Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms.--Develop a software architecture based on fact that an enormous family of sparsity- promoting regularizers and their proximal maps fit into the framework of quadratic support functions. This point of view potentially allows for a single efficient implementation to apply to a wide variety of problems.Overall Merit and ONR Mission/Relevance:The PI has proposed innovative methods for solving large-scale optimization problems arising in signal analysis, statistics, and big data.

0,Interactive Reasoning and Games with Awareness of Unawareness (Research Topic: Information Sciences),United States Department of the Army,to Burkhard Schipper,"Unknown unknowns are pervasive in defense. The limited situational awareness of a Sol dier in a battlefield is likely to imply unknown unknowns. The covert state of mind of an adversary poses unknown unknowns to intelligence officers. A procurement officer who is tasked with the development of a portfolio of novel defense technologies is facing unknown unknowns about capabilities and cost driving factors. These examples are not just situa tions under plain uncertainty, in which the decision maker can envision all contingencies and judges their likelihood probabilistically. They are also not situations under ambiguity or Knightian uncertainty, in which the decision maker lacks the confidence to judge the likelihood of contingencies probabilistically but still can envision all relevant contingen cies. Rather, these are situations, in which the decision maker lacks comprehension or even conception of some of the contingencies. This is unawareness.There is a recent growing interdisciplinary literature on the logic, decision theory, and game theory with unawareness and first applications to economics, contract theory, finance, business strategy, conflict resolution, political science, and strategic network for mation. However, one foundational question that is of importance to many potential applications of unawareness remained open: How to model awareness of unawareness in a tractable way? In models of unawareness, if a decision maker is unaware of an event, then she is unaware that she is unaware of that event. Yet, we often realize that there could be something that we are unaware of. This refers to awareness of unawareness. This project develops the logic and game theory with awareness of unawareness. In the first part of the project, we develop multi-agent quantified unawareness structures that allow for reasoning about knowledge of unawareness. The second part of the project extends this to quantified unawareness type-spaces that allow for reasoning about prob abilistic beliefs of unawareness. These type-spaces are applied in the third part of the project, which develops Bayesian games with awareness of unawareness of actions, play ers, and payoÀ-relevant events. This class of games is then applied to the development of mechanism design under awareness of unawareness. Potential applications relevant to the mission of the Army comprise of mechanisms for the procurement and the management of portfolios of novel weapons, security games, and support systems for decisions under awareness of unawareness.less","427,372",2022,2025
0,Tailoring of ceramic microstructures by electric field-activated grain growth,United States Department of the Army,to Klaus van Benthem,"The successful sintering of nanometric spinel powders to relative densities above 95% represents milestone #1. The agglomeration and intra-agglomerate strength of spinel powders represents a potential risk to reach the first milestone. Our previous studies have demonstrated that spinel powders can exhibit intra-agglomerate strength that hinders successful densification [81]. Should this problem arise we will pursue the synthesis of MgAl2O4 nanopowders using co-precipitation techniques previously established by Rufner and Castro [45]. Confirmation that the activation energy for grain growth is lowered by the applied field strength requires annealing at various temperatures between 700¡C and 1300¡C while maintaining an applied electric field strength of 1000V/cm. An Arrhenius analysis of the grain growth rate as a function of inverse temperature will allow for the determination of the respective activation energy for grain growth. Such series will be carried out for different applied field strengths above and below 1000 V/cm in order to evaluate the variation of activation energy. The objective of this series of experiments is to find an analytical expression of the activation energy in the presence of applied electric fields. Completion of this experimental series represents milestone #2. Identification of potentially occurring alternative grain growth mechanisms due to the applied electric field requires annealing of microstructures at constant temperature for different time intervals t2-t1=Delta_t and varying electric field strength. Analysis for changes in average grain size will allow determination of the associated grain growth exponent n and the associated pre-factor Kg0, which includes the activation energy. Measurements of grain sizes and grain size distributions using SEM and precession electron diffraction will be accommodated by an analysis of the local stress states surrounding grain boundary core structures. Nanodiffraction experiments will allow spatial mapping of stress states, and a subsequent correlation with the applied electric field. Successful determination of grain growth exponents that may or may not change in the presence of electric fields will represent milestone #3. One fundamental question is to what extent the applied electric field will interact with the space charge zone surrounding individual grain boundaries. EELS analysis can provide detailed information about the kind of defect structures and their distribution in the vicinity of grain boundary planes as a function of applied electric field strength during annealing. The successful confirmation of specific defect structures in MgAl2O4 and the correlation of their distribution with the applied field strength will represent milestone #4. Below a suitable temperature directional grain growth is expected since the applied electric field has the largest impact on grain boundaries that are perfectly aligned with the field direction. Dependent on the findings that lead to milestone #2, annealing experiments will be designed with increasing electric field strengths while minimizing simultaneous heating. The goal of this experimental approach is to identify annealing parameters for uni-directional grain growth, which will likely occur in the direction parallel to the electrical field. Accomplishing controlled uni-directional grain growth will mark milestone #5.less","424,388",2016,2019
0,Millimeter-wave Networking in Transient Topologies,United States Department of the Army,to Prasant Mohapatra,"The millimeter-wave spectrum has emerged as a new frontier in designing the next generation of high-speed wireless networks. With the availability of a large unlicensed spectrum at 60 GHz, WLANs and cellular networks can provide multi-gigabit per second data rates. Such gigabit wireless links can enable a range of military applications such as real-time data sharing and video streaming between the autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating platooning and coordinated emergy and combat response. However, millimeter-wave wireless links are susceptible to blockages and mobility due to their directionality and high frequency. This requires continuous beam searching and steering to maintain connectivity. These challenges are especially aggravated in military scenarios where the underlying topology is transient (for example, vehicle to vehicle mmWave communication in a platoon moving at a high speed). Conventional beamforming protocols are ineffective for such scenarios of mmWave V2V communication where contact and line-of-sight (LoS) durations are very short and connectivity is frequently hampered by transient blockages. The objective of this project is to systematically understand the impact of transience on mmWave links and to design beam adaptation and management techniques custom-tailored for transient topologies in military settings. The exploration will be divided into three tasks: (1) The first task will be to analytically study beam coherence time and LoS probability of mmWave links with respect to vehicular mobility, density, and presence of transient blockages. The study will be followed by an investigation on how transient reflections from other vehicles can be predicted and exploited in real-time with limited beamsearching. (2) While the vehicular reflections are helpful in low to moderate density and blockage, the second task will explore the use of ambient reflectors to maintain the link connectivity. Given that existing methods of beamsearching are not sufficient for short-lived, transient connection durations, this task will include exploring the camera imagery and use of machine learning techniques to identify, locate and leverage the reflectors for maintaining mmWave links. (3) The existing methods of interference estimation and medium access in presence of beamsearching are ineffective for mmWave V2V networks. To address this problem, interference estimation techniques with low measurement overhead will be designed. These techniques will be integrated into two types of medium access protocols. In the first protocol, the link interference information will be shared over a low-frequency backbone, while in the second protocol, a completely distributed, random access with spatial backoffs on different mmWave paths will be investigated, requiring no medium access coordination between vehicles. The three tasks will create a comprehensive solution space that can realize the true potential of mmWave wireless in transient network topologies. The proposed research will be evaluated through experimentation on mmWave testbeds at George Mason University and the University of California, Davis. The experimental evaluation will include a real-world deployment of 60 GHz mmWave commodity and software radio devices. A simulation framework based on Remcom ray-tracing propagation modeling, Sumo vehicle mobility modeling, and NS3 packet-level network simulation will be used to create large-scale evaluations of the proposed techniques and protocols.less","413,655",2022,2024

0,Metastable Grain Boundary Configurations for Ultrahigh Strength Nanoceramics,United States Department of the Army,to Ricardo Castro,"Ceramic materials are of key interest for ballistic protection of armored tactical platforms in the U.S. Army. However, to overcome the intrinsic brittleness found in monolithic parts, better fundamental understanding on the mechanisms of load accommodation must be established. Together with novel synthesis and processing strategies that can enable unique micro and nano-structural configurations exploiting those mechanisms, a new generation of materials with unmatched performances can be created. The present project aims to provide definitive fundamental understanding on the hardness and toughness of ceramics with an extensive grain boundary network, i.e. nanocrystalline ceramics, and to propose non-system specific toughening mechanisms that exploit the dependence of intergranular crack propagation on metastable grain boundary configurations. The mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline ceramics is undoubtedly dependent on the grain boundary characters. However, the dearth of understanding of the relationship between the local characteristics of grain boundaries and the observed macro-properties is still limited as demonstrated by the large number of contradictory trends reported on grain size dependences. For instance, while some authors have suggested the existence of a Hall-Petch dependence (increase of properties linearly with d-1/2, where d is grain size) down to grain sizes below 10nm, some report on the existence of an inverse relation for grain sizes below 100nm. Most of those contradictions emerge from the common presence of residual porosities and impurities in poorly processed ceramics, begging for systematic studies on controlled, pure and fully dense nanoceramics. Therefore, the first goal of this project is to develop a processing strategy in which impurity-free nanoparticles with grain sizes below 5nm are synthesized and sintered under high pressures (up to 2GPa) and high heating rates in a process called High Pressure Spark Plasma Sintering, targeting unprecedented retention of the grain sizes in the nanometer scale (<10nm) while provoking full densification. Materials representative of three crystalline structures will be consolidated, namely ZrO2 (cubic); ZnAl2O4 (cubic/spinel); and ZnO (hexagonal), and the mechanical properties tested as a function of grain sizes. The selection of these materials connects to the second goal of the project, which is to study the dependence of Hall-Petch slopes and inverse behaviors (if any) on the crystal structure and consequent grain boundary character population. Both hardness and toughness will be studied and the mechanisms analyzed by lifting areas of indented (for hardness) and cracked (for toughness) areas by using focus ion beam (FIB) and studying plastic deformation patterns at the atomic level and cracking dependences on grain boundary orientations and energies by utilizing high resolution electron microscopy and microcalorimetry. The third goal of the project is to develop a toughening mechanism that allows simultaneous improvement of hardness and toughness in nanoceramics independent of its crystal structure. To this end, we will exploit a recently discovered (result of a STIR project) connection between the total excess energies from grain boundaries and their spatial distribution and the fracture behavior to design crack propagation control. The effect of selected dopants segregated on grain boundaries on the formation of the space charge layer can enable metastable grain boundary configurations with unprecedented high cohesive strength to arrest crack propagation. More importantly, such metastable configurations are observed to energetically equalize the existing grain boundary population, causing controlled crack branching for unmatched toughness.less","403,295",2018,2021

Success in this project would mean less dependence on images reconstructed by beamforming algorithms and their interpretation by humans. Our methods first construct redundant features that are robust against those deformations by computing the Scattering Transform (ST) representation of input acoustic waveforms. The ST and its variants, which cascade convolutions with multiscale/multifrequency filters followed by nonlinearities (e.g., taking absolute values of the results) and local averaging, have emerged as an alternative to the popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The devices merge nanomechanical (NMEMS) resonators with nanopatterned surfaces made of gold/graphene composites to absorb IR light with desired wavelength and to quickly translate it into a DC voltage. Two different types of ultrathin metasurface absorbers will be explored to decorate NMEMS: (i) hybrid gold-graphene absorbers to provide electrical tunability of the IR absorption while preserving the full-width half maximum (FWHM); and (ii) extremely thin absorbers based on graphene nanostructures that do not mechanically load the NMEMS, aiming to reduce the IR sensor thermal mass and noise. In addition, a phase-differential interrogation scheme is proposed by exploiting a reference and a sensing unit within the same chip. This approach reduces all components of the noise (thermal, optical, mechanical, and electrical) and provides enhanced resilience to environmental factors such as temperature variations and mechanical vibrations, thus enabling the use of this technology in wearable embodiments. This program will demonstrate spectrally selectively IR detectors with a full width half maximum (FWHM)=0.25ÀÀÀÀm located at desired wavelengths in the 1-15ÀÀÀÀm range of the IR band, electrical tunability of the IR absorption up to 15%, noise equivalent power (NEP) in the 10-11-10-12 WHz-1/2 range, and speed of 100s of ÀÀÀÀs.

0,Foundations of Image and Multimodal Data Analysis (Young Investigator Program): Spatial Memory Networks: A Machine Perception Framework for Detecting Familiar and Unfamiliar Objects in Video,United States Department of the Army,to Yong Jae Lee,"Visual object detection (automatically classifying and localizing an object in visual data) is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and has broad applicability in numerous fields including AI, defense, medicine, and agriculture. While there has been a long history of research in detecting objects in static images, there has been relatively little research in detecting objects in videos. (Most works focus instead on tracking, in which the object is manually-annotated in an initial frame.) However, cameras on robots, unmanned vehicles, wearable devices, etc., receive videos and not static images. Thus, for these systems to recognize the key objects and their interactions, it is critical that they be equipped with accurate video object detectors. Existing approaches that detect objects in video simply run a static image-based detector independently on each frame. However, due to the unique challenges of video (e.g., motion blur, low-resolution, compression artifacts), a static image detector cannot generalize well to video. Furthermore, videos provide rich temporal and motion information that should be utilized by the detector during both training and testing for improved performance. In this project, we propose a novel machine perception framework for detecting objects in video. The key contribution is a deep recurrent spatial memory network that models the long-term temporal dependencies of an object's appearance and motion at the pixel-level. By modeling at the pixel-level, our network will provide an interpretable and expressive model of video content. To accomplish these goals, our research objectives are: - Thrust I: Design the spatial memory network to model an object's appearance and motion at the pixel-level over time, and train it to detect objects in videos. Study the limitations of running a static-image detector on video, and explore how modeling long-term temporal dependencies beyond simple short-term motion cues can help detection. - Thrust II: Investigate how to expand our network architecture to detect unfamiliar objects, for which we have no training data. Study the algorithmic changes required, and how to bias the model to detect moving objects rather than static ones. - Thrust III: Explore the various ways in which our models trained for detecting objects in video can serve as a pre-processing step for downstream video applications such as video summarization, search, and annotation propagation. We expect to deliver basic research advancements through scientific publications, mathematical and learning models, and software prototypes. The proposed project entails novel technical contributions in computer vision and machine learning, and will form an integral step towards the overarching goal of object detection in video. Whereas mainstream object detection research focuses on static images, this proposal calls for a distinct emphasis on videos. Our network will be designed to model long-term temporal dependencies and motion cues, to enable the detector to learn to utilize the rich temporal and motion information provided by video. The developed video object detection models and software will be shared with the research community, in order to facilitate video analysis research and applications.less","367,171",2017,2020
0,Context-Rich Predictors for Self-Reflective Autonomy: Variational Foundations,United States Department of the Navy,to Roger Wets,"Among the numerous challenges in autonomy, many are centered around the ability to estimate the current and future state of the world, especially in new and unstructured environments. It is clear that simply relying on the current sensor data alone has severe limitations.Sensors may be too noisy, capture only parts of the environment, and say little about the future. Success of humans and animals to operate in unfamiliar and unstructured environments is due, in part, to two capabilities. First, we are able to predict the current state and even the distant future using contextual information, usually derived from experiences, as a supplement to limited sensor data. Second, we have the ability to assess the effectiveness of a prediction protocol and make adjustments when necessary. The importance of contextual information is of course widely recognized and major efforts in this domain are underwaysuch as those at the Contextual Robotics Institute, UC San Diego. In this proposal, we offer to develop new mathematical tools that will improve the predictive capability of autonomous systems and their ability to self-reect on such capabilities. Specifically, we focus on twomajor tasks:Major Task 1: Develop and analyze a broad class of variational-based nonparametric estimators and ?lters (context-rich predictors) that, in addition to sensor data, account for experiences, contextual information, and uncertainty in such information.Major Task 2: Develop variational theory and protocols for assessing, selecting, constructing, and instantiating context-rich predictors based on sensor data, experiences, and contextual information, and thereby support the development of self-reective autonomy.less","359,871",2017,2020
0,Deep Graph Models of Functional Brain Networks,United States Department of the Navy,to Ian Davidson,"Modeling activity in the human brain as a graph offers many potential uses such as the identification of bio-markers, the effects of pathologies and modeling cognitive networks. However, existing methods of creating graphs for medical imaging greatly simplifies the complex behavior in brains to the most simplest of graphs and then typically simplifies/analyzes these graphs in a single step. The end result is several significant compromises most notably the representation (the graph) is learnt independent of the analysis/computation. The deep learning approach of simultaneously learning a useful representation for a given problem will be applied to graph analysis of medical imaging. A novelty of our work is that unlike previous discriminative deep learning models for classification our models are generative learners. Our goal is directly learning a graph from the raw time series whilst also simultaneously learning a calculation/computation on the learnt graph. Most importantly our method does not learn a single graph graph structure, but rather a multitude of graph structures of different granularity. We explore three deep learning models: an auto-encoder that learns a variety of graphs of various granularity, a Siamese network to learn the graphs properties that differentiates two cohorts and finally a deep network to perform block modeling of information flow where the number of blocks can vary. Importantly we explore interpreting and explaining the results of these methods to a domain scientist using visualization.less","358,556",2018,2021

0,Acquisition of a low-voltage Ar ion mill for site-specific and damage-free TEM sample preparation,United States Department of the Navy,to Klaus van Benthem,"Project Abstract We propose the acquisition of a low-voltage Ar ion mill for site-specific TEM sample preparation. Specifically, the instrument will be utilized for final local polishing of TEM lamellae to remove the amorphous damage layer that is often introduced during focused ion beam (FIB) sectioning. There are numerous research projects on the UC Davis campus, funded by offices of the Department of Defense (DOD), that investigate the structural, mechanical and electrical properties of advanced nanostructured materials. The unique strength of our research programs is based on the combination of materials synthesis, testing of macroscopic properties, and nanoscale characterization under simultaneous application of external stress fields. To accomplish the technical objectives of these programs we use high resolution, aberration-corrected, and in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques to determine the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms of, for instance, plastic deformation, wetting-dewetting transitions, microstructure evolution in bimodal and trimodal aluminum alloys, and electric field assisted formation of grain boundaries. To obtain clean and damage-free samples inert ion beams with energies below 500V are required, which is currently unfeasible for FIB instruments. We therefore propose to acquire an E.A. Fischione NanoMill Model 1040 instrument that will provide capabilities for site-specific broad-beam Ar+ milling at acceleration voltages as small as 50V. Utilization of an inert ion beam avoids alterations of the local chemical compositions while ion induced secondary electron detection enables polishing of specific regions of interest. The availability of the proposed instrument will complement our recently acquired FIB instrument by offering capabilities to minimize or even completely remove any remaining amorphous layers originating from ion beam damage. Existing DOD-funded research efforts on the quantitative atomic scale characterization of nanostructured materials will be supported and strengthened, while new transformative research activities will be enabled. The new capabilities provided by the proposed instrument will be integrated in our undergraduate and graduate education programs in materials science and engineering, and will, therefore, have a direct impact on the training of future scientists and engineers in fields relevant to the DOD mission.less","285,010",2015,

It will build upon a technique the PI invented to intercalate zero-valent metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of layered materials. For example, this group (in work published in 2014 and 2015) demonstrated the intercalation of copper into nanoribbons of MoO3. Heating the structures produced nanometer-scale ordering of the copper, resulting in a superlattice structure and a charge density wave. The color of the MoO3 can be reversibly tuned from transparent to blue through heat and intercalation. An advantage of the intercalation method is that it is relatively straightforward to apply it to a variety of intercalated species to many different hosts, unlike, for example, a growth technique such as molecular beam epitaxy. In addition, the proposal includes investigations of a more basic nature. Using in situ x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (as demonstrated in their 2014 paper in 2D Materials), changes in the material structures can be measured as a function of temperature which will allow explanations in terms of parameters such as lattice strain and bond energy. These studies will provide invaluable guidance for the design of future materials.Relavance/MeritThis is an excellent proposal that is likely to result in important advances in the understanding and application of intercalated species into 2D materials. It fits into the ~Beyond Graphene~ field, but goes in a different direction than much of the current work by vastly expanding the range of composition and tunability of technologically-important materials. The PI has an impressive track record, including her work as a postdoc in which she was the first to demonstrate intercalation of metal species into van der Waals gaps of 2D materials. She is only in her second year at Brown, but her group is already very productive which bodes well for the success of this project. This proposal identifies several 2D materials of technological interest (Si2Te3 for chemical sensors or night-vision goggles, MoO3 for smart windows, and Bi2Se3 as a thermoelectric material and topological insulator), demonstrates an excellent understanding of the known structure and properties of these materials, and proposes a credible route to tuning the electronic and optical properties.

0,"NEPTUNE) High Accuracy, Low Cost Ventilation Verification Tool for Testing and Commissioning HVAC Systems FY2019-000193-AS",United States Department of the Navy,to Caton Mande,"ABSTRACT: Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has identified HVAC systems as critical systemsthat have consistently experienced performance issues. NAVFAC has identified Testing, Adjusting, andBalancing (TAB) of all HVAC systems as an integral component of an in-house acceptance testingprogram designed to improve quality assurance. Exposure to CO2 levels typical of buildings withinadequate ventilation has been demonstrated to significantly affect decision making performance,particularly in the areas of basic strategy and initiative. CO2 levels are expected to be higher in placeswith higher occupant densities (e.g. conference rooms), where critical decisions are often made. Basedon our experience, WCEC researchers believe that existing TAB methods for ventilation systems relytoo heavily on operator expertise, are labor intensive, and do not produce auditable raw data logs.The WCEC proposes development of an innovative ventilation rate measurement tool for TAB that isbased on the well documented method of tracer gas decay. The proposed measurement tool will bedesigned to work as follows:1. Wirelessly-communicating CO2 sensors are distributed throughout a building with a granularityas desired (e.g., each office)2. The building is filled with CO2 to a level 4-5 times that of outdoors3. The ventilation system is operated normally4. The CO2 decay is measured for approximately 20 minutes5. The automated software quickly calculates a ventilation rate for each space6. Adjustments can be made to the ventilation system, and the decay can be measured for another20 minutes, and the process is repeated until design rates are satisfied.7. The sensors are collected and used for the next building.We expect that the tool will significantly reduce the time to test and balance ventilation systems withgreatly improved accuracy. Setup for the test is simple, even in buildings with complex ventilationsystems. The zones tested need to be vacant during measurement as building occupants emit CO2,which would affect the results.WCEC has built a prototype of the tool, tested it an office building with 22 spaces, and compared theresults to measurements taken by a third-party TAB contractor. The tool produced high accuracy results,with excellent repeatability for tests conducted on three separate days.The WCEC will use the project funds for research and development of the proposed tool (includingnetworked sensors and software interface). Field tests at naval facilities will be used to quantify theaccuracy of the instrument for several ventilation systems, and compare the accuracy, functionality, andlabor and material costs of the new instrument to existing methods.less","250,000",2020,2022

In our previous 2-year NEPTUNE 1.0 project, we have successfully developed and validated a multiphysical UAV model, which captures the rotor aerodynamics, motor and motor controller electro-mechanical dynamics, battery electrical dynamics, and frame rigid-body dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first-of-its-kind in capturing all these relevant dynamics, and more importantly, their coupling during UAV operation. Based on the model, we have performed optimal UAV motion planning for basic maneuvers, e.g. straight-line hover-to- hover operation. It is inspiring to find (currently in simulation) that even for such simple maneuver, the multiphysics-informed approach could achieve 6-25% improvement in energy assumption compared with baseline. Besides these exciting findings, we have identified new critical topics to expand and materialize our new approach. The first task of this project is to establish a framework that integrates high-level motion planning with low-level control. The proposed motion planning scheme uses the actual onboard actuation, i.e. PWM command to each rotor, as the decision variables for optimization. While such practice unleashes the full potential of energy saving by exploiting the complete multiphysical dynamics, the obtained open-loop PWM command sequence is not suitable for direct real-time control due to the commonly presented disturbances and stability issues. We plan to integrate the motion planning with real-time feedback control, which regulates certain states of the UAV based on sensor feedback to realize the planned maneuver. Such high-level planning plus low-level control architecture has been a common practice in UAV control, but our new multiphysics-based approach requires a reformulation of the architecture including redefining the planning and control variables, and redesigning the low-level controller. The second task of this project is to apply the new framework for autonomous energy-efficient generic and special UAV operation in real time. First, we will develop the capability for autonomous real-time motion planning to replace the current computation-heavy offline optimization routine. This part of the research would involve establishing a library of planning sequences for different maneuvers, extracting features for different maneuver classes, and using machine-learning methods to train a real-time planning module capable of generating the motion sequence autonomously. Second, we are also interested in enabling novel UAV operation modes. One example is partial-rotor operation, where some rotors are shut off under certain operating and load conditions. Such operating mode has demonstrated energy saving potential, but would require more sophisticated control to ensure safety and reliability, which can be enabled by the proposed multiphysics-based planning and control framework. The proposed research will be collaborated with and supported by the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific. We will also continue our successful experience of mentoring military students. In our NEPTUNE 1.0 project, we have trained 1 ROTC student (among others) on UAV control and testing, who is now an avionic testing engineer with the US Air Force.less","249,954",2021,2023

The objectives of the project are organized under the following Tasks:(Task 1) Technology development and engineering of the electrochemical production of C9-C15 isoalkane/cycloakane jet fuels: This activity describes the deployment of a simple, highly efficient electrochemical cell for the oligomerization of biogenic acetone. Acetone is efficiently derived from biomass via the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation or alternatively the ketonization of acetic acid. In preliminary work, we have obtained a mixture of highly branchedalkanes and cycloalkanes that are related to the products in Tasks 2 and 3 but higher in molecular weight and therefore ideal for use in aviation fuel, a renewable market that is largely underdeveloped compared to diesel-type fuels. In our first NEPTUNE project we generated electrolysis products which, after hydrodeoxygenation, showed conversion to a multicomponent hydrocarbon mixture that was comparable in specifications to commercial Jet-A. In the continuation of this project, we will further optimize the reaction parameters and scale production up to several liters for advanced fuel testing in the Problem Sponsor's Navy laboratory and by Chevron. (Task 2) Engineering the levulinic acid to C8-C9 branched alkane/cycloalkane route to gasoline-type fuels: In earlier work, we demonstrated the technical feasibility of converting levulinic acid, a platform molecule generated in high yield directly from raw biomass, into branched hydrocarbons suitable for use in gasoline. The commercial advantage of this technology is that isoalkanes, which constitute the largest consumer fuel market, are normally difficult to produce from cellulose, which has a linear carbon chain. The method involves highly efficient steps starting from plant biomass all the way to liquid hydrocarbons, with minimal hydrogen usage. Nowthat the technology has been proven at the bench, it is ready to be progressed to the next level, i.e. optimization and scale-up for advanced fuel testing and translation finally to commercial-scale production. The plan for this project is to engineer a continuous process at the liter scale to model its ultimate piloting to hundreds of liters.(Task 3) Technology development of the levulinic acid route to cyclopentadienes and therefrom to high-energy polycyclic hydrocarbons: We have recently concluded a model study of the base-catalyzed dimerization of esters of levulinic acid (cf. Task 2) to give cyclopentadienes. Hydrodecarboxylation/hydrodeoxygenation of these products leads to densely branched, super high-octane cyclopentanes. In collaboration with the Problem Sponsor, we propose here to investigate the cycloaddition of these cyclopentadienes with olefins, which will give substituted bicycloalkanes. Such compounds are related to the tactical synthetic fuel JP-10, used for example by the Tomahawk jet-powered cruise missile. A range of novel, high-energy, biobased propellants will be produced using this approach.DoD Impact: In Tasks (1)-(3) above, arguments can be made for a win for the Navy in terms not only of technological capability advancement and environmental stewardship, but also for the economics of fuel procurement, which will be competitive with that of fuels from petroleum.less","249,860",2023,2024

0,Model Predictive Control Design Incorporating Cyberattack Detectability for Buildings,United States Department of the Navy,to Matthew Ellis,"Industrial control systems (ICSs) are increasingly reliant on advanced networked communications. This trend has contributed to more, opportunities for malicious agents to exploit ICSs. Coupled with this, the complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks have risen,, which have rendered ICSs vulnerable to cyberattacks. The traditional approach for dealing with the cybersecurity of ICSs involves, fortifying information technology (IT) systems to prevent a cyber attacker from gaining access to the ICSs network. While improving, IT cybersecurity may prevent some cyberattacks on ICSs, attackers may circumvent the IT cybersecurity measures over extended period,s. Cyberattacks on industrial ICSs pose a present critical threat. IT-based cybersecurity approaches are insufficient, and control-b,ased approaches are needed. The Department of the Navy (DoN) is amongst those at risk, as it has thousands of ICSs used to monitor a,nd control facilities and buildings used to carry out or support its core missions. These ICSs referred to as facility-related contr,ol systems (FRCSs), control building utilities, electronic security systems, fire and life safety systems, and heating, ventilation,, and air conditioning systems. Disruptions in the operations of these control systems caused by a successful cyberattack may disrupt, the daily operations and take away resources from supporting the core missions. --Integrating cybersecurity considerations directly, into the ICS design is a scalable approach to this problem because having multiple procedures to protect these control systems from, cyberattacks is expensive. A direct connection exists between the detectability of cyberattacks and the control system design. Prev,ious work proved the existence of this connection for systems controlled by a linear controller using a state estimate from a linear, Luenberger observer and monitored by standard residual-based anomaly detection schemes. While the regulatory control layer usually, consists of linear controllers, the supervisory control layer typically employs a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. MPC is uni,quely suited for controlling multi-input multi-output systems subject to system constraints. While MPC is adopted in various industr,ies, integrating cyberattack detectability considerations directly into MPC design has not been extensively studied and is not a str,aightforward extension of existing results. -- In this project, we will develop and demonstrate a MPC design approach that incorpora,tes cyberattack detectability considerations. Specifically, an approach for designing the MPC will be developed that ensures that va,rious false data injection cyberattacks are detectable with standard residual-based anomaly detection schemes. The MPC design approa,ch developed in this project will be applied to prototypical simulated buildings using Energy Plus. The project MVP is the MPC desig,n approach implemented in software. Upon successful completion of this project, significant advancements on integrating attack detec,tability into MPC design will be made.

The immediate potential benefits to the DoN are the identification of the risks posed by potent,ial cyberattacks on FRCSs through extensive Energy Plus simulations, identification of best-practices for tuning strategies for anom,aly detection schemes for cyberattack detection, and a rigorous understanding of the integration of cyberattack detection into the c,ontrol systems.less","247,332",2022,2024

0,THIS GRANT IS A CONTINUATION OF N000141410257 - Passive Wideband Interferometer enabled by non-Foster Quasi-Constant Phase Shifter for Error Feedback Transmitter,United States Department of the Navy,to Qun Gu,"Professor Qun Jane Gu at the University of California, Davis is submitting this proposal titled ÒPassive Wideband Interferometer enabled by non-Foster Quasi-Constant Phase Shifter for Error Feedback TransmitterÓ to ONR in response to BAA 13-023, Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Program (YIP). We propose a 3-year program with the total requested funding of $510,000. Research Problem: This proposal seeks to develop Passive Wideband Interferometer (PWI) based error feedback transmitter (EFBTx) to generate high spectral purity output to enable Simultaneous Transmitting and Receiving (STAR) operations. Existing transmitter linearization techniques with OIMD > -50 dBc and high noises cannot satisfy STAR needs. This is mainly due to the dynamic range constraints from distortion detection circuitries, which have to process not only small distortions and noises but also large signals. The required signal dynamic range (i.e. > 80 dB) is too large to be supported by existing technologies. To remove this constraint, the PI proposes PWI based EFBTx to suppress the large signal before feeding into the error extraction circuitries, therefore alleviating the corresponding dynamic range requirement and simultaneously suppressing noises. To support ultra-wide instantaneous band, i.e. > 2 GHz, non- Foster quasi-constant phase shifter is further proposed to enable a wideband PWI. The non- Foster technique leverages negative inductors or capacitors to overcome the narrow bandwidth in conventional Foster components and break the ÒDarlingtonÓ limit of the achievable bandwidth by using a limited number of components. Analytical and preliminary results indicate that the PWI based EFBTx enabled by non-Foster quasi-constant phase shifter holds great potentials for transmitters to provide ultra clean outputs. Technical Approach: The proposed PWI enabled EFBTx based on non-Foster quasi-constant phase shifters has four key innovations: (1) EFBTx not only boosts the transmitter linearity, but also suppresses the noises to generate ultra clean output signals; (2) PWI, based on quasi-passive implementation, supports ultra-high linearity and low noise performances; (3) non-Foster quasiconstant phase shifters defy the conventionally monotonic increase of reactance with frequencies to achieve ultra-wide instantaneous bandwidth; (4) state-space stability analysis method and low noise and high linearity design methodologies are crucial to push performance limits while maintaining stability. Outcome: We will conduct both theoretical and experimental research to demonstrate the proposed innovative architecture and the enabling component.

ASR capabilities range from dictation, which converts speech into text; to systems that interpret and respond to speech in proper context. In a vast majority of military domains, substantive verbal communication is a critical component of the warfighters primary responsibilities.ASR is yet to become a widely-used feature of training systems despite its potential utility. This phenomenon has persisted despite the improvement of spee infeasible for content developers to modify or extend the speech recognition capability to support specific phraseology and terminology. Also, users cannot rehearse best practices when using ASR independent of a full-on exercise. Finally, it is difficult for students to distinguish between features of the ASR system and the connected training system.

0,"Adaptive Horizon Model Predictive Control and Regulation, Short Horizon Estimation",United States Air Force,to Arthur Krener,"We shall develop Model Predictive Feedback (MPF). Instead of waiting until the next state is known to compute the appropriate value of the control, MPF computes a localfeedback around the predicted value of the next state and when the next state becomesknown it uses the feedback. Since the computation of the feedback can be started beforethe next state is known, we have more time to compute it, so MPF can be used on fasterprocesses. And having a feedback around the nominal optimal trajectory at the current timeadds robustness and may allow us to avoid going to the solver for one or more time steps.We shall also develop Adaptive Horizon Model Predictive Regulation (AHMPR), a technique for tracking a reference using MPC techniques. Like AHMPC, AHMPR will verify inreal time that asymptotic tracking is being achieved.The state estimation problem is dual to the state stabilization problem. Moving HorizonEstimation (MHE) use MPC techniques to estimate the state from partial and noisy measurements. Its roots go back to Minimum Energy Estimation (MEE). We propose to developa discrete time MEE method that will allow us to simplify MHE by making the horizon asshort as possible, one time step.

It can enable indoor scanning radars with many potential applications such as ubiquitous, non-invasive vital sign monitoring, target tracking and gait analysis. We request funding for design and development of mmWave testbed infrastructure for sensing and communication research. The infrastructure will be used to design and evaluate human mobility tracking and motion profiling with accurate channel information and analysis of the reflected signal. The requested equipment and their usage can be summarized as follows. 1. Software radio platforms and 60 GHz RF front-end modules. They will allow us to build mmWave sensing transmitter and receivers wideband signal transmission and detailed channel information of the reflected signal, along with development of PHY/MAC protocols for mmWave networking and sensing. 2. Spectrum analyzer 60 GHz extension modules and oscilloscope.

This testbed instrument would be reconfigurable to support many different architectures. The initial configuration would be composed of two subnets connected by a gateway. Both subnets will have PC-based components and a Macintosh-based component. One will have a GEMSOS high assurance, high security system as a component. The other will have a second computer that can serve as a gateway between the testbed and the Internet. The testbed instrument is intended to be isolated from the Internet much of the time, but it will have components that can provide connectivity to download data or executables from the Internet, upload data, software, and experimental results to hosts on the Internet for further analysis, and to provide remote access to our Indiana University collaborators and their students. This will provide a complete instrument to test and evaluate the effects of attacks, and the effectiveness of security mechanisms developed to mitigate or counter these attacks. These include disruptions and attacks intended to compromise the success of a mission, evaluate deceptive techniques and countermeasures, evaluate the effects of poisoned training and testing data on mechanisms based on machine learning and the effectiveness of the countermeasures, and examine resilience on systems with a variety of levels of assurance. This testbed instrument will enable us to test security mechanisms, to extend our understanding of the effects of attacks and how to ameliorate the damage or compensate for the attacks or counter them. Among the open questions are the metrics to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks and the security mechanisms; how the level of assurance of the attacked system components and networks affects the evaluation, including the effects and metrics to be used; under what conditions compromises can be confined; how to best provide resilience for integrity and availability in a dynamic environment; and how to instrument systems and networks to carry out these evaluations. The testbed instruments will be reconfigurable, so researchers can carry out their analyses with different network configurations and different components on the network. Additional components will enable researchers to develop software needed for experiments, as well as transition experiments to large-scale cyber ranges such as CyberVan. Our testbed instrument will support more interactive experiments than are currently possible with CyberVan which has extensive capability for larger and more turnkey experiments.

0,CoViRCureâ An Immunoprotective Oral Supplement for Reducing COVID-19 Post-Hyperimmunity Period Immune Suppression,United States Department of the Army,to Aynun Begum,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease, induces a hyperimmune response (cytokine storm) upon infection that often leads to hyperinflammation and immunosuppression. During the immunosuppression, the body is susceptible to other infections, which potentially increase mortality rates. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the military’s cumulative hospitalization rate (2%) is 50 times higher than the non-military. After COVID-19 hospitalization or recovery, soldiers or civilians can suffer secondary infections that can be prevented by dietary oral supplements or drugs. An oral dietary supplement, having immunomodulatory action against cytokine storm as well as reducing immunosuppression after COVID-19 infection, is a novel treatment approach. In this context, the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) pathway can be modulated by dietary compounds like vitamin D and beneficial fatty acids to improve overall immunity post-viral infection. Also, this supplement must have all the essential, measurable components found in the blood of prolonged or short recovery COVID-19 patients. The supplement must have a measurably positive outcome on reducing immunosuppression and improving the recovery rate from COVID-19. NGL will incorporate these criteria in developing a safe, stable, and readily available acylated chitosan encapsulated vitamin D, beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids (C20:4n6, C:225n3, C:226n3) and odd chain fatty acids (C15:0, C17:0), and antioxidants (α-tocopherol and β-carotene) incorporated nanoparticle (NP) oral supplement “CoViRCureTM” to prevent the COVID-19 post-hyper immunity period of immunosuppression. In Phase I, we will collect COVID-19 serum samples to determine the target compounds for CoViRCure. During infection, fatty acid metabolism changes due to fighting off inflammation, oxidation, or injury. Metabolic changes include the increased production of oxylipins (oxl) and ceramide (Crm) species, along with decreased levels of beneficial sphingolipids (SLs). We will measure the proposed dietary compounds along with oxl, CRm, and SLs in COVID-19 serum. Collectively, these lipid markers will enable us to select the active target compounds, which modulate the S1PR pathway to restore normal homeostasis in the body after injury or infection. NGL will focus on selecting the most promising markers for metabolic changes in the proposed dietary compounds found in COVID-19 patient’s serum. Furthermore, NGL will determine the target compounds for the fabrication of CoViRCure to prevent COVID-19 hyper immunity and immunosuppression in the military and civilian populations.less","166,442",2020,2021

0,RADIUS: Reliable and Adaptive Decision makIng under Uncertainty for Spectrum access,United States Department of the Air Force,to Yi Shi,"ABSTRACT: Intelligent Automation Inc. proposes to design a robust decision making and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) system for satellite communications under uncertainty. Our system integrates various types of uncertainty caused by environment, regulation, uncontrollable user effects, and prediction. We will first develop methods to quantify the uncertainty by either individual observation or collaborative approach. This approach includes statistical modeling of spectrum dynamics and prediction under various sources of uncertainty in communications systems. We will then design reaction strategies that are robust or opportunistic to uncertainty, or can leverage uncertainty by anticipation. We will wrap these strategies in reliable DSA algorithms to manage and mitigate uncertainty, which can be based on either offline stochastic optimization or online algorithms. We will study the performance, complexity and overhead of the designed algorithms via in-depth analysis, simulation or emulation under realistic communications models. In particular, our approach will integrate uncertainty quantification and uncertainty mitigation in common system architecture. We will identify the optimal conditions and use cases for each algorithm and integrate them in an adaptive algorithm that switches between offline and online algorithms in the system. BENEFIT: We have identified the Air Force Satellite Control Networks, Air Force Space Networks, and Airborne Networks as the initial application/primary market for this technology. The proposed stochastic optimization and robust game theory approach enables holistic understanding of how to efficiently utilize the limited spectrum in a satellite network with uncertainty. Such insights will benefit various applications including space situational awareness, resource allocation, and network adaptation. The proposed solution has tremendous potential in military applications regarding space and airborne networks, such as Space Command, potentially supporting a number of major programs like Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), Airborne Networks Program, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, Future Combat System (FCS), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT), NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) program, UHF Follow-On (UFO) program, and Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program. As a whole, the proposed effort has great potential to enhance DSA in satellite networks. Such insights are directly beneficial to various satellite systems with respect to space situational awareness, resource allocation, and ensuring highly efficient spectrum access in terms of accuracy, delay, throughput, and overhead. For the proposed optimization framework, there exist a variety of commercial applications including satellite communications, GPS, anti-jam, global coverage tracking/data acquisition services, wireless networks, and vehicle networks.

Some of these cellular behaviors have now been confirmed by our MURI team and other labs in vitro. One critical question remains to be answered- can such spatiotemporal regulation of cell signaling at the cell population level be achieved in vivo. This request for DURIP support for an imaging system upgrade will enable us to answer this question and update our parental MURI to allow in vivo control and visualization.

0,Time-Frequency Feature Extraction from Nonstationary Multiple Time Series and its Applications,United States Department of the Navy,to NAOKI SAITO,"A central question of time-frequency analysis is how to decompose a signal with timevarying oscillatory properties into several components with distinct amplitude and frequency behaviors. The time-frequency characteristics of the input signal visualized by the popular spectrogram are often too blurred to decompose the signal reliably into a finite sum of amplitude-phase components and extract the instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF) of each component. We propose to use the so-called Synchrosqueezing transform (SST) to sharpen the spectrogram for reliable retrieval of IAs and IFs of an input signal, which allows us to analyze and interpret each component separately. However, the current SST theory has several limitations when dealing with real nonstationary signals including sonar signals and music recordings, which often have strongly modulated/discontinuous IAs and/or highly-varying IFs. In order to mitigate them, we will investigate the use of more adaptive time-frequency representations in the SST, e.g., the quilted Gabor transform, the Chirplet transform, and the prolate spheroidal wave functions. As applications of our tools, we propose to analyze sonar recordings and separate out the acoustic waves reflected or emitted by man-made objects from other unwanted sounds (e.g., whale clicks, ambient noise, etc.), which should help the Navy’s effort on Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). In addition, we propose to develop and test a procedure to map each amplitude-phase component in the data to a sequence of musical notes and assign a synthetic musical instrument so that we can hear and characterize the data with our own auditory system, a process known as “data sonification.” For this purpose, we plan to use temperature measurements made at different depths of a lake for aquatic ecosystem studies.less","150,000",2016,2017

0,Identifying compounds that increase mitochondrial performance,United States Department of the Army,to Gino Cortopassi,"The objective of this proposal is to isolate drugs that will enhance human physical and cognitive performance and resilience to trauma through enhancement of mitochondrial function. The significance of this opportunity is to reduce biological constraints on the modern army. Smaller, faster-moving fighting forces are constrained by physical endurance, which in turn is directly related to number and efficiency of muscle mitochondria. Additionally, mitochondrial function declines with age, contributing to the age-related loss of physical and cognitive performance. Experienced soldiers are forced to retire because of these losses of performance. Finally, field trauma leads to tissue death when metabolic reserves are insufficient. We have modified a high-throughput cell-based assay to sensitively monitor mitochondrial function, and will use this assay to screen for compounds increasing mitochondrial performance, through increased proliferation or increased electron transfer. We demonstrate that the assay detects a known mitoproliferation drug, and will optimize the assay for screening in 96 and 384-well plates in Phase I. In Phase II multiple drug and natural compound libraries will be screened, and mito-active drugs identified.

Unfortunately, the techniques currently used to treating conductance are computationally expensive, and modeling real systems accurately has been a challenge. We propose to tackle this problem by developing new and more effective algorithms and exploring new computer architectures. Research at UC-Davis has yielded a technique (Tunneling Current, TC, theory) for efficient calculation of conductance in complex molecules and nano-structures. In addition, PetaChem, LLC now maintains quantum chemistry code (TeraChem) designed for graphical processing units (GPUs) that calculates electronic structure in systems as large as 2000 atoms using DFT. Our Phase I effort will focus on combining these two advances to improve the reliability of theoretical modeling for nano-electronic devices. Specifically, TC theory will be tested for its accuracy in modeling conductance in metal-molecule-metal junctions, and results will be compared to those from RT-TDDFT. Algorithms suitable for GPU implementation of TC theory will then be derived. Our Phase II product will be computer software that allows both TC and RT-TDDFT calculations and executes on GPU platforms. BENEFIT: The product of the proposed STTR effort, after Phase II, is a computer software module that would allow for the efficient and accurate prediction of the linear and non-linear optical response of materials.

0,Tunable High Quality Factor Radio Frequency Filters,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Alexei Smirnov,"In this STTR project, RadiaBeam Technologies and UC Davis will develop an innovative, compact, durable, high unloaded Q (>1000), microwave filter. The filter will be tunable over a wide band (>2 octaves), and can be configured in a bank of filters to cover the range of 20 MHz to 30 GHz. The filter design proposed will be less susceptible to creep-related frequency drift, and promises very long life time, as the tuner is free from static stress. The filter can use simplified frequency control, as it does not need high voltage or energy to retain any given fixed frequency profile. In Phase I, the electromagnetic design of the filter will be optimized, and the closed loop control and voltage supply needed to retain the frequency state will be considered. Detailed simulations will be performed to show tunable performance and applicability for a wide range of military and commercial waveforms.less","99,937",2012,2012

0,Additive Manufacturing for Microwave Vacuum Electron Device Cost Reduction,United States Department of the Navy,to Pedro Frigola,"The Department of the Navy has a need for the development of an additive manufacturing (AM) process for key vacuum electronic device components to meet on-demand, flexible, and affordable manufacturing requirements. The developed manufacturing method has a potential to reduce cost of vacuum electronics by as much as 70% as well as simplify and hence expedite production process of these devices by eliminating braze joints and thus also improve reliability.

0,Reduction of Soft Tissue Injuries and Down Days with Female-Specific Collagen Intervention,United States Department of the Air Force,to Miguel Zeran,"Momentous seeks to deliver a joint health intervention designed specifically for female military servicemembers. It maximizes the benefit of collagen and vitamin C for injury reduction with novel additionals to limit increased injury risk due to the physiological impacsex-specificcific hormones. This effort will adapt the composition of Momentous Collagen Shot, a leading collagen product, to meet the military-specific use case of female-specific joint health. The design adds ingredients to counteract joint laxity seen during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Momentous’ solution promotes collagen synthesis, deposition, and matrix building alongside tendon and ligament strength and bone density improvement. Across the US military, lower extremity overuse injuries are the leading cause of being medically not ready for duty, as well as lost and limited duty days. MSKI is the leading source of down days causing 25 million limited duty days DoD-wide annually resulting in 2.4 million doctor visits and accounting for $548 million in direct patient care cost (Teyhen et al., 2018). The military is constantly looking to develop new and innovative ways to improve the human performance and well-being of its servicemembers. Unfortunately, many of these solutions are not one-size-fits-all, especially regarding women. Women participating in the same sports as men suffer 2-8 times more catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI)  than men (Larruskain et al. 2018; Waldén et al. 2011). A female servicemember is 2X more likely to suffer an MSKI than her male counterpart (Grimm et al., 2019). Of the 62,489 active USAF Security Forces duty personnel from 2009 to 2018, 40,771 (65.2%) were diagnosed with at least one musculoskeletal injury, where women had a 31% higher injury rate than men (Sundstrom et al., 2021). According to Rhon, Greenly, et al. (2021), females in the military have up to 3 times greater risk of sustaining lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries than their male counterparts and while women make up only 15% of the military population, they are 40% of military patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. Most injury reduction interventions seek to make a person stronger, change their posture or gait, or increase their range of motion. However, female servicemembers face two unique unmet challenges: (1) a lack of consideration for increased joint laxity, and subsequent increase in injury risk, as seen during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and (2) a complete absence of female-specific interventions.  The team of collaborators joining Momentous includes among others: the world’s #1 collagen researcher, Keith Baar (Ph.D., Professor of Molecular Exercise Physiology, UC Davis). The RDT&E includes phases for product design, clinical research, manufacturing, and acceptance testing.

0,Environment-Aware Security System,United States Department of the Navy,to Todd Heberlein,"When intrusion detection systems were first being developed in the 1980s and early 1990s (1) actual attacks were extremely rare, (2) only a small number of vulnerabilities were typically known at any given time, (3) few important systems were connected toopen networks, (4) the variety of interactions and interdependencies between processes and systems were limited and (5) the largest open network, the Internet, was relatively small. Today, all this has changed, and because of the change, we shouldreconsider the role of monitoring in our information systems. We propose a radical system design that repositions sensors from the role of detecting and responding to attacks to the role of predicting and preparing for attacks. Furthermore, byintegrating information on control surfaces, system dependencies, a unifying ontology, and identifying power-law properties in the network, we can dramatically increase the inherent security of a site. Our proposed Environment-Aware Security Systemchanges the role of monitoring from a detect and respond role to a predict and prepare role. The end result is that the entire network is significantly more robust to attacks from outsiders, insiders, and automated attacks such as worms. Since securing asystem is much less expensive than recovering from an attack, such an approach is considerably more cost effective for an organization. And since the entire system is considerably more robust, the probability that an attack will affect mission criticaloperations is dramatically reduced.less","69,998",2002,2003

It would revolutionize much of computational mathematics, since it impacts a wide range of algorithms and applications, and is thus particularly relevant for very large scale computations. An O(n2 log n) algorithm for matrix multiplication could have an impact on science and technology of the 21st century that is comparable to the enormous impact of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the 20th century.

0,Exploring sandpile cascades on oscillator networks,United States Department of the Army,to Raissa D'Souza,"Problem overview: Cascading failures are a hallmark of complex systems and the BTW sandpile model of cascading dynamics forms a cornerstone for our understanding of such failures in systems ranging from avalanches and forest fires to electric power grids and brain networks. The latter two are systems of tremendous practical importance, more so they are examples of oscillator networks. Yet, the BTW model does not account for this. Hence there is a crucial need to understand the interplay between the oscillatory and sandpile dynamics to identify the range of new failure mechanisms and opportunities to enhance system performance and develop novel control interventions for the broad range of systems that have both oscillatory and cascading dynamics. Goals: In this project we propose to lay the foundation for understanding SOC sandpile cascades on networks of oscillators. The goals are: (1) to discover and analyze the new emergent behaviors that arise from the interactions; (2) to understand how the oscillator nodal dynamics impact the distribution of sandpiles; and (3) to identify parameters that we can tune to influence the cascading dynamics and potential local intervention strategies to control the cascades. Approach: Our focus is on coupling the quintessential model of cascades, the BTW model, to the quintessential model of synchronization, the Kuramoto model on a network system. Thus each node in the network is an oscillator with a particular natural frequency that has capacity to handle a certain amount of load. The load is modeled as discrete grains of sand that arrive on nodes chosen uniformly at random. Once the load on a node exceeds its capacity, the node ""topples"" and sheds its load to neighbors who may in-turn topple and so on. There are several natural choices for coupling together the dynamics. Inspired by electric power networks, where synchronization between elements is of fundamental importance, it is natural to lower the sand carrying capacity of nodes that are out of synchronization with their neighbors, as they are more susceptible to failure. When a node does topple the simplest scenario is that it sheds its load to neighbors and its capacity is subsequently fully restored with its phase reset at random. Our preliminary work shows that this leads to long-time oscillatory behavior with a long and desirable build-up phase where oscillators are fully synchronized and cascades are largely avoided, but ultimately the system reaches a tipping point where, in contrast to the BTW model, a large cascade triggers an even larger cascade, leading to a ""cascade of cascades"" dragon king event, after which the system has a short transient dynamic that restores full synchrony and returns the system to the build-up stage. The frequency of the long-term oscillations is much less than the natural frequency of the oscillators, introducing a new emergent timescale and long-range order in the system, opening opportunities for self-organized interventions and control. We will also explore a slightly more complicated combination of the BTW and Kuramoto models accounting for inertia. Here when a node gains more load its natural frequency slows down, and as it sheds load, its natural frequency speeds up. This dampens the long-time oscillations described above and leads to novel phenomena that we are currently mapping out including reducing large cascades. We will use a combination of numerical simulation and analytic treatment using branching processes and generating functions. In preliminary work we have developed the numerical studies to establish the behavior of the first model and the analytic treatment to predict the frequency of the long-term oscillations and cascade size distributions.less","60,000",2023,2023
0,NETWORK-BASED NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS OF HUMAN TRUST DYNAMICS WHEN TEAMED WITH AUTONOMY,United States Air Force,to ZHAODAN KONG,"First, the proposed equipment will interface with our existing facilities and upgrade other equipment available for research at the Cyber-human-physical Systems (CHPS) Lab (directed by Dr. Zhaodan Kong) at UC Davis and the Bioastronautics Lab (with Dr. Allison Anderson and Dr. Torin Clark as core faculty members) at CU Boulder. In the CHPS Lab, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists and engineers bring innovative control theory, formal methods, and machine learning solutions to engineer and understand collaborative and assured autonomy. The lab houses a wide range of aerial and ground robots, e.g., Parrot AR.Drone 2.0, 3DR Solo, Crazyflie 2.0, and Pololu m3pi. The lab also houses several ground truth sensing systems, e.g., a 6DOF OptiTrack motion capturing system, SensoMotoric Instruments eye-tracking glasses, and multiple Emotive Epoc+ EEG headsets. An Emotiv headset has only 14 channels, meaning that it offers a rather low spatial resolution. A research-grade EEG with more channels, such as the proposed g.HIamp- RESEARCH, is needed to enhance the quality of the lab. In the Bioastronautics Lab, research focuses on measuring and mitigating human performance decrements in extreme operational environments. The laboratory houses several aircraft and spacecraft simulators. The Aerospace Research Simulator (AReS) will be leveraged by this project for human-in-the-loop evaluations. The AReS consists of two operator stations, 6 monitor interfaces, including 3 touchscreens, and multiple input manipulators (e.g., hand controllers, foot pedals, button presses). The group has existing psychophysiological monitoring hardware, such as the Biopac MP160 data acquisition unit and modules to wirelessly record heart rate variability (electrocardiogram (EKG)), respiration rate (chest strap), and electrodermal activity (EDA, finger-mounted sensors). The lab also has an Pupil Labs eye tracker currently used for display design and workload evaluation. The proposed fNIRS and EEG NIRSport2 hardware will improve our ability to quantify neurophysiological response to compliment our current hardware and improve estimates of human state. Second, the proposed equipment will enable our collaborative team to establish new research capabilities and work on the following new research project. The two labs will share the two proposed devices during the duration of this project (see Sec. 4.1 for details on how they will be used in our proposed project). Upon the completion of the project, the g.HIamp-RESEARCH headset will be housed at the CHPS Lab and the NIRSport 2 headset will be housed at the Bioastronautics Lab.

Two main mechanisms were proposed: (1) Grain boundary strengthening by grain boundary energy decrease; and (2) Polarization of grain boundaries by utilizing electric fields. Despite the short period of the project, we were able to stress the first mechanism and demonstrate its efficacy in increasing toughness of zirconia by about 20%. This opens a new research frontier that shall be explored in other oxides. Moreover, we could address the second mechanism, which should that although polarization can be induced by electric fields in the complex oxide MgAl2O4, the resulting effect on mechanical properties is too small. The results are consolidated in 1 submitted paper, and 4 other manuscripts in preparation (one already at near-submission stage). Note that in the context of the very short time available to accomplish this project (9 months), we consider this a great achievement.

Samaniego, Distinguished Research Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Davis, has had continuous research support from the Army Research Office from 1999 Ð 2016. The present proposal to the ARO seeks support for one year, via a STTR, grant for the purpose of continuing Dr. SamaniegoÕs research work in three specific problem areas. (1) Investigations are proposed aimed at identifying uniformly optimal communication networks with respect to the stochastic precedence ordering. The proposal reviews recent work extending the findings in McAssey and Samaniego (2014) and proposes to develop further extensions as well as to investigate the connection between optimal network reliability and the Òdegree distributionsÓ of all networks of a given size, i.e., with a fixed number of vertices and edges; (2) The estimation of component reliability based on system failure-time data will be investigated using nonparametric Bayesian methods; (3) A collection of open problems in comparative statistical inference will be investigated. Specifically, the comparison of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to the testing of statistical hypotheses will be undertaken. Motivated by the results of a large simulation study based on published data from Òthe word-length experimentÓ, Dr. Samaniego and his colleagues will focus on the development of a mathematical framework from which definitive results may be obtained regarding the circumstances in which Bayes tests are superior (or conversely, inferior) to classical (frequentist) tests such as Neyman-Pearson or likelihood ratio tests.

0,"Development of Bioacoustic Tools for Long-Term, Non-Invasive Monitoring of Threatened and Endangered Birds",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Brenda McCowan,"Birds that live within visually obscured environments, such as aquatic, arboreal, and nocturnal species, are dependent upon acoustic communication to find mates, care for young, hold territories, and defend themselves from predators. Such species are inherently hard to observe visually and thus monitor, but they may readily be studied acoustically. Although acoustic surveys have been conducted for many years to obtain estimates of bird density, long-term population trends and life-history parameters could not be collected because individual identities of calling birds were not known. For some species, however, individual recognition by voice is feasible. In these cases, individual vocal recognition could be an efficient and noninvasive tool for tracking population trends, analogous to photographic identification of large mammals. Quantitative bioacoustic techniques can be used to determine whether individuals’ vocalizations can be used to obtain individual signature information. These ‘acoustic fingerprints’ already have been found in several avian and mammalian species, and evidence has been documented for an acoustic basis of kin discrimination in some species. Acoustic fingerprints have not been applied as a long-term censusing tool in birds as yet, but recent advances in computing hardware and signal processing have made the approach feasible. A species that is well suited for long-term acoustic monitoring is the Mexican spotted owl (), one of the Department of Defense's priority species.The objective of this project was to develop quantitative bioacoustic techniques for use in monitoring population densities and trends, as well as assessing the effects of military training and other anthropogenic activities on the population dynamics of threatened and endangered birds, specifically the Mexican spotted owl.less",Summarize,,
0,"Methods for Assessment of Species Richness and Occupancy across Space, Time, Taxonomic Groups, and Ecoregions",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Erica Fleishman,"This project aimed to develop and evaluate practical methods to estimate species richness and occupancy of diverse taxonomic groups across space and time and in diverse ecosystems. As reflected in the statement of need to which this project responded, this work is relevant to the needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) to assess and monitor native species and to evaluate the potential effects of land use and management actions on native species. Species richness, or the number of native species, is a common surrogate measure of ecosystem status. Occupancy, the probability that a given location is occupied by a species, can serve as a surrogate measure of the species’ abundance, which in turn is related to probability of persistence.This project addressed five major objectives consistent with the primary aim. First, researchers assessed relations between environmental variables and species richness at nested spatial extents. Second, they developed guidelines for periodicity of sampling. Third, they tested methods for estimating species richness of multiple taxonomic groups on the basis of spatial variation in occurrence or heterogeneity of one group. Fourth, they examined the extent to which occupancy could provide a foundation for measuring species richness. Fifth, they investigated potential responses of species richness and occupancy to manageable environmental changes, and meaningful scales of sampling for detection of biological effects of environmental change.less",2012,‐,

After the initial screening, one building will be chosen for retrofit duct sealing and/or envelope sealing. Finally, the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning(HVAC) energy use of the chosen building will be measured before and after the retrofit to determine the overall energy savings due to air sealing.
