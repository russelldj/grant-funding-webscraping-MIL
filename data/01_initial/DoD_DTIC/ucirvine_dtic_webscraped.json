        "abstract": "There have been numerous incidences of organophosphate (OP) nerve agents such as sarin (GB) being used as weapons, representing a significant threat to warfighters and civilians. Immediate effects of exposure can include seizures, respiratory distress and death (1). Beyond those first minutes, or following lower dose exposures, there is increased risk for brain injury that may progressively worsen for months post-exposure without resolution. (1). Collectively these CNS outcomes of OP exposure impact the long-term quality of life (QOL) for victims and could represent an immense burden on the VA health care system. Our recent DTRA-funded rodent studies suggest that adenosine augmentation effectively mitigates cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation elicited following irradiation, outcomes similar to those observed following OP exposure (preliminary data and 2,3). Our project, responsive to Thrust Area 7-Fundamental Science for Chemical and Biological Defense, develops a novel adenosine-based, neuroprotective countermeasure to combat adverse CNS outcomes following GB exposure. Our lead compound ABT-702, an adenosine kinase (ADK) inhibitor, is an orally available, potent, well-tolerated drug that can be stockpiled for emergencies. The principles by which this compound acts are approved by the FDA or are in phase I clinical trials for other applications (4). Our milestones will establish the impact of acute GB exposure on the CNS and the efficacy of ABT-702 to protect against or mitigate the adverse effects of OP exposure.less",

All of the projects of this proposal focus on aspects of trauma and critical care assessment and management, and have defined deliverables in terms of a device and/or procedure that addresses JFHP capability gaps. Project 1 will develop a non-invasive wearable sensor to provide continuous physiologic information in order to optimize stabilization and treatment strategies during and beyond the Golden Hour of battlefield injury. Project 2 will develop wearable hemodynamic and metabolic sensors for critical care assessment and monitoring of lactate and other hemodynamic markers. Project 3\u2019s goal is to develop a flow-enhanced modification of pulse oximetry for improved performance in far-forward field conditions. Project 4 will develop a durable, compact blood coagulation analyzer for real-time coagulation assessment. Project 5 will further develop, enhance, and expand our patented and now commercially available tissue viability surgical camera to quantitatively and non-invasively assess directed energy burns, thermal burns over large surface areas, and assess burn interventions using wide-field functional imaging. Project 6 will expand the development of functional OCT to add airway compliance and ciliary function capabilities to the characterization of inhalation airway injury. The goal of Project 7 is the further development and validation of a hand-held, point-of-care wound infection and biofilm imaging device. Project 8 will focus on developing an in vitro assay system for structural and functional mechanisms of traumatic brain (TBI) and spinal cord injury. Projects 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 involve collaborative efforts with research groups at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR). In addition to the eight projects, this proposal also includes funds for administrative core support that provides service to all of the individual projects. All of the projects involve filing of intellectual property rights for patent protection, and/or a commercialization plan.

Conventional vaccine approaches are less effective for providing protection against multiple variant antigens (Ags), particularly when administered in a single dose. In this multidisciplinary application, that combines immunologists, chemists, pharmaceutical and biochemical engineers, we propose to develop a single-shot formulation platform, using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) variants (H1, H5, H7) as a model Ag, followed by filovirus glycoprotein (GP) variant Ags from Marburg and Ebola (species Zaire and Sudan) viruses. Each variant will be delivered in a different delivery vehicle designed for non-synchronous Ag-release in vivo. These vehicles will comprise lipid-based nanoparticles, protein-based nanoparticles, and microspheres, and modified with toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8-agonist for increased adjuvanticity. Antibody (Ab) crossreactivity will be evaluated on HA and GP variant protein microarrays, and affinity maturation confirmed by affinity measurements in sera, and by Ab V-gene sequencing. Cross-reactivity of anti-HA antibodies will also be evaluated in vivo for protection against challenge with heterologous influenza strains. This platform (Fig. 1), we call Affinity Maturation of Antibody by Non-synchronous Delivery of Antigen (AMANDA), can be applied to other variant pathogens of relevance to the warfighter.less",

Project CBM-V-01\u201d (HDTRA1-16-C-0009). We use a proteome microarray containing all 2000 proteins from the Q fever agent Coxiella burnetii to discover better vaccine antigens, and novel multi-TLR agonist conjugates to boost immune responses. This project uses a 2 dose, Prime & Boost immunization regimen. In response to the DTRA Topic G11 announcement \u201cCritical Requirements for Effective Single Dose Vaccine\u201d, we will construct and screen an assortment of nanoparticulate and biodegradable microsphere formulations with different physical properties that release antigen and TLR agonists at different rates. By mixing nanoparticles and biodegradable microspheres with different antigen release kinetics we aim to accomplish the Prime & Boost after a single injection. The nanoparticles are also designed to target antigen to the draining lymph node for improved vaccine efficacy. We will use diverse resources and personnel from our institution to accomplish the objectives of this new multidisciplinary proposal. Novel TLR agonists formulated in liposomes, nanoparticles and microspheres will be synthesized in the chemistry department. Vaccine formulations will be developed and characterized in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Chemistry Departments. Advanced immunoimaging resources in our Stem Cell Research Center will be used to determine bioavailability and track delivery of vaccine into the draining lymph node. Immunogenicity studies will be conducted in the Institute for Immunology and Flow Cytometry Facility. Our model vaccine antigen for this project is from Coxiella burnetii a biological weapon. We will utilize an in vivo mouse Immunogenicity Pipeline to evaluate the intensity and duration of the adaptive T- and B-cell mediated immune responses induced by these cpVLPs.

This specifically includes changes in timed behavior, important in the operation of embedded systems such as digital control systems. The results of this project will be useful for providing such assurance for a range of applications of localized binary modification.  In addition to SFE, these include patching bugs or removing possible execution paths (e.g., removing application features), or instrumenting binaries to gather run-time information for further testing and analysis.

        "abstract": "We propose a next-generation survivable system architecture that integrates redundant execution approaches from the domain of dependable systems with moving target defense techniques and cyber deception concepts from the domain of cyber security. As an added bonus, our approach provides novel defenses against exploits that target hardware flaws, including microarchitectural side channels. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of the first three that we are proposing here is an entirely novel approach that hasn't been tried before, and the fourth characteristic makes it even more compelling.In the proposed architecture, every server is a true moving-target NVX system and is simultaneously also a honeypot. Our main idea is that instead of terminating execution when a variant in a multi-variant execution is compromised by an attacker, the compromised variant is instead peeled off the joint computation and turned into a dynamic honeypot instance instead, while the surviving variants re-constitute and continue operating.Moreover, our approach significantly increases the mutual dissimilarity of the simultaneously executing variants by allowing the different versions to run on heterogeneous hardware; specifically, on both x86 and ARM at the same time. In order to totally subvert such a system, an attacker would need to craft an attack that simultaneously compromises both an ARM-based and an x86-based system using the identical inputs, and potentially do this while both the x86-based and the ARM-based variants themselves are constantly mutating as a moving-target defense. It is also highly unlikely that a hardware flaw such as a microarchitectural side channel would manifest itself in the same manner across two completely different processor architectures, so that an NVX system executing across different ISAs provides a natural defense against attacks that rely on such side channels. For example, it is outright impossible to mount a Rowhammer attack on memory cells that are not co-located on the same machine. If successful, our approach will set the bar to attackers significantly higher than all existing defense techniques that we are aware of, either implemented or proposed.The most important advantage of our proposed approach is that it doesn't require a human specialer to obtain the desired resilience gains. While existing approaches to retrofitting security onto legacy software, including current approaches of introducing heterogeneity, have been quite effective, they typically require substantial source code understanding and manual source code adaptation. Theproposed solution requires source code, but operates on such source code automatically.Our plan is to perform the research and build the infrastructure so that such cyberdeceptive NVX systems can be generated automatically from the source code of an ordinary server application. As part of our research plan, we propose to build a fully functioning prototype of the proposed system at scale. That system will take an existing server application, such as the Nginx web server, and then automatically instantiate it into a cyber-deceptive NVX system. Ourresearch will also conduct a comprehensive and objective evaluation of our approach and produce clear and concise metrics of its performance. Lastly, all software developed under this project will be released as open source.If successful, our project will go a long way towards increasing the survivability of networked systems, while simultaneously shifting the economies of cyber warfare in favor of defenders by raising the cost of an attack for the adversary.Approved for Public Releaseless",

        "abstract": "Systems software can be tricked into performing unintended computation by feeding it carefully crafted inputs that corrupt and leak internal state. Modern software is so complex that implementation defects, some of which are exploitable, will only be discovered in the field. Operating systems isolate the state of each process such that a program experiencing an error does not bring down the entire system. There is no separation between libraries inside a single process, however. This has become a problem as applications grow more complex and defects in unrelated components can be combined freely into a weird machine performing unintended, malicious computations. As a result, several large applications have switched to a multi-process design. The idea is to reduce the \u201cblast radius\u201d of malicious inputs by i) processing untrusted inputs in a sandboxed process with few privileges and ii) performing privileged operations in a separate, higher privileged process. The application of multi-process designs is unfortunately limited by the substantial additional developer effort required to re-architect large and complex code bases such that costly inter-process interactions and marshaling of data does not lead to unacceptable slow downs. We propose an easy-to-use and efficient compartmentalization scheme that leverages a new memory management feature in x86 processors. The approach is easy to use because it does not require developers to split their application into multiple processes. Instead, programmers will use annotations to map libraries and executables to a set of compartments. When the application is built, we will automatically insert call gates on call edges that cross compartments thus reducing the programmer burden. Call gates implement compartment switches without assistance from the kernel and are therefore more efficient than full context switches from one process to another. Programmers are required to declare their intent to share certain data between compartments; this again requires less effort than marshaling data between processes. The compartmentalization substrate allocates data based on whether it is shared between compartments or private to a single compartment. We will provide tools that help programmers insert the necessary sharing annotations and diagnose segmentation faults triggered by accesses to the private memory of another compartment.   The proposed work builds on the encouraging results obtained during the Phase I effort. The experimental design of Phase I relied on a customized Rust compiler to compartmentalize applications. A major goal of Phase II is the ability to compartmentalize applications without the need to use a custom compartment-aware compiler to facilitate deployability. Other key improvements include the ability to support more compartmentalization models and deployments scenarios.less",

We will deliver (i) a computational strategy for optimal design of LPBF-fabricated functionally graded shell-metamaterials that are far superior to traditional truss-based lattices, and (ii) a fabrication approach that allows local control of plastic deformation mechanisms in 17-4 PH steel thin-wall structures. While LPBF is an ideal technique for fabrication of lattice materials for critical structural applications, we argue that existing lattice designs have not taken advantage of two unique benefitsof this additive manufacturing process: (i) the ability to fabricate almost arbitrarily complextopologies and (ii) the opportunity to locally tailor the mechanical properties of the constituent material. The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to develop the scientific understanding in metallurgy, mechanics and topology optimization that is required to realize these advances and develop physically heterogeneous shell-metamaterials with unprecedented combinations of properties. Building upon exceptional results recently demonstrated by the PI on the mechanical efficiency of shell and plate-based metamaterials, we propose to: (1) fully elucidate the interplays among processing parameters, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties in LPBF-processedshell-metamaterials using a combination of numerical and experimental techniques, and establish effective processing windows; (2) harness these complex interplays to locally control martensite/austenite ratio and precipitate formation to either eliminate or amplify property gradients across the build; (3) combine mechanical models with experiments to achieve a full mechanistic understanding of the non-linear deformation and failure behavior of these shell-based metamaterials; (4) capitalize on the extensive (experimentally driven) database to infer, through the application of data analytics, property uncertainty and gradation models as well as their as sociated length scales and (5) develop novel non-linear stochastic topology optimization algorithms that benefit from fully validated models of the mechanics to id LPBF process. To demonstrate the power of this novel design/fabrication approach for DoD-relevant applications,r we will develop shell-metamaterials with optimal specific energy absorption under large plastic deformation, by ensuring simultaneous progression of plasticity throughout the material. Importantly, this cannot be achieved by traditional optimization of the metamaterial architecture, but requires local tuning of the yield strength and the strain hardening behavior of the material. By assembling a highly interdisciplinary team across three universities, with expertise in metallurgy, processing science, additive manufacturing, mechanical behavior of metamaterials,stochastic modeling and topology optimization, we will guarantee that the impact of this project extend well beyond the field of mechanical metamaterials. Elucidating the science underlying local microstructural control in PH steels fabricated by LPBF will dramatically affect the additive manufacturing of structural and functional materials for nearly any DoD application; at the sametime, establishing novel computational design processes, where the marriage between geometrical complexity (e.g. 3D shell-based topologies) and local property control provides a significantly wider design space, is expected to leapfrog the field of additively manufactured metamaterials in a variety of DoD applications.less",

        "abstract": "People routinely organize the flow of events into distinct episodes when dealing with the complexity of dynamic environments. Such episodic memories incorporate information about the identity of items, their spatial locations, and the order in which they occurred(#what#, #where#, and #when#). Understanding how the cortical telencephalon processes episodes is thus a basic issue in contemporary neuroscience and one that is central to the development of autonomous systems that can deal with the real world. The hippocampus is critical for acquisition and retrieval of episodic memories but there are no models relating the components and operations of the structure to the multiple and diverse aspects of this singularly rich form of encoding. This in large part reflects a surprising absence of information about input/output relationships of the primary hippocampal circuit. However, studies in this program showed that signals from entorhinal cortex generate a two-part response in the output stage of hippocampus (field CA1) that is triggered by dual sub-circuits. Signals are routed through the two pathways according to the frequency of the arriving cortical pulses. Our studieshave also identified novel filters and amplifiers throughout the complex circuit along with a potent excitatory feedback system that is critical to throughput. Finally, we were able to show that certain of these subsystems are essential to acquisition of the #what, #where#, and #when# elements of an episode. These results enabled the construction of realistic simulations to address specific issues but there are major issues that prevented the development of a model capable of generating the diverse aspects of episodic memory. The proposed work addresses these problems. The first goal is to describe circuit responses to input from the spatial subdivision of the entorhinal cortex alone, or in combination with the non-spatial subdivision (the latter has been used in our studies to date). Our second goal is to identify the cellular mechanisms that underlie the unusual low pass filter in the CA3 field: studies will test proposed roles for feedforward inhibition from somatostatin-positive interneurons. Other Aim 2 studies will determine if field CA2 acts as an intermediary filter between CA3 and CA1. The third set of studies will test the influence of modulatory inputs, with special emphasis on the cholinergic afferents, on frequency filtering, amplification and feedback within the hippocampal circuit. Studies addressing the second the third goals make use of powerful chemo- and opto- genetic approaches to selectively manipulate specific cell types and afferents. The activity patterns and rhythms typically present in hippocampus are known to produce learning-related change in synaptic strength and a realistic model will accordingly require information on changes in circuit function arising from such plasticity. Thus, the fourth goal is to test for activity-induced changes in synaptic function at specific nodes # thisstudy will constitute a first test for circuit level plasticity. The final goal is to build a model of primary hippocampal circuitfunctions. These studies, to be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Richard Granger (Dartmouth) will both integrate the disparate operations of the circuit into the model and be used to develop hypotheses about how these operations relate to the processing of episodic memory.

        "abstract": "Ultra-fast measurements of the frequency of a microwave transmission is a vital task for many military applications including interception and jamming of signals used in communications, radar detection and remote control of weapons. The rapid tracking of adversarial frequency-agile microwave signals allows one to swiftly identify threats, such as radar-guided anti-tank missiles, and undertake appropriate counter-measures in real time, thus substantially increasing the safety of ground vehicles, and assuring superiority of the US battlefield forces in the microwave domain. These vehicle-protection tasks demand ultra-fast (microsecond time scale) measurements of adversarial external microwave signal frequencies in order to neutralize threats in real time. These vital goal can be achieved using recent advances in spintronics technology, where electron spin is used for microwave signal detection instead of electron charge. This technology is ideal for a new type of nano-sized and radiation-hard devices for the ultra-fast detection of  low-power microwave signals. Three key advantages of this technology based on spin transfer torque and tunneling magnetoresistance effects in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) over existing semiconductor technology are: higher sensitivity, which enables detection of adversarial microwave signals over longer distances, and, thus, provides early threat warning higher speed allowing for tracking of frequency-agile signals at the microsecond time scale radiation hardness In the course of our current STTR Phase II Program under the contract # W56HZV-18-C-0026, we developed a spintronic frequency detector based on an array of six MTJs and working in the microwave frequency S band (2 \u2013 4 GHz). The proposed Sequential Phase II STTR Research Program significantly advances the technology developed in Phase II of the Program via: the use of novel spintronic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that increase the detector frequency to the microwave X band (8 \u2013 12 GHz) relevant to anti-radar applications implementation of software-defined advanced adversarial signal analysis via integration with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) We will also reduce the SWAP detector parameters down to 3\u201dx3\u201dx1\u201d size, 0.3 kg weight and 100 mW power. We will implement an automatic FPGA-based capability to separate the adversarial frequency-agile signals from multiple innocuous and noise signals, based on the temporal dependence of these signals. This feature will enable operation of the detector under electromagnetic interference (EMI) in realistic battlefield and urban environments. Our goal is to develop fully automated power-efficient spintronic microwave detectors. These detectors will measure, digitize and analyze the X-band spectrum, and will rapidly provide information on adversarial signals to the ground vehicle digital electronics systems, enabling swift implementation of the appropriate counter-measures.less",

        "abstract": "Modeling a wide range of physical processes relies on solving complex partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Example applications include predicting crack propagation in underwater vehicles or controlling dissipated heat in microprocessors that are cooled with turbulent flows. While significant advancements have been made in solving such PDEs, existing technologies are prohibitively expensive. The costs are especially high in the case of #stochastic# PDEs because a large number of simulations are required to characterize the effects of uncertainties on the solution. These high costs reduce engineers' efficiency in solving inverse problems, building digital twins, or designing systems that must perform robustly in uncertain environments.To reduce computational costs, this proposal develops deep learning (DL) models that rapidly solve stochastic PDE systems. Our DL models have three novel features that distinguish them from existing approaches which solve PDEs via DL: (1) they are#transferable# which means they can readily model different processes that share the same governing equations, (2) they are #scalable# and hence can solve PDEs on large domains while resolving small-scale details, and (3) they are #probabilistic by construction# which means they can efficiently learn from scarce data and provide probabilistic predictions without using expensive sampling-based techniques. Compared to traditional solvers such as the finite element method, these features will provide the capability to predict the solution of stochastic PDEs with at least 2 orders of magnitude speedups and less than 2% loss in accuracy. By embedding our deep neural networks (DNNs) in multiscale or multi-physicssimulations, the computational savings will be even more.Upon successful completion, our contributions will enable on-the-fly emulation of a wide range of stochastic PDE systems on arbitrary domains via #pre-trained# DNNs. Hence, we expect to eliminate long training times while increasing accuracy and scalability. Additionally, we will leverage our approach to answer fundamental questions in engineering applications on multi-scale modeling of metallic alloys and thermofluidic heat control.To achieve real-time and robust performance, we design geometry-aware learning algorithms and leverage the well-established mathematics of domain decomposition methods that uniquely exploit parallel computing on heterogeneous machines that have multiple GPUs and CPUs. Additionally, to emulate multi-physics processes under uncertainty, we train multiple DNNs to learn each physics and then couple their predictions to solve the underlying stochastic PDE system. We expect our contributions to provide a sustainable platform for studying PDE-governed engineeredsystems. Therefore, we will develop the tools that ensure timely adoption and rapid maintenance. We will also provide scaling guidelines to estimate the required computational power for reaching desired levels of accuracy.less",

Th,is proposal formalizes the idea that it should be possible to make the whole larger than the sum of its parts in multi-agent robotic,s. For that to happen, it is no longer enough to consider capabilities in isolation, but rather how they interact to form brand new,capabilities. In ecology, such types of arrangements are known as a mutualistic interactions, or mutualisms, involving the exchange,of resources or services between two different species. Each species involved in a mutualism receives a benefit from the interaction,, and what this proposal envisions is a new framework for harnessing and encoding the idea of mutualism in a multi-agent robotics se,tting in order to go beyond the standard approach to heterogeneity by having brand new capabilities arise when combining agents with, different individual capabilities. To that end, this multidisciplinary proposal brings together a roboticist with an ecologist. The, two particular topics that will be pursed to achieve this ambitious and multidisciplinary agenda are: (1) Characterization of Mutua,listic Interactions in Ecology: To be able to leverage the types of mutualistic interactions observed in nature, the scope and scale, of such interactions need to be compiled and modeled in a unified and computationally actionable manner. This will constitute Resea,rch Area 1 and will, in particular, focus on developing models of mutualisms as co-evolutionary processes, a robotics-relevant taxon,omy of mutualisms, and an investigation of the conditions under which mutualisms break down and fail to be effective.(2) Leveraging,Mutualistic Interactions in Robotics: A theory will be developed for how to describe combined multi-robot capabilities in such a way, that brand new capabilities result from the deployment of heterogeneous agents. In particular, Research Area 2 will investigate how, to formally understand how mutualisms can be leveraged in the broad contexts of coverage control and task assignment problems for h,eterogeneous multi-robot teams.Approved for Public Releaseless",

        "abstract": "The recent discovery that local stresses near a dislocation can be used to stabilize nanoscale phases, which can be termed linear complexions, promises a new avenue for tailoring the mechanical response of structural solids. In this study, we will directly manipulate the defects responsible for plasticity while also enabling defect-aware design and nanoscale phase templating of future advanced engineering alloys. A unique aspect is the intimate coupling of solid mechanics and materials synthesis, naturally engaging two topical areas which are typically distinct. Stress is the primary driving force behind the segregation and structural changes involved in linear complexion transformations, and developing an understanding of these transitions will enable predictions about the outcomes of future processing experiments. On the other hand, real alloys containing different types and populations of linear complexions must be made in order to probe the fundamental mechanics of and barriers to dislocation mechanisms such as stacking fault constriction, dislocation breakaway, and secondary stress field interactions between the complexion and other defects. As a whole, this project will provide advancements in the fields of computational mechanics, in situ experimental mechanics utilizing novel electron microscopy techniques, defect engineering and design, and processing science. The assembled team offers a unique interdisciplinary approach that blends theory, computation, and experiment.less",

        "abstract": "Princeton Infrared Technologies, Inc. (PIRT) will team with University of California Irvine (UCI) to develop a room temperature imaging system with detectivity from 3 to 12 \u03bcm spanning mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and longwave infrared (LWIR) spectral ranges using non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) for standoff imaging spectroscopy and ranging.  This novel detection strategy captures MWIR/LWIR images at high pixel densities, high sensitivity, and low noise without cooling.  Currently, MWIR and LWIR imaging requires expensive low-bandgap semi-conducting materials, such as HgCdTe and InSb.  Cooled cameras that are commonly used to cover the entire 3 to 12 \u03bcm spectrum have low pixel densities such as 128x128, precluding the use of high-definition (HD) sampling for acquiring high quality videos in use for applications such as microscopy and hyperspectral imaging.  In this program, the team will deliver a 1280x1024 resolution camera using a custom InxAl1 x yGayAs array integrated with optics and high speed lasers that operate at room temperature to image light from 3 to 12 \u03bcm at video rates suitable for hyperspectral imaging of hot objects without the challenge of imaging through emissions.  The imaging system will also allow for depth measurements with a resolution of <20 \u00b5m.less",
