Tasking to acheive the stated objective of this proposal will include a suite of experimental tools applied to humans and non-human primate (NHP) subjects and computational approaches applied to the resulting multimodal datasets. Proposers hypothesize that integration across the decision-making, physical control of skilled action and adaptive control of stress neural systems can be observed as a function of training at the anatomic, neural, behavioral and computational levels of analysis. Proposers plan to combine commonly used neural and physiological sensing modalities (e.g., single unit and LFP electrophysiology, fMRI, heart rate, skin conductance, and pupillometry), and recently developed methods (fast scan cyclic voltammetry for dopamine neurotransmitter sensing and neurotropic viral methodologies) while subjects participate in a longitudinal approach-avoidance decision-making learning paradigm. The longitudinal behavioral study will be combined with neurochemical detection of the neurotransmitter dopamine, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cortical mapping of stress responses in decision-making neural networks in non-human primates and humans. This approach enables a systematic study of various neural contributors to the process of skill learning entailing theoretically well-grounded and hypothesis-driven experiments to assess the contribution of these various factors to learning. The proposed approach also includes a strong data analysis and modeling effort to help guide the design and interpretation of the experiments. The proposal also emphasizes the implementation of network control theory and less traditional methods from \"pure\" mathematics, such as algebraic topology, to identify neural networks controlling brain network dynamics and neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for skill learning.less",

        "abstract": "This proposal aims to demonstrate and comprehensively explore nonabelian anyons via an interdependent investigation of solid-state materials and ultracold atoms. Success would constitute a landmark basic-science achievement and mark a critical step towards new quantum technologies, as nonabelian anyons form the basis of fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Nonabelian excitations arise in two distinct contexts. First, they can appear \u00d4intrinsically\u00d5 as quasiparticles in strongly correlated topological phases of matter, notably fractional quantum Hall states and quantum spin liquids. Second, nonabelian statistics can appear \u00d4extrinsically\u00d5 from defects engineered in comparatively simple 2D abelian topological phases. In either case, a successful approach must feature widely tunable microscopic interactions, enabling global control over the phase diagram and local control over quasiparticles and defects. Recent advances pioneered by our team in the control of ultra-cold atoms and van der Waals heterostructures provide a timely opportunity to engineer both abelian and nonabelian anyons in conceptually novel and experimentally accessible configurations. Our proposed efforts utilize the shared virtues of cold atoms and van der Waals heterostructures\u00d1widely tunable interactions and physical geometries\u00d1while leveraging the special advantages of each platform, namely graphene\u00d5s unique electronic structure and the ability to tune microscopic cold-atom Hamiltonians with time-dependent potentials. We will develop three experimental avenues to nonabelian physics, focusing on the most promising cold-atom and solid-state candidates: realizing intrinsic nonabelian ground states, engineering synthetic nonabelian defects via Cooper pairing, and creating related defects by purely geometric means. Our general approach is to develop ground states proximal to nonabelian states, and then induce nonabelian behavior using tunable coupling between systems, introduction of defects, or periodic modulation. An important feature of the proposed work is the mutually complementary nature of our solidstate and cold-atom approaches. As an example, cold atoms straightforwardly realize disorder-free systems but often suffer from relatively high temperatures, while solid-state systems can be easily cooled but preclude total control over sample disorder. Even as we advance both fields through innovations in atomic cooling and fabrication of ultra-clean heterostructures, our joint effort will provide ample opportunity for reciprocal quantum emulation: atomic systems can simulate anyonic signatures in disordered solid-state systems using tunable disorder, while finite-temperature effects can be controllably simulated in solid-state systems. In many cases, our proposed platforms admit new probes that have never been applied to anyonic systems, including spatially resolved transport, thermodynamics, and spectroscopic measurements\u00d1facilitating an unprecedented characterization of nonabelian anyons not possible in either setting by itself.

While some metallic alloy systems are perceived as mature, new computational methodologies, emerging informatics tools and new high throughput experimental innovations are greatly expanding the scope for discovery and implementation of new alloys for future generations of advanced engineering components. Most recently, multi-principal element (MPE) alloys have emerged as a promising new class of advanced metallic materials. With five or more elements present in nondilute quantities, exceptional properties (strength, toughness, magnetization, fatigue endurance) have been observed, though mostly in small quantities of material that are far from optimized compositionally or structurally. A lack of fundamental understanding of the mechanistic origins of exceptional MPE properties, thought originally to be due to high configurational entropy, remains as a major barrier. Critical gaps in the computational and experimental infrastructure for exploration of the extraordinary large compositional design space also strongly inhibit progress.The overarching goal of this proposed effort is to revolutionize our ability todesign, explore and fundamentally understand the processing, properties andenvironmental behavior of refractory body centered cubic (bcc) MPE alloys.Compared to face centered cubic (fcc) MPE systems based on Ni, Fe and Co, farfewer investigations exist on refractory MPE alloys comprised of mixtures of higher temperature metallics, such as Ta, W, Nb, Mo, Hf. While refractory MPEs promise high strength, in combination with high melting temperature, the tendency for brittle fracture at low temperature, the difficult processing paths, and the breadth of the unexplored compositional space, make discovery of new compositions via a purely experimental approach completely prohibitive. To succeed in this endeavor, we have brought together an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team, called MPE.EDU. The proposed MPE.EDU team has a long track record of successful collaboration and deep expertise in metallic materials and integrated computational materials engineering from UCSB, UCSD and UVa, supported by collaborations with GE, ATI Specialty Alloys and Citrine Informatics. Together, MPE.EDU will launch new computational, high throughput experimental and informatics approaches, and integrate these tools to 1) explore the vast refractory MPE compositional space and 2) build the needed fundamental understanding of the properties of this new class of materials.The MPE.EDU team specifically aims to: (1) develop and deploy acomputational infrastructure complemented with combinatorial approaches forexploration of the MPE refractory alloy space; (2) simultaneously build open-source databases for refractory MPEs; (3) employ unique processing approaches for MPE synthesis; (4) integrate emerging computational and experimental approaches to understand the unique aspects of dislocation motion, diffusion and mechanical behavior in MPEs and; (5) address fundamental issues underpinning the strong influence of interstitial elements on mechanical behavior and their interplay with oxidation. With extensive experience in alloy design and integrated computational material science and engineering, MPE.EDU will remove empiricism from the design process and lay the foundation for rapid MPE alloy discovery and development.less",

The improvements will stem from a combination of increased device voltage swing and current swing at 30 GHz large signal conditions, as well as a method to increase the intrinsic linearity of the device. Those improvements will be based on improved epitaxy and new device processes and layout. Power cells with high absolute power will also be demonstrated. The metrics will be characterized by single-tone and two-tone load pull at the wafer level. These devices today seem to have good OIP3 to DC power ratio due to the device configuration. Further improvements to this linearity metric with simultaneous low noise figure will be achieved by a combination of reduction of the intrinsic nonlinearity, plus a novel incorporation of nonlinearity cancellation methods. These methods will be guided by experimental data and nonlinear device models, and realized by improvements to epitaxy in combination with appropriate device layout and processes. The device linearity will be characterized by two-tone load pull at the wafer level. Noise will be characterized by swept frequency noise parameters measured at the wafer level. The improvements to the device which are anticipated under this program will be beneficial for a wide range of transmitter and receiver applications.devices for ultra-high power and linearity at millimeter-waveless",

These properties depend on thenumber of valence electrons per formula unit allowing tuning of properties through compositionand alloying. Tuning of Heusler compound properties include semiconducting band gap,metallicity, magnetism, half-metallicity, superconductivity, shape memory, and, potentially,piezoelectricity. Combining Heusler compounds with different properties into heterostructuresand superlattices allows for fundamental studies as well as engineered applications ofmagnetoresistance and superconducting proximity effects coupled with shape memory andpiezoelectricity. Despite the wealth of tunable properties and potential for tailored dissimilarproperties heterostructures, studies of heterostructures and superlattices have not beenperformed.

Control of composition, structure and defects is essential to gain knowledge ofintrinsic properties and their tailoring.

        "abstract": "For the average high-schooler, education is synonymous with memorization and regurgitation of curriculum, whose concepts often have unclear links to real-world scenarios and that seldom, if ever, require an original contribution. SciTrekBiotech is about breaking this mold. SciTrekBiotech engages teams of K-12 students in structured but self-driven explorations of bio-science/technology questions, using multi-tiered mentoring involving peers, K-12 teachers, university students and faculty. Importantly, SciTrekBiotech \u2019s model of engagement allows the program to simultaneously impact distinct points of the STEM pipeline: from K-12 students, to teachers and teachers in training, to university students. This uncommon feature in the landscape of education programs, which typically have a single stakeholder, coupled with the PI\u2019s past record of success and the program access to world-class STEM and Biotechnology research programs, facilities and personnel, aligns SciTrekBiotech with multiple goals of the Federal and DoD STEM strategy and represents a unique addition to DoD\u2019s portfolio, with the potential to create a national model for K-12 education and teacher training. Briefly, in SciTrekBiotech, teams of 4-6 K-12 students investigate a scientific question prompted by an experimental observation presented to them by university students, trained in the SciTrekBiotech method. This is the start of a journey of discovery that sets the SciTrekBiotech experience apart from other K-12 programs: K-12 student teams are not passive spectators, but are given full ownership of the project. They formulate \u201ctestable questions,\u201d and decide on an experimental plan, which is then implemented over several days. Teams are also asked to present posters, discuss their findings, and provide an argument for their conclusions. Each class engages in two distinct \u201cmodules\u201d each year; assessments occur before and after the modules. For some modules, these investigations culminate in a classroom-wide optimization project involving competition between classes. The implementation of SciTrekBiotech\u2019s pedagogic model is made possible by extensive use of STEM undergraduate students (volunteers and core team). Volunteers are trained to lead authentic science inquiry: an uncommon experience in an educational path still mostly based on memorization. Core team members (Team SciTrekBiotech) carry out science education research, present their research at local and national science meetings, and help design modules and train volunteers. We propose a new course, open to all undergraduates, to foster appreciation of the scientific process, critical thinking skills, and students\u2019 attitudes towards science. A new seminar series, featuring industry and DoD speakers, will explore career paths in biotechnology. SciTrekBiotech has a built in sustainability plan through teachers\u2019 professional development: elementary and secondary teachers are empowered to independently lead their classrooms in the SciTrekBiotech modules, using workbooks and experimental materials provided by the program free of charge (secondary teachers are also supported by university students). In addition, SciTrekBiotech will develop a Master program (now a pilot) that will teach credential students (School of Education) how to incorporate this innovative program into their classroom. SciTrekBiotech leverages the successful track record of our outreach program SciTrek, which reaches 1,500-2,000 K-12 students each year (40-60% URMs): we propose to triple the number of K-12 student participants over the duration of the grant. In addition, we propose to expand the program beyond UCSB, through partnerships with other colleges and universities, towards creating a national model of K-12 education and teacher training.less",

        "abstract": "It has recently become clear that our current understanding of recombination processes at localized defects or impurities in solids,is incomplete. Such recombination events govern loss mechanisms and reliability of devices and the quantum efficiency of light emit,ters, including single-photon sources for quantum information science. Work by the PI has revealed that excited states play a decis,ive role in nonradiative recombination, and hitherto neglected ?impurity Auger? processes have a large impact. The proposed project,is aimed at rigorously calculating the rate of these processes; using the acquired knowledge to significantly improve device perform,ance; and validating the approach through experimental collaborations. Correct inclusion of these mechanisms is particularly import,ant in wide-bandgap materials, where current recombination models greatly underestimate the rates. Building on the PI?s expertise, f,irst-principles approaches for accurately calculating transition rates involving excited states and Auger processes will be develope,d. A fundamental understanding of these mechanisms is essential to suppress nonradiative recombination in wide-bandgap light emitte,rs and power electronics. The methodologies will also support the characterization and design of efficient centers for applications,in which radiative recombination underlies the functionality; these include phosphors, scintillators, and single-photon emitters for, quantum information science.Computational approaches will include density functional theory, hybrid functionals, the random phase a,pproximation, and many-body perturbation theory. Experimental validation will be enabled through funded and unfunded collaborations,. Nitride semiconductors will constitute the main materials platform used to construct and validate the approach, but applications a,re much broader. The ability to predict radiative and nonradiative rates will provide a framework for analyzing and controlling loss, mechanisms in devices and emission processes in single-photon emitters. The proposed basic research on a transformative science iss,ue will open new ways of thinking about recombination phenomena and lay a foundation for future new capabilities for DoD.As an educa,tional institution, UCSB performs fundamental and unclassified research.

Modulation of the high carrier density in these structures will lead to next-generation plasmonics by enabling reconfigurable antennas, and plasmonic modulators. The objective of the multidisciplinary program \u00d2EXtreme Electron concentration oxide DEvices (EXEDE)\u00d3 is to enable this paradigm shift in electronic and plasmonic devices by (i) the control of extreme-density, two-dimensional electron gases at polar oxide interfaces, (ii) engineering the band separation at oxide interfaces and (iii) innovative approaches to increase electron mobility and carrier velocities. To achieve these objectives, EXEDE establishes a highly interconnected multidisciplinary effort that includes sophisticated materials growth approaches, theoretical and experimental investigations of transport and optical physics and advanced device engineering. The devices and applications at the center of the project include extreme charge density field-effect transistors, charge gain devices, nanoribbon field effect transistors, plasmonic antennas and modulators. Transistor development will focus on high frequency electronic devices for communication applications and ultracompact high voltage energy efficient power switching devices. The device research program is underpinned by advancing oxide materials physics to address challenges such as their low mobility due to high phonon scattering rates. First-principles calculations and transport theory will improve understanding of transport, and will closely collaborate with experimental investigations of electron velocity and high-field transport, relevant for high-speed devices. Innovative approaches to enable efficient transport include phonon engineering and reduced dimensionality to enhance transport, band engineering to reduce effective mass, and hybrid oxide/Si structures to transfer the electrons to high mobility materials. A strong materials effort will be focused on unprecedented quality of extreme-electron concentration heterostructures, including on high mobility substrates, band offset engineering, and on exploring new oxide material systems with higher intrinsic mobility. Another significant outcome will be a knowledge base of device fabrication techniques for oxides, including contacts, etching, surface passivation, and gate dielectrics, and a clear understanding of the critical device physics. The program will significantly impact DoD capabilities not only through the demonstration of superior and new electronic and plasmonics devices that could enhance communication, signal processing, and energy conversion applications, based on a new class of electronic materials, but also by catalyzing further research in this field.less",

        "abstract": "Project Abstract Cyber-physical systems (CPS), or systems that interact with the physical world through sensory input and cyber-control systems, are becoming increasing ubiquitous. Such systems are often deployed in safety-critical scenarios, e.g., managing power generation and delivery, controlling manufacturing processes, or coordinating automotive systems. As opposed to traditional cyber-systems, physical faults can easily lead to human harm, sometimes on a large scale. Therefore, the reliability, integrity, and availability of physical processes and their control are of paramount concern. We propose to defend cyber-physical systems through two complementary research thrusts: Inferring physical models for cyber-physical systems and federated learning. The goal of the model inference thrust is to identify behavioral models of cyber-physical systems that characterize the system's physical aspects. However, instead of deriving the physical model from engineering blueprints or expert knowledge, we propose to treat the physical process as a black box. We then learn models from observations of the CPS that are augmented with physical constraints that apply for the process under analysis (e.g., maximum values for velocity, acceleration, or other physical dimensions). Messages can then be identified as malicious if they would drive the inferred model into a state that violates the underlying physical constraints. Learning physical models will provide operators with real-time feedback of anomalous and potentially malicious control commands and sensory inputs to cyber-physical systems. However, machine learning in adversarial contexts -- that is, one in which attackers can supply inputs to the protected system that are evaluated by the model, and where an attacker might have knowledge of the model parameters -- has important limitations such as scarcity of training data and concept drift. We propose to address these concerns using federated learning. The intuition behind federated learning is that global information can compensate for local deficiencies. In particular, federated learning involves the use of inputs, behaviors, and models gathered from outside the local system. We propose several instantiations of this idea to provide (i) distributed identification of \"black sheep,\" or systems that behave differently from a community of similar systems (a \"flock\"); flock behavior as a mechanism for suppressing local false positives; and, compensation for local training data scarcity. Protecting existing and next-generation cyber-physical systems will require significant research that is informed by real-world issues such as limited resources and real-time constraints. Our proposed approach integrates high-fidelity physical models for local cyber-physical systems with federated learning that exploits global information for improved detection capability and minimal false positives. This novel approach will fill a crucial gap in our ability to defend the cyber-physical systems that power our infrastructure and our society.less",

        "abstract": "Software has become complex, layered, and interconnected. Software systems control almost every aspect of ourcritical infrastructur\"\"e from the power grid, to air traffic, to financial networks.Software engineers are relying increasingly on third-party libraries a\"nd software frameworks to implement complexfunctionality and perform code re-use. Even though the use of frameworks and reusable co\"mponents helps inmanaging the complexity of modern software systems, this trend has had a negative impact on both security andperf\"\"ormance. Like any other pieces of code, libraries and frameworks contain bugs, and some of these bugs can beexploited, introducing\" vulnerabilities in applications using these components.Since third-party libraries and frameworks are made to be used by a wide va\"riety of applications, the common case isthat an application does not use all of the functionality provided by these components. Th\"\"at is, there exists functionalityin the third-party library or framework that is \"\"dead code\"\" because of how the component is used b\"\"y the application.This dead code increases the security exposure of an application.On the performance side of the equation, excess\"\"ive use of third-party frameworks and libraries causes \"\"API bloat\"\",draining performance as control flow makes its way through layer\"s of API abstraction before triggering actualfunctionality.The bloat problem does not only affect programs and applications in iso\"lation. Clients and servers are usuallydeveloped to interact with a very diverse set of counterparts, since all the possible intera\"ctions are unknown.It is clear that the problem of code bloat and security exposure can be attacked along two axes: one axis is the\" \"\"type\"\"of the transformation, while the other axis is the \"\"scope\"\" of the transformation. More precisely, a type of transformationc\"\"an \"\"trim\"\" code, or can \"\"reshape\"\" the code being executed while preserving the desired functionality. On the other axis,an approach\"\" can operate on a single program (including the associated libraries and frameworks), or a group ofprograms. In the latter case, th\"\"e approach is deployment-specific, as it takes into account which programs will interactand how they will interact.To address the\"\" problem of code bloating, we propose to develop novel binary trimming and binary shaping statictechniques that can operate on sing\"le programs or groups of programs to reduce their security exposure and improvetheir performance.The research is focus on four mai\"n thrusts, defined by the composition of types and scopes of the possibletransformations.1. Bintrimmer: Static binary trimming for\"\" programs.As a first thrust of the research, we will alleviate the code bloat that leads to an increased attack surface. We propose\"to design an approach that uses static analysis to identify and remove unused regions of code.2. Binshaper: Static binary shaping for programs.The second thrust of the project focuses on an approach that automatically identifies and minimizes both bloated APIcall-chains and redundant or insufficiently optimized series of instructions.3. Binstemmer: Binary trimming for program groups.The\" third thrust of the proposed research focuses on analyzing, in an integrated fashion, interacting programs. Theapproach will lever\"\"age static analysis techniques to infer how the programs interact using specific protocols, andremove protocol-handling code that i\"s unused.4. Binplexer: Binary shaping for program groups.The fourth thrust of the research focuses on reshaping the code of interacting programs so that server~sprotocolhandling code can be reshaped in a client-aware fashion.The outcome of this research will b\"e tools and techniques that will improve the security of binaries without requiringaccess to source code, and, by relying on static\"\" analysis techniques, will guarantee that the functionality of the codewill be preserved.less",

This will be achieved through the development of ultra-low loss tunnel barriers and dielectrics, and a wafer bonding solution will be explored for scalability and material investigation. The project is divided into three plans: fabrication and testing of different junctions, realization of merged-element transmon qubits, and investigation of multi-qubit systems.",

        "abstract": "This project will extend connections between quantum information and gravitational holography by elucidating the conditions under which quantum error correcting codes define holographic systems, and by incorporating further elements of gravitational holography into simple quantum information models. Chief among these is a symmetry called diffeomorphism invariance, which is a key feature of gravitational dynamics and is required for gravitational holography. We will also add dynamics to existing quantum codes to model time dependent bulk physics of the sort found in the interiors of black holes. Finally, we will use the fact that the boundary theory is often a local quantum field theory and associated tools from the so called Tomita Takesaki theory to further expand the bulk-boundary dictionary.less",

The switch would block to 1200V, have a threshold voltage greater than 5 V, and the phase 2 switch will target an on resistance less than 15 ohm-mm and current more than 1 Amp. To accomplish these targets, Transphorm will combine the design requirements of realizing a high (and positive) threshold voltage while maintaining a low total on resistance while maintain a low switching resistance. The device will target low dc to rf dispersion or achieve a dynamic on resistance which is within 2x of the static performance. The switch would ultimately be capable of switching at high frequencies (1 MHz or higher) with efficiency in excess of 97%.less",
