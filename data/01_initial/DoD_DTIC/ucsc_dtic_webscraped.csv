0,Trust Worthy Information Storage Technology Enhanced Devices (TWISTED),Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Peter Alvaro,"Continuing advances in solid state storage technology have enabled detachable storage devices that are inexpensive, high bandwidth and high capacity, making them practical for sharing even large amounts of data among devices that need not be networked.  For this reason, they are very attractive as a mechanism for secure data storage as well as transfer. Unfortunately the current generation of memory sticks expose risks that make them unsuitable for use by US government agencies. The primary concern with these devices is the attack surface presented by the micro-controller that is required to present the storage as a USB peripheral to the host operating system. Exploits have been demonstrated in which an attacker could, with brief physical access to a memory stick, reprogram its firmware so as to enable arbitrary privilege escalation on a host operating system without needing to exploit an OS-level software vulnerability.  A reprogrammed storage device could exploit the USB protocol, which multiplexes many physical devices on logical channels and permits devices to negotiate registration (and re-registration), to masquerade as a keyboard for long enough to capture the root password via physical keystrokes.  The flash can be reprogrammed with a laptop, making tamper-resistant designs ineffective. We describe the first year of work designing and implementing a secure operating system for memory sticks that is correct-by-construction as well as amenable to formal verification.  Several key features of Twizzler make it ideally suited to the task. It structures memory---whether persistent or volatile---into coarse grained objects that are the units of access control, reducing both the number and variety of access policies that must be considered when deploying the OS. Comprising only 5K lines of code and exposing only 20 system calls to user-space, Twizzler exposes a minimal attack surface and is small enough to be a reasonable target for embedded architecture as well as for systematic verification. Moving the kernel out of the I/O path, it exposes the raw I/O latency and bandwidth  of the memory to programs. To transform Twizzler into an appropriate target for detachable storage micro-controllers requires a research and development effort along three distinct but interrelated lines: Guaranteeing via a flat permission model with no superuser role, in which cryptographically signed capabilities persistently encode access rights. Providing isolation of untrusted code both within and across threads of control via \emph{security contexts} that subsume UNIX roles, and  gated APIs that subsume system calls and IPC, providing fine-grained control of privileges without escape hatches. Ensure secure boot and integrity of trusted components via unforgeable, content-derived naming.less","1,494,236",2021,2025
0,A Productive Open Source Hardware Development Flow,National Security Agency,to Jose Renau,"This proposal ask for resources to improve the productivity of hardware designers. The resulting infrastructure aims at becoming the core of hardware designers tools by allowing large scale designs, incremental elaboration/synthesis/simulation, leverage multicores, and cloud. We call this project LGraph for the Live Graph that resides at its core. LGraph is designed to become the next LLVM-like infrastructure for hardware design with a focus on fast response time for large designs. Current tools, commercial and academic, do not scale well with large designs. This lack of scalability is shown in compilation, simulation, and verification. As the designs scale in size, the tools get very long compilation times, long synthesis feedback loops, and even slower simulations. While software flows are used to fast incremental flows, hardware designers need to wait hours to get feedback. The goal of this project is that for synthesis and simulation a small code change even for a large project should complete in a few seconds. In addition, other time consuming tasks like formal verification or design frequency improvement should also finish in few seconds. The proposal includes details by providing incremetal elaboration, scalable synthesis, incremental simulation with Hot Reload, scalable simulation. All these changes while providing more correct by construction transformations with elastic pipelines and third party tools. If funded, the team will be directed by PI Renau and co-PI Beamer at UC Santa Cruz.less","1,151,439",2019,2022
0,Physiological Resilience in Mammalian Divers: Assessing the role of vascular conflict and control in recovery from anthropogenic disturbances,United States Department of the Navy,to Terrie Williams,"Underwater noise, most notably from shipping, seismic activities and naval sonars, has emerged as one of the most important and controversial stressors on marine mammal populations worldwide. Despite geo-spatial and temporal evidence linking such anthropogenic disturbances to mass stranding events by deep-diving cetaceans, causal mechanisms between oceanic noise and lethal or sublethal injuries have been difficult to identify. Currently, the leading hypotheses suggest a combination of extreme behavioral flight responses, cardiovascular instability and decompression syndromes. However, the question remains, what factors differentiate when an escape response by cetaceans due to noise exposure leads to benign avoidance or to death? An understanding of two critical elements of the escape response, physiological resiliency and recovery, are required to answer this question. To date, neither has been studied for any integration of key behavioral (dive duration, exercise level), environmental (water temperature), physiological (heart rate, metabolic demand, respiratory rate, heat flow), and biochemical (pH, lactate, blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, catecholamines/cortisol) triggers that control the three Rs of escape reactions in mammalian divers - response, resilience and recovery. We will focus on four physiological pathways to assess resiliency and recovery via the cardiovascular system, 1) thermal and metabolic homeostasis, 2) metabolite control, 3) neurological protection, and 4) behavioral-respiratory integration. This will be accomplished by pairing our current physiological and blood chemistry monitors with newly available, portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitors, heat flux tags and doppler ultrasound technology for assessing tissue blood flow. Using this multi-variable approach with trained cetaceans (bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales) performing controlled swims and dives, we will determine the hierarchy of blood flow to central and peripheral body sites to support local oxygenation and thermoregulation during submersion and surface recovery. Independent and sequential dives will be compared. Particular focus will be on central and peripheral thermal windows, and the hypoxia-sensitive vascular master switch, the brain. By correlating vascular events and blood chemistries with common physiological and behavioral markers used for recovery (i.e., breathing frequency, heart rate, stroke frequency, dive duration) in trained cetaceans under controlled conditions we will develop predictive metrics for determining the timeline for re-establishment of thermal, cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis in wild diving mammals. This will be tested on both new and previously archived data for the elite deep diver, the narwhal, during control and noise-exposed periods in the wild. This project will be the most comprehensive analysis of diving physiology for cetaceans exposed to unanticipated noise to date. For the first time the cardiac, respiratory, and energetic responses of noise-impacted wild, deep-diving cetaceans will be followed throughout escape and recovery. As such, the study will provide a comparative foundation and key physiological metrics applicable to evaluating the effect of fear and submerged exercise on other marine mammal species and even human divers. Ultimately, these metrics will enable Navy personnel to, 1) develop environmentally-sensitive schedules for acoustic activities that account for the most likely lethal and sub-lethal effects on marine mammal populations, and 2) instigate measures that will promote rapid recovery and resumption of normal behaviors by affected animals.less","959,680",2020,2023
0,Physiological Consequences of Flight Responses in Diving Mammals: Critical metrics for assessing the impacts of novel environmental stimuli on cetaceans and other marine living species,United States Department of the Navy,to Terrie Williams,"During the past two decades, oceanic noise including Navy sonar has remained one of the most controversial and debated stressors aff""""ecting marine mammal populations. Although it has been linked to numerous mass stranding events involving deep-diving cetaceans, ide""ntifying the actual cause of injury has been difficult. This is due to the fact that scientists are just beginning to understand how"" marine mammals respond to anthropogenic disturbances. Specifically, we do not know how the suite of conflicting biological response""s associated with escaping noise interacts in marine mammals to result in tissue injury or death. Only after determining the physiol""ogical consequences of, 1) diving deep and fast, 2) performing escape maneuvers, and 3) surviving disrupted metabolic control during"" submerged flight will we be able to make the link between abnormal behaviors by marine mammals and harm by aversive oceanic noise."" To address this, the main purpose of the pr""""oposed study is to determine the physiological consequences of escape responses in cetaceans, and to develop the key metrics for acc""urately predicting short- and long-term energetic impacts of anthropogenic noise on diving mammals. Our approach considers that anth""ropogenic disturbances that harm marine mammals are associated with extreme, conflicting physiological responses (high speed and ele""vated stroke frequencies coupled to bradycardia and metabolic suppression) that occur with submerged escape. We focus on cetaceans d""ue to the sensitivity of this group to oceanic noise, their vulnerability to developing decompression syndromes, the lack of biologi""""cal information regarding anthropogenic threats, and concern over the number of cetacean strandings attributed to Navy sonar. Usign"" a lab-to-field protocol with trained and wild odontocete cetaceans ranging in body mass from 50 kg porpoises to 3500 kg killer whal""es, we will test the central hypothesis, that the unique biological adaptations that normally enable cetaceans to safely complete a"" dive are overridden during escape responses and pose a risk to metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis. Four specific aims are pro""posed, 1) determine energetic costs and physiological risks of evasive manuevers by dolphins and whales, 2) build allometric regress""""ions for predicting gait-specific stroking costs for small and large cetaceans, 3) assess the physiological effects of metabolic dia""""pause in diving cetaceans particularly for maintaining heart-brain integration, and 4) apply energetic/physiological metrics to pred""ict the cost of escape in free-ranging cetaceans exposed to anthropogenic noise. Custom heart rate-accelerometer instruments and blood flow monitors combined with open-flow respirometry will be used to determine the capacity for submerged escape by cetacea""ns. We will develop a suite of metrics (peformance costs, evidence of cardiovascular anomalies, relative risk to neural function, at""ypical behaviors) to define acute and chronic impacts due to oceanic noise. By combining data for small and large cetaceans from thi""s proposal and our previous work, we will complete an allometric analysis that will allow investigators to translate behavioral and"""" accelerometer data collected previously or in the future into energetic impacts for animals responding to noise. Thus, results from"""" this project will be directly applicable to all cetaceans, will represent the most comprehensive energetic analysis for free-rangin""""g cetaceans, will represent the most comprehensive energetic analysis for free-ranging cetaceans to date, and will provide critical"""" data for population threat models. Importantly, the project will accomplish the overall objective of improving the protection of ma""rine mammals during Naval operations by enabling Navy personless","910,997",2017,2020
0,Learning Algorithms for Hybrid Dynamical Systems using Experimental Data,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Ricardo Sanfelice,"The objective of this work is to generate new fundamental science for hybrid dynamical systems that enables systematic design of algorithms for learning the parameters, dynamics, and constraints of such complex systems, using experimental data. Hybrid systems are dynamical systems with intertwined continuous and discrete behavior. Hybrid controllers are algorithms that involve logic variables, timers, memory states, along with the associated decision-making logic. The combination of such mixed behavior, both in the system to control and in the algorithms, is embodied in key future engineering systems. The future autonomous systems will have variables that change continuously according to physics laws, exhibit jumps due to controlled switches, replanning of maneuvers, on-the- y redesign, and failures, while the control algorithms require logic to adapt to such abrupt changes. Hybrid behavior also emerges in such engineering systems due to their complexity. In fact, communication events, abrupt changes in connectivity, and the cyber-physical interaction between vehicles, humans, robots, their environment, and communication networks lead to impulsive behavior that interacts with physics and computing. The intellectual impact of the proposed research plan stems from a novel use of hybrid control theory, one that leads to experimental data-driven learning algorithms for hybrid systems that are not only robust but also optimal. The proposed combination of hybrid control and optimization informed by real-time data exploits { in a holistic manner { key robust stabilization capabilities of hybrid feedback control and optimality guarantees of receding horizon control for complex autonomous systems of interest to AFOSR that are part of the broad mission of the DoD.less","795,503",2023,2027
0,Identification of Navy-relevant oceanographic hotspots guided by ethical practices and experiential learning,United States Department of the Navy,to Roxanne Beltran,"The United States Navy#s position as one of the largest global maritime fleets and concurrent investment in the development and testing of sophisticated sonar technologies means negative interactions with marine wildlife are likely to occur. Identifying where marine organisms are most concentrated can reduce the frequency of negative Navy-wildlife interactions. Biological hotspots (areas of intense biological activity that promote feeding activity in higher trophic level species) have become an important monitoring tool for describing locations where certain species and environments are at greater risk. However, the research community lacks detailed information about the location of biological hotspots in the marine environment. Large marine vertebrates such as whales, seals, seabirds and sea turtles have been identified as ecosystem sentinels, or indicators of overall ecosystem processes and climate change impacts. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are an ideal vesselfor detecting hotspots of biological activity in the ocean because they are fast, quiet, far-ranging, and deep diving. Our research group co-leads a long-term elephant seal monitoring program which contains the tools to review what is known about hotspots and to understand how hotspots vary across scales using drones, stable isotope analysis, and instruments attached to animals. The research program can facilitate valuable quantitative skills development for undergraduate students, highlight career opportunities in the DoD workforce, and train graduate students to facilitate a safe field environment for future scientists. The proposed work cannot take place without considering the ethics of animal handling and compensating young field researchers. Thus, we propose a holistic research program for conducting Navy-relevant research on biological hotspots grounded in ethical considerations and experiential learning. The characterization and subsequent avoidance of knownbiological hotspots pertaining to foraging, reproduction, migration, and multi-species aggregations of marine animals would be advantageous when planning Naval exercises. Avoiding these areas would not only reduce the direct impacts on the organisms, but also potential negative rippling effects to coastal communities dependent on ocean ecosystem services such as ecotourism and fisheries.Approved for public releaseless","750,000",2023,2026
0,Surgical Cockpit -- Multisensory/Multimodal Interfaces for Robotic Surgery,United States Department of the Army,to Jacob Rosen,"The ongoing military conflicts demonstrate the need to deploy skilled personnel equipped with advanced technology to provide medical and surgical attention as close as possible to the point of injury. A major problem is the occasional mismatch between the type of injury and the type of surgeon available to treat it. Telerobotic surgery is a means to mediate the narrow spectrum of available front line surgical expertise. To date, most R & D efforts on medical robotics for the battlefield have focused on the remote site (the manipulator) with little focus on the critical man-machine interface which is the surgical console. The objective of the proposed project is to develop, fabricate, integrate, and experimentally demonstrate the functionality of a multimodal surgical cockpit (surgical console) enabling telesurgery capabilities which expand the range of surgical expertise to the level dictated by the type and nature of wounds in the battlefield. Through the proposed cockpit, the one or multiple expert surgeons located in the continental US will be able to collaborate while interface with different manufacturers""end effector robots through a universal interface and perform a surgical procedures on solider located anywhere around the globe with a reduced workload and enhanced situational awareness. While the proposed surgical cockpit will be designed specifically for controlling surgical manipulators, it can also provide a unique and innovative console design elements which could be beneficial to all warriors using remote systems, such as UAV, UGV, etc.less","749,942",2010,2011

0,Secure and Resilient Design of Internet of Battlefield Things,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Hamid Sadjadpour,"This proposal focuses on designing secure Internet of Military/Battlefield Things that consists of sensors, wearable devices, mobile systems, IoT devices, drones and robots. The proposal aims at finding holistic security solutions for these systems using a multi-disciplinary approach. We will develop unique results such as information theoretic encryption techniques, provable secure control algorithms, novel key exchange and authentication protocols, and attackresilient multi-agent systems that can be useful for many types of military applications including the Internet of Military/Battlefield Things. The main goal of this proposal is to protect the confidentiality, security, and recovery of the information in a disruptive environment. To address these challenges, we will develop an interdisciplinary approach that will bring together three different fields: (1) Control theory for hybrid and cyber-physical systems, (2) Information Theory, and (3) Cybersecurity. The combination of these three fields will allow us to model the dynamics and algorithms used by these cyber-physical systems, secure their communications, and detect potential attacks. Our goal is to develop algorithms and protocols that enhance the security of Internet of Military/Battlefield Things against state sponsored hostile actors to the highest possible degree. Our proposal includes participation of graduate and undergraduate students in this program using UCSC internal funds. For graduate students, we intend to recruit minority and underrepresented graduate students using UC sponsor Cota-Robles scholarship.

0,Iontronic Control of Vmem and Bioelectric Communication in Bacteria,United States Department of the Army,to Marco Rolandi,"Bioelectronics interface electronic devices with biology with the potential for sensing and actuation. Ranging from intercellular communication to organ function, ionic species play an important role in natural systems. A majority of physiological processes, such as muscle contraction, neuronal signaling and metabolism, involve the exchange of ions between cells. Specific to bacteria, ions play a large role in homeostasis and contribute to the communication among bacteria in a colony. Here, we will develop electrophoretic bioelectronic pumps integrated in a microfluidic chip that accommodates cultures of B. subtilis. These pumps will be able to deliver ions and nutrients to B. subtilis to study their communication as a function of nutrient continent. Specifically, we will monitor B. subtilis membrane voltage in the presence of ionic or chemical actuation and explore whether we can control the oscillation in time and space of membrane voltage that have been observed in microfluidic cultures with nutrient shortage. The goal here is to establish two-way communication with bacteria and affect their electronic processes such as membrane voltage without the need for cell penetration.

0,Algorithms and Distribution-Free Models for Social and Information Networks,United States Department of the Army,to Seshadhri Comandur,"Theoretical computer science has, over the past 40 years, developed a remarkably sophisticated toolbox for reasoning about and designing algorithms for well-motivated classes of graphs, such as planar graphs, bounded-treewidth graphs, and perfect graphs. Meanwhile, the past 10--15 years have seen the rise of large-scale social networks, such as the graphs defined by Facebook friendship relationships or followers on Twitter. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to define new graph classes relevant to the study of social networks, and to develop structural and algorithmic results for such graphs. More concretely, the project comprises three closely interrelated goals: definitions, structural results, and algorithms. 1. The first research goal is to develop definitions of graph classes motivated by triadic closure --- the idea that vertices with common neighbors are likely to be connected by an edge. There is tremendous empirical support for this property in social networks, and this property seems to lead to graph classes with more exploitable structure than the other most widely accepted properties of social networks, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions. 2. The second research goal is to develop structural results for the graph classes we define, to understand what these graphs ``look like.'' This is a familiar strategy for understanding restricted graph classes, analogous to using separator theorems to make precise how planar graphs resemble grids, tree decompositions to quantify how bounded-treewidth graphs resemble trees, and the regularity lemma to describe how dense graphs are approximately composed of ``random-like'' bipartite graphs. Such structural results are interesting in their own right and provide a flexible foundation for algorithmic applications. 3. The third research goal is to develop algorithms that solve problems more effectively for graphs in the proposed classes than for worst-case graphs. Empirically, many optimization problems that are notoriously difficult in the worst case, such as finding cliques or dense subgraphs, are solved to near-optimality in social networks by fast heuristics. Narrowing the gap between this theoretical intractability (in the worst case) and empirical tractability (in social networks) of these problems is a concrete and practically relevant challenge for algorithm analysis ``beyond the worst case.'' Specific opportunities include provably polynomial-time or fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for problems that are NP-hard in worst-case graphs; approximation algorithms with better approximation ratios for social networks than in the worst case; and algorithms for the approximate recovery of planted solutions.less","613,498",2019,2022
0,Developing Metrics of Animal Condition and their linkage to Vital Rates: Further Development of the PCoD Model,United States Department of the Navy,to Daniel Costa,"A framework has been created to understand the population consequences of disturbance. However, there are a number of elements that are necessary for the implementation of this framework. This project would use elephant seals as a model system to quantify the following transfer functions that link: (1) changes in behavior and allostatic load to life functions, and (2) changes in vital rates to population effects. We propose using our existing dataset, along with new data form our ongoing elephant seal field work to explore the specific physiological mechanisms that link body condition and reproduction to better understand how energy status integrates with allostatic load to modulate reproductive effort. We will develop and refine the following metrics associated with physiological measures of body condition that allow detection of pregnancy or the timing of reproductive suppression and provide insights into the physiological mechanisms that link body condition to gonadal function. We will examine the following issues: we will use standard hormonal assays to detect implantation, pregnancy, and mediators of gonadal function that link body condition and foraging success to reproduction in northern elephant seals; we will examine whether there are unique signatures within the diving behaviors of pregnant vs. non-pregnant female elephant seals, using our condition indices determine the thresholds that are associated with implantation and termination of pregnancy; and lastly determine the maximum and minimum condition thresholds for survival in both adults and pups.less","612,850",2018,2021
0,High Spatial and Angular Resolution X-Ray Diffractometer for Quantum Material Thin Films and Multilayers,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to David Lederman,"Quantum materials composed of antiferromagnetic thin films, heterostructures, and multilayers composed of two-dimensional materials are of much current interest because of their possible applications in low power spintronics, THz electronics, and quantum computing. When such materials are synthesized, it is crucial to thoroughly characterize them so that of intrinsic properties (e.g., the electronic and topological properties of the material) or extrinsic properties (i.e., defects). Moreover, if the structural characteristics at the nanoscale can be systematically studied and correlated with the synthesis methodology, the methodology can be altered to optimize the quality of the material. The proposed instrument will consist of a high power, rotating anode x-ray diffractometer optimized to determine the structure of the thin films, heterostructures, and multilayers. In particular, the system will have excellent angular and lateral spatial resolution with high x-ray intensity, characteristics which are crucial for the characterization of ultra-thin films (films thinner than approximately 2 nm). For antiferromagnetic thin films which could be used in THz spintronics, the crystalline quality, interface roughness, and strain can significantly affect their magnonic properties. The system will allow rapid characterization of the structure of the films, both in- and out-of-plane, to identify the structural factors which optimize the filmsÕ spintronic properties. For two-dimensional materials, where samples consist of flakes which are on the order of 100 µm in lateral size, the focused beam (approximately 50 µm in diameter) capabilities of the system will allow the measurement of single flakes, allowing the determination of their structure (for example, the type of stacking in multilayered samples). The combination of high intensity and high lateral resolution will approach the capabilities of synchrotron-based measurements, making high quality routine characterization of our samples in our lab, thus increasing sample quality and reproducibility. Researchers other than the PI and Co-PI at UC Santa Cruz who synthesize thin films and are interested in neuromorphic computing and optical sensors will also benefit from this new instrumentation. From an educational point of view, the instrument will help train a new diverse generation of scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering. UC Santa Cruz students at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be trained to use the instrument through collaborations of their advisors with the PI and Co-PI. Undergraduate students from community colleges in California will use the instrument as part of an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program led by the PI. High school students participating in the summer Science Internship Program (SIP) at UC Santa Cruz, will use the instrumentation as part of their research activities.

0,Acquisition of a Glove Box System for Fabrication and Characterization of Quantum Materials Devices,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Jairo Velasco,"Many two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and topological insulators (TIs) are promising for the development of electronic components with new capabilities for defense-related applications, such as sensing and information processing. These 2D material nanoscale devices are highly tunable platforms that enable unprecedented manipulation of emergent quantum properties, such as quantum confinement, superconductivity, and dissipation-less metallic edge states. By implementing these materials into nanoscale devices, their unusual correlated quantum properties can be exploited for novel technological applications. Unfortunately, the intriguing quantum properties of these materials are affected or even destroyed by exposure to air and water. Environmental control is thus crucial for studying the fundamental properties of novel electronic components based on air-sensitive 2D materials. In order to address problems with air contamination that preclude many fundamental studies of the properties of air-sensitive 2D materials, this proposal requests support for the acquisition and setup of a glove box system for fabrication and characterization of 2D quantum material devices at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), a minority serving institution with over 30% Hispanic enrollment. The proposed glovebox is equipped with tools for 2D material device fabrication, such as an optical microscope, a spin coater and a thermal evaporator. It is also equipped with characterization tools well suited for 2D material devices, such as a state-of-the-art atomic force microscope (AFM) and a four-point probe station. The proposed equipment is a unique and versatile system, with only a few comparable systems available worldwide. Hence, the proposed system will enable unprecedented landmark studies on pristine, air sensitive 2D material devices. The proposed glove box system will enhance the research facilities and increase the impact of current and future research on materials at UCSC. It will also enhance undergraduate and graduate student education/training with regards to materials. As a result, the quality of UCSC STEM programs in general and the education and training capabilities of the emerging Materials Science and Engineering Initiative (MSEI) at UCSC will be enhanced significantly. These positive impacts are possible because equipment such as the proposed glove box system and its integration with existing UCSC facilities are unmatched in labs around the world, and therefore, will enable transformative research in the area of 2D materials electronics. Importantly, these studies will be driven by the efforts of graduate and undergraduate students, and thus the proposed glove box system will directly contribute to the scientific training of these students who will perform cutting edge scientific research. Moreover, summer interns from high-achieving community colleges that are Hispanic Serving Institutions will participate in these research projects during their summer research internships. Additional efforts will be made to include local high school students and/or teachers into research projects that utilize the proposed glove box system as well.less","574,544",2017,2018

0,Mitigate Uncertainty in Space Control Systems Through Computational Optimal Control,United States Air Force,to Qi Gong,"How to mitigate uncertainty in optimal control framework is a problem of great practical importance, especially in space control area. On one hand, stringent performance and complex nonlinearities of space systems demand the use of optimal control. On the other, uncertainty in any control systems is ubiquitous. It degrades performance of optimal control, and can potentially cause failure in control systems. Recently, a new framework, Riemann-Stieltjes (RS) optimal control, has been proposed to explicitly address uncertain in optimal control setting. In the proposed research, we will explore RS optimal control framework to mitigate the uncertainty in space control systems. We will conduct research on the following topics: 1) analyzing modeling issues in Riemann-Stieltjes optimal control, especially on handling different objectives in constrained problems; 2) developing computational algorithms to improve the efficiency for problems with higher dimensional uncertainty, and conducting research to analyze the performance of the developed algorithms; 3) investigating feedback implementation for optimal control of uncertain systems; 4) testing the results on space control applications. The proposed research will improve control performance of spacecraft, and enrich scientific missions of satellites; thus benefits general public. Moreover, the outcome of the proposed work is portable to other control systems. The algorithms developed in this project provide engineers with new ways to solve uncertain optimal control problems in challenging engineering applications, for example, motion planning of autonomous vehicles, an area with many industry applications and interests.

0,VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS WITH HYBRID DYNAMICS UNDER UNCERTAINTY,United States Air Force,to Ricardo Sanfelice,"In conventional design processes, the design of the plant, the controller, the prototype as well as the certification of validity are products of consecutive phases of development utilizing distinct simulation, fabrication, and synthesis tools. Each phase produces an “optimal” solution, which is typically not jointly optimal for all phases. Phases need to be restarted from scratch if a new edge case or catastrophic failure is discovered at a later stage, and the interaction between failures, fabrication tolerances, and model inaccuracy is murky at best. Instead, we propose to combine rapid prototyping, hybrid systems techniques for modeling and control, formal verification, and quantified uncertainty and risk models for systematic autonomous system development. New advanced systems have raced ahead of our ability to analyze them, while advanced manufacturing technologies allow us to quickly and inexpensively build them. The Physical Design Optimization (PDO) paradigm we propose rapidly prototypes the design, validates its fabrication, and quantifies both its performance and its failure risk by conducting physical tests of the prototypes. This allows the PDO process to rationally improve this combined representation without being subject to reality-gaps in simulation, and without requiring catastrophic restarts when new edge cases and failure modes are discovered.less","540,000",2020,

0,Targeted management approaches for minimizing Navy activity impacts on long-lived vertebrates,United States Department of the Navy,to Roxanne Beltran,"Significant progress has been made linking behavior with health and vital rates to predict thepotential for a Population Consequence, of Disturbance (PCoD). PCoD models rely on inputparameters such as survival and reproductive rates that have generally been thought, toadequately represent the population. However, these demographic measures are typically derivedfrom population averages, thus assu,ming that the likelihood of reproduction is equivalent acrossindividuals. Recent research in long-lived vertebrates has discovered t,hat the likelihoods ofreproduction and survival are highly variable across individuals. Therefore, the populationconsequence of a di,sturbance is not likely to impact individuals across all demographic groupsequally. Some females might be particularly resilient to,disturbance whereas others might bemore sensitive. Data on northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and bottlenosedolphins,(Tursiops truncatus) has shown that a few individuals appear to be more resilient tointerannual variations in resource limitation or, other stressors and thus disproportionatelycontribute to population viability; however, traits that contribute to this resilience a,re not known.We propose that targeted management should account for this individual heterogeneity because adisturbance can have a tr,emendously variable impact on population dynamics depending on thecharacteristics of the disturbed animals. To quantify the importan,ce of individual variability forPCoD efforts, we will utilize northern elephant seals. In this robust model system, critical data on,the phenological, ecological, physiological, and genetic drivers of lifetime fitness can beconsistently obtained. Our research will,leverage existing long-term data and produce new datato answer the following questions: (1) Which phenotypic and/or genotypic traits, mediate lifetimereproductive success (LRS)? (2) How does the relationship between chronological age (i.e., timesince birth) and bio,logical age (i.e., evaluating markers for DNA methylation in the blood) relateto LRS? (3) What are the implications of variation in,LRS for population dynamics andmanagement? First, we will evaluate whether phenotypic traits (at-sea behavior, diet, life-historyphe,nology) and/or genotype modulate individual heterogeneity in LRS. As an alternativeexplanation, we will explore whether variation in, LRS simply occurs due to random chance.Next, we will leverage existing samples to quantify similarities between chronological andbi,ological age and determine the degree to which LRS impacts these epigenetic metrics. Finally,we will synthesize the findings above b,y modeling the impact of variation in female LRS onpopulation dynamics under targeted versus random management approaches.

0,Toward the Development of a Coupled COAMPS-ROMS Ensemble Kalman Filter and Adjoint with a focus on the Indian Ocean and the Intraseasonal Oscillation,United States Department of the Navy,to Andrew Moore,"Project Summary The proposed research aims to develop a regional coupled modeling capability based on the Naval Research Laboratory’s Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). A further aim is to develop an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation system for COAMPS-ROMS using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) Interface ROMS and COAMPS with the DART which in itself will provide a new and powerful suite of tools that will be freely available to the scientific community; (2) Compare the performance of the EnKF and 4D-Var approaches to data assimilation in ocean only and atmosphere only experiments; (3) Develop a coupled model capability based on the pre-existing COAMPS and ROMS systems using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF); and (4) Investigate the merit of the EnKF approach for data assimilation in a regional coupled model. Pre-existing configurations of COAMPS and ROMS will be invaluable for the testing the combined COAMPS-DART, ROMS-DART and COAMP-ROMS-DART systems. However, the primary geographic focus for the project will be the Indian Ocean, with particular emphasis on air-sea interactions that occur during intraseasonal oscillations which are the building blocks of the monsoon systems. For this we will capitalize on the intensive field campaigns of the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability in the Year 2011 (CINDY) and the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation Experiment (DYNAMO) that took place during Oct. 2011 – Mar. 2012 for which a great deal is already understood about air-sea interactions in the region. The primary motivation for using COAMPS and ROMS is to capitalize in the future on existing tangent linear and adjoint model capabilities and 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation systems for both COAMPS and ROMS. It is envisaged that the project proposed here will pave the way for a hybrid regional coupled data assimilation system based on both the EnKF and 4D-Var approaches.less","489,355",2016,2017
0,"First-principles spin relaxation in Two-dimensional materials- proximity, twisting and doping effects",United States Air Force,to YUAN PING,"Spin relaxation and decoherence are at the heart of spintronics and quantum information science (QIS). The development of low-power spintronics devices requires long spin lifetime and diffusion length at room temperature. And harnessing the spin degree of freedom for quantum computation requires long spin relaxation and coherence time for reliable manipulation of spin qubits. Realization of these technologies require rational design of materials based on accurate prediction of spin lifetime without prior input parameters. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to develop next-generation first-principles computational platforms to accurately describe spin relaxation and decoherence processes and quantitatively determine spin lifetime including couplings with environmental degrees of freedom. The proposed research will deliver key computational techniques that can reliably predict spin and exciton lifetime through first-principles density-matrix dynamics with environmental couplings and manybody interactions. This proposed work will allow the extension of our framework from one-particle density matrix to two-particle density matrix with spin-orbit couplings, where exciton and spin dynamics can be studied simultaneously in one real-time simulation. If successful, this research will establish an important milestone for first-principles open quantum dynamics. With our methods, we will investigate the effects of proximity, twisting and doping on spin dynamics at two-dimensional (2D) interfaces. This research program will provide new and unbiased insights for spin relaxation and decoherence at 2D heterostructures, and suggest design rules of tuning and constructing new 2D interfaces which can have unprecedented potentials in spintronics and quantum information technologies.less","449,763",2021,2024
0,DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDEX TO MEASURE BODY CONDITION OF FREE-RANGING CETACEANS,United States Department of the Navy,to Shawn Noren,"Marine mammals alter behavior in response to human disturbance, including exposure to sound. Based on this, marine mammal responses to naval sonar could induce missed feeding opportunities and increased activity, which lowers energy intake and increases energy expenditure, respectively. Over the long term, body condition of individuals could decline, which can have profound population consequences. Recently photogrammetric techniques have been used with free-ranging mysticetes where variations in dorsal body widths were examined to assess nutritive condition. It remains to be validated which body component contributed to the measurable changes in body width. Morphological markers to evaluate the body condition of free-ranging, deep-diving odontocetes have yet to be identified. To fill in these knowledge gaps, we will study pilot whales at Sea World San Diego and Orlando for one year to investigate how daily caloric intake and season influences blubber topography, blubber mass, and body mass to identify the site along the body where blubber is most metabolically active in response to energy balance. Ultimately this study will provide a validated, non-invasive tool to measure the body condition of free-ranging odontocetes so that the energetic consequences of sound-induced behavioral changes can be tracked through time. At the same time data on the interrelationship between caloric intake and body condition can be incorporated into models, such as the PCAD model, to estimate the population consequences of sound exposure.less","428,595",2016,2018
0,Eddy Covariance Tower for Assessing Spatial and Temporal Variability in Subsurface Biogeochemical Processes in Coastal Wetlands and their Impacts on Water Quality,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Adina Paytan,"SummaryCoastal wetlands provide many valuable benefits to humans, including improving water quality. Currently, our ability to understand the processes that control water pollution in coastal wetlands is hampered by insufficient quantitative understanding of controlling biogeochemical processes in this complex environment and how these processes change across different wetland types. Many of the processes that control pollutant fate and transport occur below the ground through complex microbially mediated processes that vary considerably both spatially and temporally as a result of a myriad of environmental conditions (e.g., soil properties, inundation, vegetation, temperature, nutrient and carbon availability, salinity, pH and redox). The emission and/or uptake of several gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) that are consumed and/or produced in these processes can reflect the integrated subsurface biogeochemistry in wetlands. However, due to the large spatial and temporal variability in gas emissions from these systems, plot-scale estimates of gas fluxes are uncertain. The preferred technique today for accurate estimating gas fluxes, which permits calculation of seasonal and annual emissions and inventories, is the eddy correlation/covariance method. To our knowledge there are no eddy covariance towers operating in tidally impacted coastal wetlands directly connected and influenced by the ocean in California. This proposal seeks to build and operate two portable eddy covariance towers to collect continuous measurements of gas emissions in a coastal wetland in conjunction with ongoing projects to quantify the fate and transport of pollutants and nutrients. This will allow for better assessment of the processes that affect pollutant transport and water quality in coastal wetlands, inform reaction transport models, and allow for mesoscale assessment of processes operating in the wetlands. Data obtained using the eddy covariance towers will contribute to several current and future education and research projects, provide hands-on research experience opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, and be instrumental to justifying more education and process-based research in future proposals. Obtaining and operating eddy covariance towers to assess gas emissions in coastal wetlands in California and the relation of these emission fluxes to subsurface biogeochemical processes and other environmental parameters will allow for the first time to link gas dynamics on multiple spatial and temporal scales to water quality. The authentic data generated using the towers would be included in several teaching modules to increase the effectiveness of STEM teaching and learning and the operation of the towers would provide exciting research opportunities relevant to the DoD for undergraduate and graduate student, including underrepresented minorities in STEM. The data will also enable coupling of models of different scale - from nano and microscale biogeochemical reaction transport models to Earth System Models that include pollutant transport and water quality with realistic predictions of emissions from coastal/tidal wetlands, based on reliable gas emission data. The results are also be crucial for performing a quantitative economic assessment of wetland ecosystem services and identifying settings of high risk for water pollution. To our knowledge no study to date has reported gas emissions from coastal wetlands in California that accurately capture the spatial and temporal variability in these fluxes and relate them to subsurface biogeochemistry. The results of this project, facilitated by the eddy covariance towers, will improve our understanding and teaching quality on the processes that control gas emissions from coastal wetlands and how emissions are linked to subsurface processes that control pollutant fate and transport.

0,Portable Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Investigating the Resilience and Vulnerabilities of the Marine Mammal Brain,United States Department of the Navy,to Terrie Williams,"Oceanic noise including military sonar has remained one of the most controversial and debated stressors affecting marine mammal populations for over two decades. Although exposure to anthropogenic noise has been linked to numerous mass stranding events involving deep-diving cetaceans, identifying the actual cause of injury has been difficult. Scientists are just now beginning to understand how marine mammals respond to disturbance. Communication and diving behaviors essential to the survival of these animals are adversely affected by exposure to anthropogenic noise. Behavioral and tissue pathologies of beaked whales following stranding suggest cognitive disfunction. Most recently, we have reported that extreme cardiovascular changes associated with escape responses from aversive stimuli such as noise may challenge blood flow to the brain of diving mammals with potential sublethal and lethal impacts. How cetaceans and other marine mammals maintain oxygen delivery to the brain and avoid cerebral injury during these challenges is unknown, but can now be discerned with new advances in portable, non-invasive instrumentation for functional brain monitoring. In this project we will take advantage of these timely technological developments to acquire state-of-the-art instrumentation and equipment to establish a neurophysiology lab for measuring the functional biology of the marine mammal brain. Studies will range from assessing resilience to sleep and oxygen deficits to identifying vulnerabilities to man-made disturbance. This Comparative Marine Mammal Brain Lab will support investigations of blood flow, oxygenation, metabolic status, and electrical activity level of the cetacean and pinniped brain from skin surface monitors during active swimming, sleep, diving, and breath-holding. This will be accomplished by using newly available, portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), ultrasound, and electroencephalography (EEG) monitors adapted from clinical medicine to application in swimming mammals. The core instrument is a compact, submersible NIRS monitor that instantaneously records changes in brain oxygenation from changes in oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations (Brite System, Artinis Medical Systems, The Netherlands). The NIRS system will be calibrated on trained marine mammals in controlled settings via standard doppler blood flow from transcranial ultrasound (Sonosite Vet Edge II, Bothell WA) and electroencephalography (AdInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Together with our custom heartrate monitors, these instruments will enable the first integrated cardio-neural profiles of brain function for free-ranging marine mammals. Furthermore, the project represents the next step in our ongoing investigations of the impacts of noise on marine mammals with an overall objective of improving the protection of marine mammals during Naval operations. Importantly, the proposed lab is strategically located at the marine mammal facilities on the University of California- Santa Cruz (UCSC) offering unprecedented access to trained and wild marine mammals, and unique opportunities for research by students and national/international collaborators. Designated as both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and Research 1 University, UCSC is dedicated to training a diverse undergraduate and graduate STEM cohort that includes schools in the South Bay and Monterey region. Elucidating brain function during periods of oxygen and sleep deprivation is appealing to both these students and the broader public given its application to mammal conservation as well as to human neural pathologies such as insomnia, stroke, concussion or other oxygen-mediated neural injuries. Furthermore, it represents the next step in our ongoing investigations of the impacts of noise on marine mammals with an overall objective of improving the protection of marine mammals during Naval operations.less","420,157",2019,2020
0,DYNAMICALLY ORTHOGONAL TENSOR METHODS FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL NONLINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,United States Air Force,to Daniele Venturi,"In this proposal we address the challenging problem of computing the numerical solution to high-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This subject is currently on the verge of becoming central to many new application areas such as feedback control of stochastic dynamical systems, mean field games, machine learning, and optimal transport. The key idea of the proposed method relies on a hierarchical decomposition of the PDE solution space obtained by splitting the independent variables of the problem into disjoint subsets. This process, which can be conveniently visualized by binary trees or more general graphs, yields series expansions of the PDE solution that can effectively address high dimensionality. By enforcing dynamic orthogonality conditions at each level of binary tree, we convert the PDE into a system of low-dimensional coupled evolution equations for the hierarchical tensor modes. This allows us to represent and compute the temporal evolution of the PDE solution on tensor manifolds with constant rank, with no need for computationally expensive rank reduction methods. We will also develop new algorithms for dynamic addition and removal of tensor modes and address the problem of solving high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in complex geometries. The proposed work will have a significant and broad impact as it will set the foundations of a new computational paradigm that allows for simulation, control and optimization several challenging systems of interest to AFOSR and AFRL, such as non-neutral plasma dynamics (Maxwell-Vlasov-Boltzmann equations), feedback control of stochastic dynamical systems (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations), mean field control, and hypersonic dynamics in rarefied gases (Boltzmann equation).less","419,934",2020,2023

This area is also of great interest to physical oceanographers, meteorologists, climate scientists, and biologists because this is the boundary through which energy, momentum, heat, buoyancy, and gasses are exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere, and it is a rich ecosystem for a vast array of ocean organisms and marine wildlife. So while a significant oceanographic literature exists on the upper ocean it comes as some surprise that a modern acoustical characterization of this important region appears not to exist. Some of the Navy~s mixed layer transmission loss models apparently are based on results from themid-50~s Acoustic, Meteorological, Oceanographic Survey (AMOS). The purpose of this postdoctoral research appointment is to make some amend for the aforementioned acoustical shortcoming by 1) mining the literature for acoustically significant information, 2) analyzing oceanographic data from the 2005 North Pacific SPICE experiments and some previous experiments to characterize upper ocean sound speed and current field variability and 3)developing deterministic and stochastic mode based acoustic propagation models to evaluate the link between observed ocean variability and acoustic variability. Here acoustical effects are expected to be a strong function of frequency and therefore propagation between 100 Hz and a few kilohertz will be analyzed.

In real field operations, before non-lethal area weapons are applied, it is essential that we assess the risk of causing significant injury and the chance of achieving the intended suppressing/dispersing effect.

Past development ofpower converter technology for medium-voltage DC has focused on modular and resonanttechnologies. Modular converters have the advantage of achieving medium voltage with lowervoltagesemiconductor switches and have high power quality, low switching losses, and goodelectromagnetic compatibility due to a relatively low voltage within each module. Resonant powerconverters were originally developed to eliminate switching losses allowing a higher operatingfrequency which, in turn, yields good power quality and also have an inherent advantage of goodelectromagnetic compatibility due to well defined edge rates. A necessary enabling technology forpower conversion is wide band-gap semiconductor devices which eliminate switching loss due toswitch edge rates that can be 10 times that of traditional silicon semiconductors. At the same time,blocking voltages of wide band-gap devices are much higher. When operated at a higher blockingvoltage and with the higher edge rates, the dv/dt is amplified which will lead to emanateelectromagnetic compatibility problems. Thus, there is a need to study wide band-gap devices inthe context of modular and resonant structures to determine reasonable design practices. That is,for a common naval shipboard power converter, what is a good number of modular cells and towhat extent should resonant technology be used.

0,Divide-and-Conquer Bayesian Inference for Massive Space-time Data,United States Department of the Navy,to Rajarshi Guhaniyogi,"With the advancement of spatial referencing technologies such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that can identify geographical coordinates, researchers in various disciplineshave gathered an unprecedented variety of geocoded data. Consequently, identifying spatial associations with sophisticated statistical models has become an enormously active area of research. Arguably, such data is bestanalyzed by hierarchical models capturing variation at multiple levels. Massive spatio-temporal data, both in terms of the number of locations and the number of observations per location, provide scientists with an unprecedentedopportunity to hypothesize and test complex relationships. This, in turn, leads to the implementation of rather complex hierarchical models that are computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. Such models faceinfeasibility in computation when the spatial locations become massive (say 1-100 million). This team recognizes the increased computational demands in terms of statistical modeling of large multivariate spatiotemporal data and proposes a Bayesian framework to tackle a wide variety of large geostatistical and point process datasets. It also takes advantage of embarrassingly parallelizable computation for large databases. Intellectual merit: This proposal sketches a comprehensive framework for carrying out hierarchical Bayesian statistical inference on massive spatiotemporal data. The focus of the proposal is methodological rather than purely theoretical or purely applied. Thus, innovative statistical methods and theory are developed to propose the Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC) posterior as a theoretically justifiable approximation to the full data posterior. AMC posterior is obtained as the Wasserstein mean of posterior distributions on smaller subsets,referred to as subset posteriors, and provides scalable inference on massive databases. Novel theoretical results that will enhance development of AMC for rich and scalable spatio-temporal models will be explored, though AMC willalways be geared to help practitioners. The long-term goal of the PI is to develop a broad class of spatio-temporal models that would be able to answer key questions in a wide variety of experiments involving massive and complex datasets in ocean science, public health and so on. An important aspectof the proposed framework that makes it stand out is that it is model free in the sense that it can boost the scalability of any spatio-temporal model by multiple folds. In fact, the computation time of the proposed method vis-a-vis bothinferential and predictive performance, to the best of our knowledge, is exceptional. Broader impact: As the scientific community is moving into a data-driven era, there is an unprecedented opportunity to build understanding about how climate indicators change over time and space and will respond to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, there are large scale diseaseoccurrence data containing a plethora of small scale spatial variation and temporal trend which need to be explored for better public policy decisions. Although development of the proposed modeling framework is motivated by suchsubstantive questions in climatology, oceanography and public health, potential advancements in data modeling will be extremely useful in fields such as geoscience and engineering, where the fundamental goal is to use new findings to help improve society. The most appealing feature of the proposed framework is rapid computation that exploits parallel computer architecture. Further, the proposed development of open source software and associated learning material will make these methodological and computational advances accessible to researchers in applied fields.

The instrument will be the first of its kind at the Performing Institution (The University of California, Santa Cruz), and will elevate biomaterials and soft-material research there. Research programs in the Principal Investigator~s laboratory that will immediately benefit from the proposed equipment include: (1) the creation of chitin nanofiber silk self-assembled biomimetic composites (ONR effort), in which the proposed instrument will be used to map the localized mechanical properties of the chitin-silk biocomposites thereby connecting the structure of the chitin-silk biocomposites with the macroscale mechanical properties and enhancing the objectives of the project; and (2) the intracellular delivery of molecular and supramolecular ionic circuits for cyborg tissue (AFOSR effort), in which the imaging capabilities in fluid of the proposed atomic force microscope will greatly enhance the characterization suite available to the researchers to image the devices and cyborgtissue made for the project.

0,Unifying Modeling Approaches for Better Understanding and Characterizing the Effects of Sound on Marine Mammals,United States Department of the Navy,to Marc Mangel,"During the last 30 years, two major strands of mathematical modeling that can be used to understand the effects of sound on marine mammals developed. The first is Dynamic Energy Budget Theory (DEB)/Physiologically Structured Population Models (PSPM). The second strand is State Dependent Life History Theory (SDLHT) implemented by Stochastic Dynamic Programming. Each has strengths and weaknesses. DEB/PSPM is naturally suited to treat both individual life histories and population dynamics when there are feedbacks between the population and the resource base in the environment. However, it requires that parameters of the life history such as the allocation of resources to somatic tissue vs. gonadal tissue are specified exogenously to the model. SDLHT is naturally suited to predict the allocation as a function of physiological and environmental states and age of the animals, but is less effective when there are feedbacks between the environment and individuals. The overall objective of this proposal is to meld the two approaches. That is, our goal is to link the approach of SDLHT of developing behavioral and life history rules within the dynamical equations themselves with the approach of DEB/PSP that allows a framework for linking changes in the resources in the environment to the dynamics of states that much can be gained by doing so. In essence, we will construct, for the first time, a state dependent life history model in which the underlying physiology follows a DEB framework. To do so will require overcoming a variety of technical challenges, but will provide a powerful tool for predicting the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.less","294,892",2019,2022

0,Algebraic Requirements of Metrics for Multipath Routing,United States Department of the Navy,to Bradley Smith,"Sea Power 21 is the Navy~s strategic vision that is enabled by the FORCEnet architectural framework that integrates warriors, sensor""""s, networks, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a fully netted combat force. The FORCEnet vision is of a network envir""""onment supporting multimodal communication including video, audio, telemetry, and data. FORCEnet requires robust, reliable communica""""tion to all nodes in the sense that the network will function in a variety of environments, and that communication continues consist""""ently under degraded operating conditions.Unfortunately, Internet technology is currently not a good match to the requirements of t""""his vision. Specifically, the Internet is based on a destination-based routing model where each router computes the single best path"""" to each destination in a network.

0,Trust Worthy Information Storage Technology Enhanced Devices (TWISTED),Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Darrell Long,"Memory sticks are a convenient mechanism for portable data storage and transfer. Unfortunately, the embedded microcontroller required to present raw flash as a USB peripheral exposes an attack surface that can enable privilege escalation on a host computer even in the presence of tamper-resistant device designs, data encryption, and host protections such as anti-virus software. We propose Twizzler, a novel operating system for secure embedded devices, as a means to secure memory sticks against these and other threats. Twizzler is a customizable, small footprint operating system designed for low-latency and high-bandwidth access to byte-addressable persistent memory, providing a flat privilege model with no superuser role. We intend to extend the current Twizzler code base to include: a system of cryptographically signed capabilities which form the basis for security contexts, a flexible and secure replacement for roles, integrate Twizzler's content-based, verified object names with the state-of-the-art in secure boot technology, and develop secure gated APIs as a fine-grained replacement for system calls and IPC. These extensions to Twizzler's 5000 line kernel (which is already amenable to formal verification) will ensure a system based upon least privilege, data integrity, and fine-grained isolation.less","224,844",2021,2021
0,The 2023 Southern California Interactions of Low cloud and Land Aerosol (SCILLA) aircraft field expe,United States Department of the Navy,to Patrick Chuang,"Project AbstractWe propose the Southern California Interactions of Low Cloud and Land Aerosol (SCILLA) exper?iment. The over-arching, goal of this experiment is to understand the interplay among horizontalcirculation, vertical mixing, aerosols and clouds in the Sou,thern California (SoCal) Bight. Thehorizontal circulation in the Bight region underlies all of our scientific interests. Eddy circul,ationswitin the Bight are almost always present when low clouds are persistent, and the transport of pol?lution into the Bight also,depends on the regional and local circulation. The contrast between thecooler near-surface marine air with the warmer overlying cont,inental and/or free tropospheric airis crucial to the efficiency of vertical mixing, and vertical transport of aerosol into the boun,darylayer. We specifically propose to base the CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft in San Diego, CA, to per?form airborne measurements of win,ds, aerosols, and clouds for 1 month (June to July 2023), witha geographical focus on the SoCal Bight. This deployment would coincid,e with the DOE-fundedEastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE), which will deploy a range ofground-based aeros,ol and cloud sensors and samplers from Feb. 2023 to Feb. 2024, mostly in andaround San Diego. SCILLA and EPCAPE will benefit from da,ta collected by each other.The aircraft deployment will specifically answer the following questions, with the associated apriori nul,l hypotheses:1: What causes regions of elevated cloud drop number concentration in the SoCal Bight? Nullhypothesis: Transport of rem,ote continental aerosol causes the regions of elevated cloud dropnumber concentration.2: Is the continental aerosol transport mainly, from horizontal advection, or does vertical transportand mixing play a key role? Null hypothesis: Because continental air tends to,be warmer thanmarine air, continental aerosol is initially transported offshore above the boundary layer, and thusa vertical transpo,rt mechanism is needed to produce elevated cloud drop number concentration.3: What is the role of the thermodynamic properties (rath,er than aerosol properties) of continentalair in modifying clouds in the SoCal Bight? Null hypothesis: Layers of warm and dry contin,entalair above the boundary layer will significantly impact cloud properties in the SoCal Bight viaturbulent mixing of energy and mo,isture.DoD Impact: Successful identification of aerosol provenance from in situ measurements will bea powerful tool for evaluating m,odel predictive ability.

The SBP effort will examine whether, and how well, the system can be used to identify buried features away from specular (typically nadir). Buried features can include geological layers, unconformities, authgenic carbonate, or gas hydrate. The potential to image buried features away from specular is new, and is an unintended consequence of the latest generation SBP which was developed to image specular regardless of the slope of the seafloor or sub-surface reflectors. Our objectives include determining if the present-day limit of 15?? port and starboard can be expanded through access to a previously undisclosed data format, and whether improvements in visualization can improve feature detection and interpretation. The acoustic core component of our research is also related to seafloor acoustics, but in this case seafloor multibeam mapping identified areas with significant backscatter variation (10 ??? 20 dB) over distances of kilometers to 10s of kilometers at similar water depths and similar geomorphology.

0,A multi-purpose research platform for ecological and applied research on cetaceans in California,United States Department of the Navy,to Ari Friedlaender,"The rationale for the resubmission of a DURIP proposal that was highly ranked but not funded in FY19 is to develop a field-ready multi-purpose coastal research vessel that will support a number of currently-funded and proposed ONR and other DoD marine mammal research initiatives from a single platform. This platform will: diminish logistical constraints including personnel required; maximize budgets; provide field adaptability to favorable weather windows; provide both research and educational training opportunities; and advance overall research capacity within our experienced, interdisciplinary, and multi-institutional collaborative research teams both in scope and efficiency. DoD funded or planned projects this platform will support include (at least): (1) ongoing behavioral and physiological response study of delphinid species to simulated and actual navy sonar in California utilizing UAS, visual observation, biopsy, and passive acoustics methods; (2) ongoing projects to better quantify ecological interactions between baleen whales and their prey in California using motion-sensing tags and fisheries acoustics; (3) am ongoing project to develop a heart-rate monitor to collect data from baleen whales concurrent with motion-sensors to accurately estimate metabolic costs and other vital rates; (4) a proposed project to develop new longer-term multi-senor tags to be deployed on a variety of pinniped, delphinid, and baleen whale species in California; (4) ongoing and future collaborations with the Naval Postgraduate School and others to evaluate particle vector sensors to localize anthropogenic and biological sound sources; and (5) a proposed project to develop long-duration tags with algorithms to process data and transmit feeding rates of small odontocete cetaceans. The myriad methodologies used in these studies requires a strategically-configured platform that is designed to successfully conduct multi-disciplinary research while maintaining a small size, mobility both on the water and between sites, relatively low operational costs and is self-sufficient yet large enough to safely operate in coastal and offshore waters. To this end, we have used our extensive practical field expertise from previous productive and extensively published studies to design the research vessel in the current proposal. This platform would support current research at a number of academic institutions in California, facilitate collaboration with governmental agencies and NGOs conducting similar research and would also be utilized as a platform to provide unique at-sea educational opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students around Monterey Bay. The proposed platform is comparable to that proposed in 2019, with some slight modifications given improvements in technology which actually result in a slight reduction in total cost.less","203,531",2021,2022

Kyle Henderson Dr. R. Scott Erwin In response to FOA-RVKV-2013-0001 Department: AFRL/RV Research areas of interest: Space Platforms & Operations Technologies Abstract of the proposal: Emerging technologies permitting cooperation of multiple autonomous systems are suitable not only for the accomplishment of defense missions but also for the establishment of the needed infrastructure for civilian use, ranging from daily-use activities such as the internet and weather services to sporadic events, such as local emergencies and disasters. However, the presence of uncertainty in the environment, disruptions caused by multiple users, and potential failures impose significant challenges to the design of such systems. This proposal aims to generate new tools for the study of hybrid dynamical games. The framework to generate in this project will provide a formal synthesis method for optimal policies solving hybrid games. In the proposed framework, the agents (or players) will exhibit continuous and discrete dynamics, either to their own natural behavior, the structure of the network, or the family of algorithms to be employed for estimation, control, and coordination. This project is a basic research project and is not an instrument acquisition proposal or development proposal. Furthermore, the proposed research will not involve substantial involvement between the DoD and the PI. Public Purpose Statement: This proposal will develop tools capable of granting emerging mobile technologies with autonomous capabilities needed for cooperative operation over the internet, with limited resources and with requests from multiple users. The proposed tools will yield distributed algorithms that can operate in widely-used computer platforms available to the general public, such as desktop and laptop computers as well as smart cellphone technologies. The new algorithms will benefit the general public by providing solutions that permit networked operation between multiple users in applications ranging from daily-use activities (e.g., messaging over the internet, requesting medical services, tracking and requesting transportation services, and interacting with weather forecasts services) to sporadic events (e.g., rapidly acting upon local emergencies and cooperatively prepare for disasters).less","199,348",2016,2018

0,A Laboratory for Naturalistic Granular Flows,United States Department of the Army,to Emily Brodsky,"Understanding granular flows has direct implications for civil engineering, transport and landscape evolution. The majority of granular flow rheology experiments and theory describes flows composed of smooth spheres, but natural shear flows are composed of particles exhibiting a range of irregular shapes, sizes, and material properties. Integrating an understanding of the effects of different material properties and grain shape into the transition between nearly static, slow moving shear flow regimes and dilatational, fast moving shear flow regimes will allow for both an energy balance to be drawn up for granular shear flow and effective predictions of rheological behavior. We have developed and successfully used new methods and experiments to reveal fundamental differences in how grains of differing shape and composition both create and respond to acoustic perturbation during shear in dry and saturated settings, with and without wide-scale grain breakage. Armed with these new methods, we require new instrumentation to best answer the remaining question of how grain strength and shape affects granular material shear flows. (1) A new TA Instruments Discovery Hybrid Rheometer HR-2 will allow for top of the line rheological assessment. The Discovery series of rheometers employs a new magnetic bearing that reduces in-instrument friction by 70%. This is the only such bearing on the marker. Our new methods were developed using a used TA Instruments AR2000ex rheometer acquired in 2009. Our custom geometries will transfer easily to the updated Discovery model, allowing us to measure rotor torque and thus frictional strength of granular materials with much higher degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the Discovery series offers a new Tribo-Rheometry system that can be used to measure the frictional properties of solids and unconfined granular materials. (2) In order to parse the effect of grain shape and strength on bulk granular flows, it is important to characterize these properties accurately. To do this we require an in-lab mechanical tester that can evaluate the hardness, elastic modulus, acoustic properties and fracture toughness of the specific granular material we are testing. A Nanovea PB1000 mechanical tester with Micro and Nano modules allows for such characterization through indentation and scratch tests on the same scale as indentation and scratch occurs within the granular shear flow. (3) A Retsch Technology Camsizer P4 will allow for detailed grain size and shape characterization while conserving the sample, so that we can evaluate grain size and shape before and after experimentation. This is required both to draw conclusions on the effect of grain shape on bulk rheology as well as to evaluate energy loss from grain breakage and fracture. Together, these three instruments will provide a complete system for building portable, predictive constitutive relationships between grain material properties, saturation, vibrational sensitivity, acoustic output, and bulk shear flow rheology. To the best of our knowledge, no laboratory has ever combined these techniques and thus the system presents a fundamentally new capability for study naturalistic granular flows.less","157,396",2020,2021
0,"Interactions among behavioral responses of baleen whales to acoustic stimuli, oceanographic features, and prey availability",United States Department of the Navy,to Elliott Hazen,"The 2010-13 field efforts of SOCAL-BRS have been a resounding success, with a significant number of both tag deployments and controlled exposure experiments (CEEs) conducted. We have completed active prey mapping for baleen whales for most of the CEEs (2011-13 - see below). One of the initial findings was that blue whales that were surface feeding on krill showed less response to playback experiments while the feeding behavior of deep-feeding whales in the initial analysis responded when playbacks occurred (Goldbogen et al. 2013). The primary driving factor appears to be the specific mode of feeding behavior and prey availability in the water column, suggesting that blue whales in an abundance of krill may react categorically differently to acoustic stimuli than blue whales feeding on more dispersed prey. Analyses of the foraging behavior of large cetaceans have generally focused on either correlations to environmental conditions at a regional scale or observed surface behaviors conducted at a local scale. In contrast, we are measuring fine scale prey distribution, abundance, and behavior in combination with fine-scale measurements of individual whale foraging behavior within the context of CEEs. Our specific goals are to: (1) augment the current research paradigm to better understand how prey influence baleen whale foraging behavior; and (2) apply these direct measurements to explain variance in whale behavior as a function of both prey and exposure to simulated and realistic Navy MFA sonar. We propose to continue this ground-breaking contextual data collection paradigm using prey-mapping research concurrent with baleen whale tagging and MFA sonar CEEs for the final years of the SOCAL-BRS project. This will be conducted for blue whales, but with a particular focus on collecting a parallel data set for fin whales as well. Combining prey information, water column, and concurrent tag data will help us understand the ecology of blue and fin whales on fine scales. Specifically, we will measure how prey density throughout the water column influences whale foraging behavior and affects the probability of response to Navy MFA sonar. Without measurements of the prey field and oceanic conditions at the scale relevant to the tagged whale, it is impossible to separate behavioral response effects from experimental sounds versus those driven by nonanthropogenic environmental factors. We will apply spatial statistical models (e.g., generalized additive mixed models) with whale behavior as a response (e.g., feeding versus traveling, ascent rate) to examine environmental and prey effects on behavior with BRS playback condition (MFA sonar or silent control) as categorical covariates with an interaction term. These methods will help separate the experimental effects from background behavioral changes. We have conducted similar experimental work to determine the effects of oceanography and prey on other baleen whale species (e.g., (Friedlaender et al. 2009, Hazen et al. 2009, Goldbogen et al. 2013, Friedlaender et al. 2014) and have the expertise to successfully conduct similar work as part of the SOCAL experimental design. Notably, the SOCAL-BRS efforts in 2013-15 have and will continue to use operational Navy MFA sonar sources in CEEs in addition to the much smaller scaled sources used previously.less","150,320",2016,
0,RiskWatch: Linking Environmental Stressors to Security Outcomes,United States Department of the Army,to Steven Minton,"Many environmental factors can potentially affect a communitys security. In this project, we propose to develop an open source system, called RiskWatch, for harvesting data from multiple sources and linking that data to security outcomes. Relevant data can potentially be found in a wide variety of sources, including structured, numeric data sets and images published by governments and NGOs, in natural language in reports and news articles, or even in informal text aggregated from social media. The difficulty of reliably forecasting security outcomes is amplified by the fact that there are so many types of relevant data, and so many ways to express that data. RiskWatch will include capabilities for extracting and interpreting data about environmental stressors published in a wide variety of sources. To forecast security outcomes, we will employ Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), a recently developed machine learning approach that has been employed successfully for many applications, including forecasting civil unrest from open source indicators.

We propose here the integration of HgCdTe infrared emitter and detector technology with MEMS technology, which matches HgCdTe’s sensitivity and spectral resolution characteristics with an inexpensive microscale MEMS device immune to vibration and hardened to survive shocks. Initially, an optically pumped HgCdTe microcavity emitter will be coupled with an HgCdTe detector to detect agents with infrared spectral characteristics. In the second step, MEMS technology will be used to tune the emission of the HgCdTe microcavity. In the last step, both the emitter and the detector will be integrated in a monolithic architecture, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the sensor package. In Phase I, we will design the microcavity and detector components of the sensor. We will also fabricate MWIR fixed cavity emitters and MWIR high operating temperature detectors. The sensors will be used to detect chemical agents and their sensitivity and spectral capabilities will be experimentally measured.less","99,999",2008,2009

0,Novel Algorithm/Hardware Partnerships for Real-Time Nonlinear Control,United States Department of the Air Force,to Qi Gong,"The growing complexity of future military systems demands the development of high-performance nonlinear control algorithms. The goal of this proposal is to develop a specially designed software/hardware architecture to enable real-time autonomous closed-loop control of nonlinear high-dimensional dynamical systems. Following the recent success of pseudospectral (PS) computational control methods in solving highly nonlinear real-world control problems, we propose and investigate feasibility of a reconﬁgurable real-time nonlinear optimal control architecture that combines the recent advances and high eﬃciency of PS methods with the striking growth in the capabilities of modern computing hardware. The proposed closed-loop control algorithm has the potential to yield signiﬁcantly improved system performance, meet the stringent physical and engineering requirements of various Air Force systems, and easily adapt to changes in the application, environment, and control objectives. The main objectives of this proposal include: (i ) developing a reconﬁgurable real-time computational optimal control architecture, (ii ) designing an algorithmic structure that is hardware implementable, (iii ) analyzing the computational feasibility of the algorithm for high-dimensional systems, (iv ) designing the appropriate software/hardware architecture, and, (v ) testing the performance of the proposed algorithm on an example problem of autonomous aerial vehicle. BENEFIT: The real-time reconfigurable nonlinear control algorithm paired with an efficient custom designed hardware configuration is an enabling technology for managing the complexity and achieving superior performance of many Air Force warfare platforms. The results of the proposed research will particularly play a pivotal role in unmanned vehicle platforms used in both military and civilian applications. Unmanned drones and unmanned ground robots are delivering game-changing capabilities in the battlefield and are used by law enforcement agencies around the world. The realtime software/hardware partnership proposed in this project will be of great value to the unmanned vehicle industry and will be pursued as part of the future Air Force advanced technology. Elissar’s commercialization plans are focused on commercializing hardware-specific real-time reconfigurable optimal control technology by facilitating the technology transfer to Air Force platforms. Upon successful completion of Phases 1 and 2 of this STTR proposal, Elissar will pursue this endeavor by deployment of the software/harware package on small-scale unmanned ground vehicles and mid-scale unmanned aerial vehicles. In that regard, Elissar has started investigating potential industry partners who are providers of various hardware architectures. As such, two companies SRC Computers and Versa Logic have expressed their interest to partner with Elissar towards commercialization of the outcomes of Phases 1 and 2 of this STTR project, provided the result of phases 1 and 2 indicate the potential suitability of such hardware structure.

This project will develop a new architecture and protocols for wireless networks in which naming, addressing, routing, and channel access are redefined to take into account: (a) the multihop nature of channel access over wireless links, (b) the inherent interoperation between transmission scheduling and routing, (c) the dynamic nature of wireless networks, and (d) the need to transport multimedia traffic over such networks.less","99,958",2010,2011
0,Surgical Cockpit -- Multisensory/Multimodal Interfaces for Robotic Surgery,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Jacob Rosen,"The ongoing military conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan are conducted under conditions quite different from previous conflicts and demonstrate the need to deploy skilled personnel equipped with advanced technology to provide medical and surgical attention as close as possible to the point of injury. A major problem is the occasional mismatch between the type of injury and the type of surgeon available to treat it. Telerobotic surgery is a means to mediate the narrow spectrum of available front line surgical expertise. If robust telerobotic capabilities were available, an expert surgeon could perform the critical step of an operation from the continental US while the solider was located anywhere around the globe. Our objective in this proposed project is to develop a multisensory and multimodal surgical cockpit (surgical console) enabling telesurgery capabilities which expand the range of surgical expertise to the level dictated by the type and nature of wounds in the battlefield.less","96,909",2009,2010
0,Development of a Nested 4-Dimensional Variational (N4D-Var) Data Assimilation Capability for the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS),United States Department of the Navy,to Andrew Moore,"The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is one of the most widely used ocean models, both nationally and internationally. ROMS capabilities include both one-way and two-way nesting on a variety of composite and mosaic grid configurations, and a sophisticated, state-ofthe- art 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system. The objective of this project is to combine the nested capabilities of ROMS with the 4D-Var system (and the associated suite of 4D-Var tools), which will allow users to assimilate data seamlessly across nested model grids. Importantly, this will allow for the greater utility of observations from new rapid-sampling platforms, such as gliders and AUVs, and high resolution remote sensing platforms such as SWOT and SAR imagery, thereby allowing for the maximum information return from such observations when combined with data assimilation into very high resolution nested grids capable of resolving the sub-mesoscale circulation. This project will extend the current separate ROMS 4D-Var and nested modeling capabilities, and allow assimilation of ocean observations across multiple one-way and two-way nested grids. The project is of considerable significance because it will open the door to data assimilation atthe sub-mesoscale and in the littoral zone, and allow seamless data assimilation from the gyrescale (~ 1000's km) to the small scales (~ 1km or less) that characterize the near-shore circulation. This capability will be unique within the ocean modeling community, and expand considerably DoD capabilities in the realm of ocean data assimilation, nowcasting, and forecasting across multiple scales.less","89,881",2018,2020

Although there have been significant advance""""s in the observation and measurement of marine mammal behavior, there is comparatively little understanding of the respiratory and c""""ardiovascular adaptations critical for managing hypoxia, hypercapnia, and inert gases during diving. Furthermore, there is limited i""nformation regarding the integration of physiological and behavioral mechanisms comprising flight responses in these diving mammals."" The disruption of normal marine mammal diving behavior, display of opposing physiological responses, and the associated potential f""or developing gas-bubble disease or DCS remain the leading hypotheses proposed as a cause-effect relationship between mid-frequency"" active (MFA) sonar use and mass stranding events. To address this, a major goal of the Marine Mammal Biology (MMB) program is to di""""scover the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that permit marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations, and to pro""vide a better understanding of the potential risk of these animals developing gas-bubble disease or DCS when exposed to MFA or other"" ocean noise. To provide the best science to investigate these issues, we propose to conduct a workshop to review and assess the"" current state of knowledge regarding the risks posed to physiological and biochemical mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive for extended periods to deep depths while avoiding DCS. The workshop will specifically address the potential risk of animals develo""ping gas-bubble disease or DCS when exposed to MFA sonar, and will evaluate the potential for other physiological risks. The worksho""p will consist of a small number (approx. 15) of selected participants who can contribute their expertise on the state of the resear""ch.

0,Mathematically Rigorous Methods for Determining Software Quality,United States Department of the Navy,to DeLesley Hutchins,"Current software development and testing methodologies are inadequate for validating software in mission-critical applications. As Dijstra famously stated: ""testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence."" When lives and national security is at stake, there is a need for mathematically rigorous techniques that can verify the absence of bugs. We propose to develop a framework for software verification and validation using the technique of type-based static analysis. Type theory, and static analysis using types, has been extensively studied in the academic literature, but most of that research has not yet been used to build real-world tools for software verification. Type-based static analysis is both powerful and mathematically rigorous, and offers significant advantages in terms of scalability and modularity over competing techniques. Our proposed framework will be capable of analyzing code written in C, C++, Java, C#, and other languages, and will be able to analyze both source code and compiled binaries. The framework will use automatic type inference to derive appropriate safety properties for common programming patterns, but will also allow the user to supply annotations that guide the analysis algorithms when proving more difficult properties.less","69,981",2010,2011
0,Infrared Transparent Glass Ceramics with Near-Zero Thermal Expansion,United States Department of the Navy,to Philip Lam,"The thermal shock resistance of current mid-infrared window and dome materials is insufficient for some high speed flight application due to their relatively large thermal expansion. Leveraging our extensive experience on infrared materials, L2 Tech, Inc and University of California-Santa Cruz propose to develop a new glass ceramic material with high mid-infrared transmission and low emissivity at elevated temperature. The material has 45-60% (in volume) crystals that have negative thermal expansion. It balances with the positive thermal expansion of the surrounding glass to give a combined Near-Zero Thermal Expansion of less than 0.5 ppm/K over a wide temperature range from 0-600 oC, and has superior thermal shock resistance. By specially designing the composition, the material will have very good mechanical properties and high chemical erosion resistance.

0,SeaTag-RC: A Remote Releasable Instrument Carrier for Marine Mammal Tagging,United States Department of the Navy,to Marco Flagg,"While tagging marine mammals with electronic data recorders is common, recovering the instruments or data remains problematic. This proposal develops a RRD (remote release device) using a multi-pronged strategy. Development is accelerated by engineering the design substantially from proven components in our design library, yielding a lab and field tested RRD prototype by the end of phase-1. In cooperation with UCSC, RRD prototypes will be placed on elephant seals for re-location excursions from Monterey to Ano Nuevo, a trip during which the animals dive extensively and to near the maximum 2000m depth rating of RRD. RRD will be a low-profile device measuring about 3”x4”x0.625”. We will test two release mechanisms, including a fusible link and a propellant wafer; both designs resulting in energetic release to clearly separate from the animal. Release is initiated by the transmission of a secure ID, and RRD acknowledges commands and provides a homing capability. Two power systems will be evaluated; one based on rechargeable or primary batteries, and another using ‘stored solar power’, in which photovoltaic cells are combined with aerogel capacitors (super capacitors) to store energy during the animal’s surface intervals. This may eliminate batteries and support ‘indefinite’ mission duration and device re-use.less","69,392",2009,2010
0,State Estimation for Generalized Linear Dynamical Networks,United States Department of the Navy,to Alyson Fletcher,"Summary Methods that can systematically characterize the structure and dynamics of neural circuits are fundamental to understanding information processing in the brain, including perception and cognition. However, unlocking the connectivity and interactions of large neural populations from limited measurements is dauntingly complex. From a mathematical perspective, the key challenge is that neural populations as observed through modern technologies such micro-electrocortiography ( ECoG) are, in essence, high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with large numbers of hidden states. Generically, estimation and identification problems in high-dimensional dynamical systems suffer from the curse of dimensionality – the complexity of performing many computations grows exponentially in the state dimension. To address these challenges, the broad goals of this proposal are twofold: develop succinct mathematical models that can describe high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with a particular focus on these systems as the arise in neural cortical circuits; and develop computationally scalable algorithms that can identify these models from limited observations including ECoG data. Toward this end, the key insight that we pursue in this project is that neural systems – and many other high-dimensional systems in engineering and science – can be described as networks of low-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with linear, memoryless interactions. We call these networks Generalized Linear Dynamical Networks (GLDNs). These models can readily capture a wide range of complex phenomena including neural systems. At the same time, we argue that the models are amenable to decomposition methods that enable tractable and scalable approaches for high-dimensional inference and system identification – the critical task in neural modeling. The focus of this short-term project (approximately one year) is on developing the foundational algorithmic and theoretical methods for GLDNs. The focus on the first year is on state estimation. The two challenges we address in this work are handling the nonlinearities and making the algorithms work on very large scale. The PI will leverage existing works based on graphical models for static problems where she was able to obtain scalable algorithms for high-dimensional nonlinear estimation algorithms with provable guarantees. The study of state estimation can in turn be used for subsequent work in system identification and work targeted specifically to neural systems. 1less","67,974",2015,
0,Towards Attack-Resilient Autonomous Cyber Defense,United States Department of the Army,to Alvaro Cardenas,"Autonomous cyber defense is a growing area promising a fast and predictable recovery of a network aftern an intrusion alert. These systems operate in an adversarial environment and advanced threats have all the incentives to attack not only the tactical network but also the autonomous cyber defense mechanism to achieve their objectives. Automated responses are double-edged in that they can be very good at protecting the system from benign and known anomalies but they may be exploited against an intelligent adversary to push the system into an undesirable state. In this project we plan to develop the foundations and techniques of a reasoning framework that applies adversarial thinking to autonomy used for attack recovery functions. Our main objective is to develop theoretical and practical foundations for adversarial thinking. Our first objective is to systematically analyze the potential threats, and the second objective is to identify research directions for creating attack-resilient autonomous agents responding to intrusion alerts. To analyze the threats, we need to consider both (1) the theoretical tools for developing autonomous agents (such as threats against Reinforcement Learning) as well as (2) the unique threats when implementing these general solutions in a computer network. One key observations is that autonomous cyber defense mechanisms are feedback control systems, so we can leverage several techniques (attacks and defenses) proposed in the last two decades from the literature on securing cyber-physical systems. We are particularly interested in defending against enchanting attacks. In an enchanting attack, an attacker wants to drive the tactical network under protection to an undersirable state by exploiting the autonomous actions of our agents. These types of attacks represent a unique threat surface that autonomous agents might create in tactical computer networks (it might give the adversary a way to control the state of the network). This threat model is potentially more realizable than the physical perturbations of cameras proposed by previous work.less","60,000",2023,2024
0,Subsurface Biogeochemical Processes in Coastal Wetlands - Impacts on Water Quality,United States Department of the Army,to Adina Paytan,"Wetland ecosystems are globally important and provide multiple ecosystem services (water quality improvement, nutrient retention, flood control, fisheries, tourism and recreation). These systems and particularly coastal wetlands are, however, comparatively understudied and underrepresented in subsurface biogeochemical models yet processes in the subsurface directly affect groundwater and surface water quality with implications to humans and the natural environment. To address this critical knowledge-gap our objective is to develop a mechanistic understanding and ability to model the coupled hydrological, geochemical, and biological processes controlling water quality in wetlands and the implications of these processes for watersheds commonly found in coastal regions of the United States. Work proposed here will take place at representative sites in Elkhorn Slough a coastal wetland in California. These sites represent a range of conditions representative of tidal and impounded coastal wetlands with different nutrient loads and can provide a complete and broadly representative mechanistic understanding of subsurface processes that will allow for model application in diverse wetlands. We specifically identified two common thematic knowledge gaps that inhibit ability to predict controls on water quality: (1) in-depth understanding of the molecular-scale biogeochemical processes that affect C, N, Fe, and S and contaminant speciation in the subsurface, and (2) in-depth understanding of hydrologically driven biogeochemical controls on the mass transfer of C, N, Fe, S and contaminants. We will conduct field studies to shed light on specific biogeochemical processes and the impact of hydrological controls and incorporate the results in a hydro-biogeochemistry reaction-transport-model.less","60,000",2020,2021
0,Infrastructure upgrade for DoD-relevant research on long-lived marine vertebrates,United States Department of the Navy,to Roxanne Beltran,"Agency Program Officer: Dr. Michael WeiseDirectorate: Office of Naval Research, Marine Mammals and Biology program (ONR MMB)SummaryMarine megafauna in general and marine mammals in particular are challenging to study. However, a few systems including the northernelephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are particularly amenable to research. The elephant seal colony at Año Nuevo Reserve has been studied for over four decades with support from many agencies, including the NOPP, NOAA, NSF, the Office of Naval Research and SERDP. Innovations in research methodologies and the long-term monitoring of elephant seals have played a critical role in facilitating scientific investigations of other marine mammal species, including threatened, endangered, and at-risk species that are of deep concern to the DoD operations. Additionally, the proximity of Año Nuevo Reserve to the UC Santa Cruz campus enables undergraduate andgraduate students to participate in the world-class northern elephant seal research program. We are requesting a facilities upgradethat will significantly increase the capabilities of this unique research program. Specifically, we are asking to purchase an electric pickup truck, a refrigerated centrifuge, and an Argos receiver system. We currently transport students and researchers in an aging gasoline-powered pickup truck purchased with ONR funds in 2005. It is not only expensive to operate, but gasoline used releases 13.08 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, equating to 9 years of carbon dioxide emissions budget for a single person. We propose to purchase a 2022 Ford all-electric truck to enable the resighting of tagged animals, censuses, instrument deployments, and translocations of elephant seals across Monterey Bay, in addition to the purchase of a Wildlife Computers Argos Mote. Currently,all Argos data are received via Argos satellites that are overhead for only 20 minutes 6-8 times per day. A Wildlife Computers Motewould allow real-time data from any Argos transmitter within 90 km of its location. While we propose the acquisition of a single Mote receiver, this unit will be used to determine the efficacy and feasibility of developing a larger integrated Argos receiver arrayaround Monterey Bay, which would provide 24-7 real-time data acquisition for any Argos tag deployed on any species in the region. Finally, a refrigerated centrifuge is necessary to support the increasingly complex physiological studies that are now being carried out with elephant seals at the Año Nuevo colony. The proposed infrastructure investment will enable critical DoD-relevant basic research, facilitate student engagement, and increase UCSC#s ability to train the next generation of under-represented students that will join the STEM and/or DoD workforce.

0,"Postnatal development of diving physiology: A review to examine vulnerability of immature beaked whales to hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis and decompression sickness (DCS) during their flight response",United States Department of the Navy,to Shawn Noren,"Under normal circumstances, the exceptionally long and deep dives of beaked whale species do not pose a risk for these animals because of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. However, recently there have been multi-species mass strandings of marine mammals that were coincident with naval sonar exercises, which included beaked whale species exhibiting decompression sickness (DCS) like symptoms. The mechanism behind this pathology is still unclear. Moreover, immature beaked whales are undoubtedly the most at risk of suffering from DCS because their small body size theoretically results in higher mass-specific oxygen utilization rates compared to larger conspecifics. While at the same time, the physiology that supports breath-hold diving and submerged swimming may require postnatal development, as has been shown in other cetaceans. Because little is known about the magnitude or duration of postnatal development required to achieve mature diving physiology in beaked whale species, a review of the postnatal development in other marine mammal species will be undertaken. The magnitude and duration of the postnatal development of all aspects of the oxygen pathway will be reviewed across species in relation to maternal dependency period, habitat, and diving behavior to predict postnatal development patterns for beaked whale species. This review provides a cornerstone to ascertain the propensity of immature beaked whales to suffer from hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis and DCS when engaged in a ""flight response"" associated with exposure to anthropogenic noise. This research supports the number one priority identified in Table 1 Overview of Highest Priority Research Recommendation in Southall (2009), which is to improve the ability to understand biologically-significant effects to sound exposure.less","47,396",2018,2019

0,Chitin Nanofiber Silk Self Assembled Biomimetic Composites,United States Department of the Navy,to Marco Rolandi,"In biological systems, the majority of structural materials and architectures (e.g. bone, teeth, wood, arthropod cuticles, crustacean exoskeletons, and mollusk shells) are composites that are formed from a dispersed phase, typically biomacromolecules hierarchically assembled into a fibrous form, and a matrix. For example, in arthropods, crustaceans, and mollusks, there is a dispersed phase of chitin nanofibers within a matrix of silk-like proteins. In wood, the dispersed phase is mainly cellulose, whereas in bone and teeth the dispersed phase is collagen. Biocomposites also serve as templates for mineralization to yield the final material. For example, the teeth of the mollusk chiton have magnetite mineralized on a template of chitin nanofibers, and the club of the Stomatopod Dactyl shrimp is composed of chitin nanofibers mineralized with hydroxyapatite. Rigid biological systems have frequently served as inspiration for biomimetic synthetic composites. One of the challenges in creating biomimetic composites, though, is recreating the complex hierarchical structure that is responsible for the outstanding properties of the composite. The hierarchical structure spans from the nanoscale to the microscale and that has been difficult to produce in large scale with top-down fabrication methods. In contrast, the self-assembly of biomolecular components with tailored molecules has proven useful. Biomineralized self-assembled composites have even been demonstrated. An appealing strategy for creating biomimetic composites is to exploit the self-assembly of ready to use natural components that do not require synthesis in vitro. In this regard, the Principal Investigator has recently discovered that a solution of chitin and silk in hexafluoroisopropranal self assembles into a biocomposite of 3 nm alpha-chitin nanofibers embedded in a silk matrix. This is the first self-assembled composite of its kind that closely mimics natural composites. The Principal Investigator has also explored crosslinking chitosan, a deacetylated form of chitin, with L-dopa before integrating it with silk, in order to mimic the chitin beak of squid, in which the density of cross-linked histidine residues in the proteins in squid beaks has been shown to dictate stiffness. In the proposed research, the PI will investigate the structure-processing-properties relationship of L-Dopa cross-linked chitin-silk based composites. Specifically, he will investigate the microstructure of the chitin-silk composites as a function of cross-linking. He will also characterize the mechanical properties (tensile, hardness) of the chitin-silk cross-linked composites as a function of cross-linking. The outcomes of these fundamental studies will be a series of phase diagrams where the chitin-silk cross-linking conditions can be more systematically related to materials on a time-dependent basis. These will form the basis for future devices and functions generated from these approaches. NOTE: This research project started under ONR Award N000141410724 to The University of Washington on 13-June-2014. It was planned to be a three year effort. In late 2015, the Principal Investigator assumed a position at The University of California, Santa Cruz. Therefore, a new award is being recommended to start at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to allow the PI to conduct a portion of the project there. The PI has left trainees behind at The University of Washington, so ONR Award N000141410724 will run to its original completion there, but with a reduction of $25,412 funds from the original total award value.less","25,412",2016,
