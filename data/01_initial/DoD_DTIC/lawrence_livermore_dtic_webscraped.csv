0,High Performance Energetic Propellant Ingredient Process Research and Development,United States Department of the Navy,to Pascal Dube,"CL-20 is the most powerful conventional explosive known, but its high cost has limited its adoption in a range of potential applications. Par of the challenge in making these materials is the complexity of the reaction used to prepare the polycyclic cage. The complexity of this reaction makes it difficult to have insight into the reaction and to improve it. Additionally, several of the intermediates and reaction byproducts are challenging to analyze with typical analytical techniques. In the research program proposed, we would apply cutting edge analytical techniques in combination with flow chemistry techniques to collect detailed data about the relevant chemical reactions, while also enabling access to process conditions that would not be accessible using batch conditions.less","1,981,016",2017,2021
0,Expedited Transition of Propulsion Modeling & Simulation Capability,Missile Defense Agency,to Dan Jones,"A multivariate interface/data structure for insensitive munitions (IM) applications, technology and hazards/effects analysis can facilitate transition of propulsion modeling and simulation (M&S) capability. Expected benefits are reduced testing and overall acquisition cost and increased safety margins. Use of M&S can provide knowledge points not achievable with limited pass-fail testing. During Phase I, the M&S toolset for system mitigation of IM hazards was assessed to be ready for expedited transition. The Phase II effort will study bullet/fragment impact protection during transport, as well as mitigation of thermal effects on a propulsion stack from jet fuel fires in the launching system. The intended products are additions to the multivariate knowledge base including mitigation technology and the separately funded transition of a test-validated propulsion mitigation M&S analysis toolset in order to reduce overall cost of a specific missile acquisition program.less","1,169,100",2008,2010

0,Development of powder bed printing (3DP) for rapid and flexible fabrication of energetic material payloads and munitions,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Susana Carranza,"This program will demonstrate how additive manufacturing technologies can be used with reactive and high energy materials to create rapid and flexible fabrication of payload and munitions. Our primary approach to this problem will be to use powder bed binder printing techniques to print reactive structures. The anticipated feedstock will consist of composite particles containing all reactant species. Each printed particle can act as its own chemical cell, negating the need for particle-to-particle diffusion of reactants. Because structural integrity is a goal of this proposed work, an infiltrate will be utilized to fill voids and reinforce the printed structure. The initial focus will be on melt infiltrating the structure with solders or brazing alloys. Their low melting temperatures allow infiltration without diminishing the stored chemical energy in the printed reactive material. Reactive payloads formed by additive manufacturing can improve the payload effect/mass ratio by replacing structural elements in the munition that would otherwise be inert. In the future, we anticipate additive manufacturing may be able to create new, highly-controllable and tailored payload effects that would not be possible with traditional munitions. The program will focus on demonstrating the fundamental building blocks and techniques that can facilitate this development process.less","149,992",2016,2017
0,Portable Cell Maintenance System for Rapid Toxicity Monitoring,United States Department of the Army,to Peng Zhou,"The health and safety of civilians and deployed troops critically depends on the ability to detect a broad range of toxic contaminants in drinking water. There is also a generally perceived need for an accurate, reliable, and cost-effective measurement system for assuring the safety of drinking water, i.e., a simple test to determine ""lack of contamination"" in military, civilian, and industrial settings. This proposal addresses these important needs by demonstrating the feasibility of a system comprising a novel and innovative, low-cost, small-size, microfluidic chip-based cell maintenance cartridge (CMC), and a portable cell maintenance system (CMS) capable of housing multiple CMCs. The proposed CMC/CMS system will be capable of optimally maintaining multiple vertebrate cell types during transport, storage, and use while supporting both optical and electrical assay formats. Specifically, the proposed project will establish on-chip assays for cell viability, vitality, and function in order to assess the ability of the CMC to optimally maintain multiple cell types for a period of three days in Phase I and significantly longer in Phase II. Additionally, the CMC/CMS system will enable the development of powerful cellular assays based on both primary cells and next-generation engineered cells designed for sensing applications.less","100,000",2004,2005

The structural substrate will be a high performance discontinuous graphite fiber reinforced Mg AZ31 metal matrix composite manufactured by pressure infiltration casting. MetGraf Mg composites have the following attractive attributes for structural substrates: CTE precisely matched to the Invar-like nanolaminate replica. High specific stiffness High thermal conductivity High thermal stability Low manufacturing cost This combination will result in a robust stiff, lightweight (< 8 kg/m2 areal density) meter class mirror. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed a sputter deposition process, which has been applied to the production of high quality mirror replicas. LLNL will produce ~400 Ã¬m thick Invar-like 250 mm convex and flat nanolaminate replicas for this project with expected expansion coefficients of 2 to 4 ppm/K. MMCC will upgrade its graphite fiber preform to produce highly uniform materials that, after pressure infiltration, results in exact CTE matches to the nanolaminate.

0,Expedited Transition of Propulsion Modeling & Simulation Capability,Missile Defense Agency,to Dan Jones,"Industry needs a high-fidelity propulsion modeling and simulation capability for Insensitive Munitions (IM) hazard analysis in order to quantify the trade space for performance vs. safety. Full-scale testing of large propulsion systems (greater than 20 inch diameter) is too costly and more importantly, not practical due to lack of sufficiently large instrumented test facilities. Currently DoD/OUSD (AT&L) undertook a Weapons and Munitions M&S initiative as a portion of their Systems Acquisition Portfolio for Land Warfare and Munitions (LW&M), which will result in an initial capability during FY 08-10. This STTR proposal will provide a parallel, multivariate user interface/data organization structure including appropriate testing protocols to enable industry to integrate the government M&S capability into their programs and technology bases. The primary focus will the development/growth of engineering models/codes to address primarily impact hazards from fragments and bullets. The secondary focus in later years will be on thermal hazards. The proposed interface/data organization structure will connect IM-related applications and industry technology bases to the government M&S toolset capabilities and growth plans in the functional domains of physics, numerics, databases and validation methods. It will include linkages to the LW&M initiative's resources, venues and policy/control points.less","99,992",2007,2008
0,Efficient Multi-Scale Radiation Transport Modeling,United States Department of the Air Force,to Shashi Aithal,"Radiative transfer is of special importance in several applications from re-entry flows to rocket engines and air-breathing engines. Solution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), which is a complex integro-differential equation, places stringent requirements on the computational resources. Additionally, radiative transfer can occur over widely differing spatial scales further increasing the computational complexity. Hence efforts have to be made to develop efficient numerical algorithms and solvers to address issues of accuracy and computational time. Furthermore, there is a need to develop accurate physical models that include real gas effects such as non-ideal equations of state and frequency-dependent radiative properties for the participating medium. In this research, HyPerComp proposes to develop a high-performance, multi-physics, multi-scale computational platform to address a large class of problems involving radiative transfer. PWRFlow, an in-house unstructured, parallel continuum flow solver currently solves the RTE for turbulent reacting flows. This capability will be extended to solve the RTE from the optically thin to thick limits. Use of computationally efficient hybrid methods and accurate physical models will be developed as a part of this research effort. BENEFIT: The main focus of this STTR is to develop an understanding of the role of multi-scale radiative transport in turbulent reacting flows. Work done under this research will have applications in several technologies critical in aerospace propulsion, automobile engines and plasma processing reactors. Additionally, manufacturers of gas turbines and combustors along with the energy industry using coal/oil-fired furnaces will benefit from this research. HyPerComp envisions the development of a commercial suite of software tools to assist in combustion-based applications for general propulsive and chemical engineering applications. It is anticipated that such a commercial tool will be ready for marketing on the successful completion of Phase II of this STTR.less","99,992",2008,2009
0,Innovative Methodologies for Manufacturing of Lethality Test Articles,Missile Defense Agency,to John Brough,"The experimental validation of the DoDs weapon systems is at the cornerstone of national security considerations. The structural requirements for the targets utilized impose a severe cost and lead time burden due to the limitations imposed by the traditional manufacturing processes currently used. Novel manufacturing methods for metal alloys have been established in the past years, but they have yet to be incorporated into the DoDs target manufacturing supply chain. Our extensive experience with powder consolidation, parts manufacturing and additive manufacturing (AM) has led us to identify a combination of technologies to rapidly produce the required test items at a fraction of the current cost. We thus believe that 3D printing holds the potential for the production of printed green parts suitable for microwave (MW) sintering to consolidate them into materials of near theoretical density and strength. Our proposal will outline the advantages and limitations of each method, a robust work plan to address the current challenge and a solution to provide an expedited and low-cost manufacturing process for MDAs lethality articles. Beyond this specific application, we foresee a market in specialized industrial parts where the machining costs are elevated, all of which MATSYS will become a commercial supplier.Approved for Public Release | 18-MDA-9522 (23 Feb 18)less","99,973",2018,2018

King from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) as QuesTeks academic partner, proposes expand the computational Materials by Design technology by developing an Integrated Model Toolkit that enables the modeling of AM process by predicting the local composition, microstructure (including porosity and other defects), residual stresses and/or distortion, and mechanical properties for stainless steel 316L aerospace parts. Our approach is based upon computationally-implemented mechanistic models to predict process-structure and structure-property relationships at length-scales ranging from inter-atomic bonding, to stable/meta-stable phase equilibria, to macro-segregation during solidification. The focus of the Phase I program will be to determine the architecture of the ICME based tool set and define the existing and needed models to fill this architecture. LLNL, whose strategic initiative entitled Accelerated Certification of Additively Manufactured Metals, has extensive experience in development of process models for laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of 316L stainless steel and experimental measurements of residual stress, laser material interaction etc. Prof. G.

0,Quantifying Uncertainty in the Mechanical Performance of Additively Manufactured Parts Due to Material and Process Variation,United States Department of the Navy,to Azadeh Keshtgar,"TDA has teamed up with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as its research institution collaborator to address the target STTR topic objective of quantifying the uncertainties in the mechanical behavior of the AM parts. To quantify uncertainties by minimizing both the computational burden and expensive testing and also overcoming the IP concerns, we propose a novel approach with three layered interconnected framework to include: fast simulations scaling between local model and full scale model, adaptive surrogate modeling using dimensionless variables, and critical supporting experiments.During Phase I efforts, TDA plans to develop a fully automated thermal-mechanical finite element numerical simulation tool to predict AM part intrinsic properties for variable input parameters. We follow an ICME framework for multi-scale AM simulation module consisting of a coarse-grain module for component level processing and a high fidelity module capturing material local behavior. We propose using an innovative data-driven stochastic framework to characterize the effect of material and process uncertainties on the mechanical performance of additively manufactured parts by focusing on Selective Laser Melting process (SLM) and Titanium alloy. We propose analytical approaches to predict of mechanical performance and also quantify uncertainty in the selected few mechanical performance parameters using a novel surrogate modeling technique.less","79,937",2016,2017
0,Development of a Computational Method for Prediction of After-Burning Effect,United States Department of the Navy,to John Croghan,"The research objective is to develop a fully functional computational method for prediction of the after-burning effect of different fuels in a wide range of temperature, pressure, and turbulence regimes. Achievement of the objective requires understanding and modeling of key phenomena including (a) post-detonation response of the fuels, (b) near-field coupling of detonation products with particulates, (c) compressibility influences on dispersal of fuels, (d) gas-particle instability mechanisms and turbulent mixing, and (d) diffusion-limited and kinetics-limited ignition, burn and quenching mechanisms for elevated temperature, pressure and cross-flow. A predictive capability would be useful to a broad spectrum of military and non-military applications, including warhead design and lethality/vulnerability assessments. An important commercial application is avoidance of dust explosion accidents causing deaths, injuries and property damage/loss in industries as diverse as mining, agricultural grain storage and wood and plastics processing.less","69,956",2010,2011

0,Environmentally Benign Impact Initiated Devices Using Energetic Sol-Gel-Coated Flash Metal Multilayers,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Alexander Gash,"Medium caliber munitions are currently detonated through the use of impact-sensitive (stab) detonators. Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing pin through the closure disc of the device and into the stab-initiating mixture (NOL-130). Current stab mixtures, as well as primer and igniter compositions, contain hazardous materials such as lead styphnate, lead azide, barium nitrate, antimony sulfides, and tetrazene. Alternative impact-initiated devices (IID) that do not use lead or other environmentally hazardous materials are critically needed.The objective of this project was to develop new IIDs that do not contain hazardous materials and that have performance characteristics similar to or an improvement over the current stab compositions through the use of environmentally acceptable, energetic, sol-gel-coated, flash metal multilayer nanocomposites.less",Summarize,,
0,Cyber-Security Integrity For Electric Grid Facilities Management,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Daniel Quinlan,"Firmware used in the control and monitoring of the U.S. electric grid and Building Automation Systems (BASs) are rarely, if ever, analyzed by end-users for potential vulnerabilities prior to being deployed. This is of concern to Department of Defense (DoD) Energy and Water (E&W) operations who maintain many such control systems and BASs. Should a firmware vulnerability in a control system be exploited, it could lead to disastrous consequences such as failure of systems, destruction of equipment, and potential compromise of DoD base infrastructure.This project successfully developed and demonstrated a suite of automated tools for the analysis of binary executables to identify potential vulnerabilities prior to deployment within electric control systems at DoD base facilities.less",2016,â,
0,Safe and Environmentally Acceptable Sol-Gel-Derived Pyrophoric Pyrotechnics (SEED Project),Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Randy Simpson,"The current pyrophoric decoy flare is composed of iron (Fe) coated onto steel foil. The high surface area to mass ratio of the foils makes them flutter after being ejected from the aircraft, taking on the appearance of a moving hot cloud when several decoys are ejected in rapid succession. The current production process relies heavily on the use of hot caustic and toxic leaching solutions to prepare the high surface area, porous, pyrophoric iron metal. These solutions are corrosive and represent both a safety and environmental hazard.The objective of this SERDP Exploratory Development (SEED) project was to demonstrate use of the ""sol-gel"" methodology for producing nanostructured energetic materials (i.e., pyrotechnics), while minimizing or eliminating the human health and environmental hazards associated with their current fabrication process. Application of this technique to the manufacture of pyrophoric flares will eliminate the need for caustic and toxic leaching solutions and improve performance of the final products.less",Summarize,,
0,Tool for Cyber Secure Integration of DER to the Risk Management Framework,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Hannah Burroughs,"Improved energy efficiency and resiliency is a key goal of the Department of Defense (DOD) facilities throughout the country. Distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrid technologies can address this need by diversifying energy supply and operational requirements, as well as reducing interconnected infrastructure dependencies. However, these devices can expose deployment locations to new cyber threat pathways. Additionally, whenever new devices are installed into the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) at DOD facilities, they are inventoried and evaluated as part of the DOD Risk Management Framework (RMF), which can be a time-consuming and onerous process. This demonstration project, CINDER, will address these issues by streamlining ICS analysis in the RMF specific to DER management systems for the energy managers and civil works leaders for DOD facilities, enabling faster authorization and full integration. It will also allow for the automation of accurate asset inventories at secure locations for Operational Technologies (OT), and provide rapid assessment of assets on the communication network, the baseline setting, and design of appropriate controls.less",2020,â,

0,Biological Ligands and Materials Design for Rare Earth Recovery and Separation,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Yongqin Jiao,"Rare earth elements (REE) are essential for high-tech, low-carbon technologies, such as magnets for wind turbines and electric motors. China currently controls the REE supply chain, which hinders growth of renewable energy technologies in the U.S. and Europe and creates risk in defense industry supply chains. Rare earth production schemes from both primary ores and secondary sources involve a series of chemically intense and environmentally taxing procedures with separating individual REEs from each other representing the most challenging steps. Solvent extraction, while effective for industrial scale operations, is not effective for low-grade feedstock and poses a severe environmental burden. Ion exchange chromatography presents an alternative approach for achieving high-purity REEs but is generally cost-prohibitive for scaling. The goal of this project is to develop novel REE-binding ligands coupled with materials design to enable cost-effective and organic solventâfree REE recovery and separation from electronic wastes (E-wastes). If successful, the project expects to achieve REE separation with efficiency similar to traditional ion exchange chromatography but with reduced cost and environmental footprint.less",2022,â,

Primarily this energy savings is derived from increased visibility to energy efficiency choices and losses with improved observability to operators and facilities. However, in most of those data management systems, utility meter data are used for âbilling purpose onlyâ instead of âbilling and monitoring purposes.â In addition, the meter data (e.g., data in the MDMS) are not well integrated with other measurement data (e.g., data in Utility Monitoring and Control Systems). The economic and technical values of smart meters and the usefulness of âbigâ smart meter data are not fully realized. The research team, which includes Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the University of Michigan (UM), and XENDEE, with the support from White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), will demonstrate the Facility Energy Saving and Securing Technology (FEST) using multi-source data with the following capacities:To quantitatively evaluate success, we will use traditional efficiency, reliability/resiliency, and security metrics, such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and Average Service Availability Index (ASAI).
