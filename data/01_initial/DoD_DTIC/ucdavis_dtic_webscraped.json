Total costs are estimated at $7,500,000.00 over 5 years with\"\" 3-year base period of $4,500,000 and 2-year option period of $3,000,000. Memory for specific events (~episodic memory~) and knowl\"edge accrued across multiple events (~event schemas~) play powerful roles in human cognition. Neuroscience research has strongly lin\"ked these abilities to interactions between the hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and a posterior medial (PM) neo\"cortical network. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the neural processes that support representation of event schemas and episodic memory could be of enormous significance to basic neuroscience. Achieving this goal would have significant implications for DOD\" capabilities, such as the development of autonomous systems capable of rapid extraction of information about temporal and spatial r\"\"elations, causality, and intentionality from complex data streams. At present, however, there is insufficient knowledge about how ev\"\"ents are segmented, learned, and retrieved in the human brain, and the field lacks an appropriate computational framework to explain\"\" existing data. To address these challenges, we propose an integrative computational cognitive neuroscience approach to understandin\"g event representation and episodic memory.The centerpiece of this project is an innovative neurocomputational framework called St\"ructured Event Memory (SEM). SEM integrates the strengths of three different, but related, approaches~Latent Cause Models, Event Seg\"\"mentation Theory, and the Complementary Learning Systems Model~to explain how interactions between the hippocampus, vmPFC, and PM ne\"\"twork support event representation and episodic memory. The architecture of SEM is scalable, it is meaningfully tied to neural mecha\"\"nisms, and it provides a principled and parsimonious account of a diverse range of processes, including: schema formation, event seg\"\"mentation, context in memory and language, episodic memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and updating, prediction, and mental\"\" simulation. SEM is especially innovative in that it is designed to learn about the structure of the world, in terms of temporal, ca\"\"usal, and situational relationships within an event, and in terms of the characteristic transitions between different kinds of event\"\"s. Building on our initial work, we will accomplish the following Tasks: (1) Develop a computational model of event representation a\"\"nd episodic memory. (S. Gershman, Harvard), (2) Specify the neural mechanisms that support learning and application of semantic know\"\"ledge about events. (K. Norman, U. Hasson, Princeton), (3) Specify how corticohippocampal interactions support episodic memory retri\"\"eval and consolidation. (C. Ranganath, UC Davis), (4) Specify the cognitive and neural causes and consequences of event segmentation\"\" (J. Zacks, Washington University), & (5) Determine how broadband and oscillatory neural activity contributes to event segmentation\"\" and episodic memory (Orrin Devinsky, NYU, in collaboration with all team members).By addressing fundamental questions about how e\"\"vent segmentation shapes the structure of semantic and episodic memory, and how the hippocampus interacts with neocortical networks,\"\" the proposed empirical studies go well beyond the current state of the art. Moreover, by utilizing novel data-driven machine learni\"\"ng analysis approaches and theory-driven forward modeling of neuroimaging and electrocorticography data, every study in this project\"\" will break new methodological ground. At the end of the five-year period, we will deliver an integrated computational architecture\"\" that can translate in any direction between complex narrative or video stimuli, real-time brain activity patterns, and meaningful cless",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: We propose to investigate and demonstrate an innovative high-power, multi-spectral, non-mechanical steering subsystem ena\"bled by a combination of high-power MWIR and LWIR quantum cascade laser (QCL) and amplifier (QCA) arrays and a multi-spectral phase-array beam steering module on a single silicon platform. The proposed subsystem demonstrator (SSD) includes three spectral bands wit\"h tunable wavelengths: MWIR1 (e.g. 3.4-3.8 micron), MWIR2 (e.g. 4.5-4.6 micron), and LWIR (e.g. 9.0-10.6 micron). At the onset of th\"\"e project, specific wavelengths within each band can be selected by the Sponsor. The proposed SSD driven by the control electronics\"\" interfacing with the innovative active-matrix-array 3D photonic-electronic phase array (3D PEPA) allows the pointing, steering, and\"\" tracking of a remote object with all three wavelength bands with high beam quality M2 below 1.3, power (above 30 Watts of combined\"\" power), and stability. The high-resolution and high-precision 3D PEPA with integrated thin-film transistors (TFT) realized on CMOS-\"compatible fabrication processes allow sidelobe-free and hemispheric (180 degree total-field-of-view in all directions) beam steering by independent matrix control of pixels. The SSD realized on a single silicon platform with equal-path lengths allows agile tuning of the emission wavelengths of QCLs while supporting accurate and stable pointing under challenging ambient and vibration condition\"s. The proposed new capability addresses increased combat effectiveness for all aerial vehicles, manned and unmanned, by providing a\"\" conformal optical system required for search, track, dazzle, and jam. Additionally, this new technology addresses naval capability\"\" to control or to attack multi EW spectrum with rapid, accurate, and agile point-and-steer of multi EW spectrum laser beams. The pro\"posed project will develop very compact phased array optical beam steering technologies that will allow coherent energy spanning multiple bands of the MWIR and LWIR spectrum to be directed in a low divergence beam with minimal or no side lobes over an angular rang\"e coveringa complete hemisphere. The proposed phase array beam steering technology covers very fast (ms), small (28 cc), and emits\" high optical power levels (above 30 W total combined power). We will first test the prototyped SSD in the emulated lab environment at a collaborating laboratory with temperature variations and vibrations applied to the SSD. The laboratory prototype will be adapted into existing MWIR active sensing system used for surface and air antisubmarine warfare (ASW) applications. To minimize any di\"stortions to the launched beam due toatmospheric effects and ensure the desired underwater acoustic EA effects can be generated, th\"\"e prototype will be initially tested from a surface ship. Once the desired acoustic EA effects are demonstrated, the prototype will\" be incorporated into a flight-ruggedized package and field tested in realistic maritime environment on board a rotary wing platform. The warfighter payoffs the proposed project includes (a) increased combat effectiveness for all manned or unmanned aerial vehi\"cles or surface ships by providing a conformal optical system required for EA (search, track, dazzle, and jam) in such applications\"\" as Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) or Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM), counter-ISR against MWIR/LWIR passive or active i\"maging; as well as in active (acoustic) sensing in air ASW applications; (b)enhances Naval capability to control or to attack multi\"-EW spectrum with rapid, accurate, and agile point-and-steer of multi-EW spectrum laser beams; (c) expands mission capabilities to s\"\"imultaneous access to multiple spectral bands, extends range and time over target, increases platform survivability, supports faster\"\" response to targets, reduces sensitivity to vibrations andtemperature variations.less",

        "abstract": "Many therapeutic proteins are glycoproteins which are proteins that have chains of sugars (i.e. glycans) attached to them at specific sites in a process known as glycosylation. The structure and distribution of glycans on pharmaceutical glycoproteins have a dramatic effect on their efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and stability. In this project, therapeutic glycoproteins that are known to act as protective bioscavengers against chemical and biological toxins are produced recombinantly in plant-based production systems. Plant cells, as higher eukaryotes, can glycosylate proteins and the initial steps are identical between humans and plants. In addition, they do not harbor or propagate mammalian pathogens. Furthermore, plants can be cultured in mass scales. They are ideal expression systems for the low-cost and large-scale production of glycoproteins that are important for counteracting weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical and biological agents. The goals of this project are to develop novel methods for the production of two bioscavenger glycoproteins, human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), a bioscavenger for organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents, and a chimeric anthrax antitoxin (CGM2-Fc), with improved efficacy against their binding targets by altering the glycan structures that are attached to the proteins. BuChE is produced in transgenic rice cell culture bioreactors and CGM2-Fc is produced transiently in tobacco plants in an indoor facility. Following production and purification of the bioscavengers, advanced analytical tools (liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry) are used to determine precise glycan structures at each site. In vitro enzymatic processes are then used to modify the glycan structures, while computer modeling using atomistic molecular dynamic simulations and coarse grain modeling approaches predicts the effects of glycan structures on glycoprotein structure and target binding energy and is used to direct the glycan modification studies. Finally, experimental studies are used to test the efficacy of the various therapeutic bioscavenger glycoforms (including target binding rate constants, dissociation rates, thermodynamic parameters of interaction, pharmacokinetics and challenge studies). Improved fundamental understanding of how the glycan structures impact binding efficiency for therapeutic bioscavengers will allow us to design protective bioscavengers with improved efficacy. This project will provide fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship of glycans on glycoprotein therapeutics, and supply technologies for large-scale production of glycoproteins in plants and in vitro enzymatic modification of glycans on glycoproteins. Improved therapeutics may be discovered and the approach is generalizable to other bioscavenger glycoproteins.less",

        "abstract": "How does the human brain enable us to flexibly adapt to novel situations, applying hard-won prior experience in ways that apply to new challenges? Current AI systems continue to fail at capturing this central feature of human intelligence. We propose to leverage our extensive understanding of the neural organization of the human brain to suggest novel solutions to thisperennial challenge, using a synergistic combination of biologically-based computational models and cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques, including intracranial recordings and fMRI. Our approach involves four central hypotheses: 1) The brain learns and processes structure separate from content , along separate neural pathways. This enables abstract structural representations tobe flexibly recombined with novel content, while transferring structural inferences and implications to these novel domains. 2) Predictive learning can learn an abstract structural forward model of how events unfold over time (i.e., a situation model ), providing a biologically plausible mechanism for how the neural mechanisms that enable flexible behavior are generated. 3) The ability to direct behavior toward desired outcomes and goals requires the ability to reversethis model and figure out the actions required to achieve those goals. The hippocampus can help solve this problem by encoding the overarching situation model that led to a given outcome, and then later recalling that situation model for use as a plan to guide behavior toward that outcome, when it is desired again. This suggests a novel type of strategic control over hippocampalencoding and recall, and a critical role for episodic memory in enabling flexible human behavior. 4) The prefrontal cortex can robustly maintain abstract plans to guide behavior, based on representations learned through longer-timescale predictive learning. Each of these hypotheses has existing empirical and computational support, but this project is the first to put all of these elements together in a way that can finally make significant progress toward understandingflexible goal-driven human behavior.less",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of memory have identified acortico-hippocampal network that is critical for remembering past events. Recent evidenceindicates that regions in this network generate rhythmic electrophysiological oscillations in thetheta band (4-8 Hz), and that theta oscillations may be related to cognitive states that promotesuccessful memory retrieval. The objective of this project is to use three empirically motivatedmethods to manipulate theta activity and determine effects on memory and on recruitment ofbrain networks measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI. Rhythmic sensorystimulation (Aim 1), transcranial alternating current stimulation (Aim 2), and reward motivation(Aim 3) will be used to manipulate theta activity during memory retrieval tasks. EEG studies willdetermine how theta enhancement affects the magnitude and timing of theta activity duringmemory retrieval, and fMRI studies will determine effects on recruitment of the corticohippocampalnetwork. We will also use advanced multivariate analysis techniques to decodehow information about past episodes is represented in neural activity patterns and test whethertheta enhancement sharpens these representations. This project will advance basic science bydirectly connecting neural oscillations, which are currently poorly understood, to specificcognitive processes and to activity in a cortico-hippocampal network that is thought to play acrucial role in episodic memory. Moreover, the proposed studies can lead to the development ofnovel biomarkers for memory function and dysfunction (e.g., to assess service-connectedcognitive impairment) and of systems for accelerating learning (e.g., in training situations) andrehabilitating memory (e.g., in injured soldiers). The work can also contribute to thedevelopment of memory-guided brain-computer interface technologies.less",

What is common in the behaviors spanning these immense scales is what one can call adaptive emergent intrinsic computation. These systems\u00d5 functioning relies on a kind of self-programming\u00d1spontaneously-generated ex- tended patterns of control and self-monitoring. Our goal is to experimentally demonstrate and theoretically predict this kind of emergent adaptive computation. Technical approach: We take a particularly novel approach that harnesses recent advances in nonlinear physics, nanoscale thermodynamics, genetic engineering, and high-performance computing. Recent remarkable progress in these arenas and our team\u00d5s deep expertise with them suggests that our attack on the challenge of adaptive emergent intrinsic computation is likely to succeed, where others have fallen short. To guide and ground theoretical developments we will use four unique experimental platforms, two natural and two engineered, coupled with large-scale simulations to quantitatively bridge between theory and experiment. Anticipated Outcomes: In light of recent foundational progress we anticipate the following results: (i) information principles of pattern formation in large-scale complex systems, (ii) design, prediction, and monitoring of a novel class of spatial, networked information engines; (iii) thermodynamics of adaptation that lays out the trade-offs between cognitive processing and energetics, and (iv) identifying and using the natural programmability of emergent patterns. Impact on DoD Capabilities: By implementing networks of information engines connected in various topologies we will explore the principles driving the emergence of system organizations that support computation and adaptation. Success will introduce radically new and functional platforms that exploit intelligent thermodynamically-embedded information processing in a way that can be programmed to generate emergent functioning in distributed complex systems. Such capabilities will impact many DoD applications from endowing materials with computationally advanced sense-response capabilities and directing the flow of energy and entropy to and from storage devices to porting such programmable patterns to information processing on radically smaller spatial and faster temporal scales and a first-principles understanding of adaptive behavior in autonomous systems.less",

        "abstract": "Standard ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC) manufacturing creates components with large differences in properties due to variability in microstructural 'critical flaw' distributions. Critical flaws can be any irregularity in a component, such as a secondary phase, inclusion, crack, pore etc. This is problematic when designing reproducible UHTC components for Mach 6 hypersonic applications. The goal of this project is to build probabilistic characterization of processing-structure-properties (PSP) parameters and link them at each stage of UHTC processing in a way that allows for uncertainty propagation. This methodology has not been performed in the past due to the complex interrelations of UHTC PSP parameters that need to be deconvoluted. Thus, multi-fidelity PSP database development and effective integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) combined with statistical modeling is key to minimize uncertainty during UHTC manufacturing. This approach will consist of three key integrated thrusts- Thrust I- Manufacturing and rapid materials characterization- to populate a multi-fidelity PSP database using a combination of lower-fidelity in-lab experiments and modeling along with higher-fidelity synchrotron 3-D microstructural characterization experiments. Thrust II- Uncertainty quantification- to develop a PSP-ICME database in tandem with multi-fidelity statistical modeling using a Bayesian neural network approach. Thrust III- Validation of the multi-fidelity model- to verify that the statistical model can reduce uncertainty in UHTC manufacturing in terms of properties and microstructural flaws. The densification of ZrB2 will be used as a model system for this methodology as it is a prime candidate for ceramic matrix materials in hypersonic-ready ceramic matrix composites (CMCs).less",

        "abstract": "Research problem: Our existing research has identified powerful predictive learning mechanisms that enable our biologically-based computational models to learn invariant object representations in a purely self-organizing manner, without requiring the massive sets of hand-labeled images that standard deep neural networks are critically dependent upon. These mechanisms are based directly upon the biology of the primate visual system, and make sense of a wide range of data at many different levels of analysis. However, our existing models were developed using simplified visual inputs, and we propose here to scale them up to handle large numbers of realistic 3D objects, ultimately with multiple objects at a time interacting with each other.Technical approach: Predictive learning requires movie-like animated scenes, where the model is constantly predicting what will happen next, and learning from the difference between what actually does happen and the prediction. According to our theory, this prediction-outcome learning cycle occurs every 100 msec (10 Hz, i.e, the alpha rhythm). Thus, massive amounts of predictive learning can occur every day, providing the constraints to shape powerful internal generative, predictive models of the world. We propose to render large numbers of systematically generated scenes involving 3D objects moving with realistic physics, to train our models on increasingly complex and realistic environments. Ultimately, our models should be able to learn from real movies and video footage, and apply their knowledge to the interpretation of real-world images and scenes, in a semantically rich and meaningful manner.Anticipated outcome and impacts: It is hard to overstate the potential impact that this project could have on DoD capabilities, by enabling multiple different mission critical technologies that all depend, as people do, on the ability to effectively extract physical semantics from visual scenes. For example, this could greatly facilitate automated processing of large volumes of imagery and monitoring data. Likewise, autonomous robotic systems, which currently depend to a large extent on human operators for their perceptual abilities, could benefit substantially. In addition, we anticipate learning much more about advanced visual processing in the brain.less",

Failure by some alliance members to contribute effort or resources that insure the organization\u00d5s survival and success forces other members to disproportionately contribute to the organization\u00d5s actions and operation. We offer a novel approach to the study of these issues that focuses on a combination of network analysis, agent-based models, and empirical analysis of the determinants, dynamics, and implications of burden sharing in security cooperation. We also widen the scope of security cooperation agreements beyond existing research by focusing on defense cooperation agreements (DCAs) and general security agreements (GSAs) that specify specific forms of security cooperation among military establishment and civilian security agencies. Our project offers several innovations, specifically: \u00a5 Development of dynamic agent-based network models of security cooperation and burden sharing, which re-define the costs and benefits of security cooperation in ways that take into account direct and indirect network-related effects. \u00a5 Extending models of the determinants of burden sharing by incorporating a wide array of defense cooperation agreements, or DCAs and general security agreements (GSAs). \u00a5 Focus on implications of burden sharing.

' The objective of this proposal is to rethink and rearchitect the memory subsystem in future processors for high performance irregular workloads by taking advantage of 2.5D/3D electronic-photonic integration and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based silicon photonics. More specifically, the goal is to flatten the memory hierarchy as far as possible by eliminating cache hieprchy to realize a memory system that exhibits low and predictable latency. This is, achieved through a new DRAM !)1icroarchitecture with embedded WDM-based photonic interconnects with all-to-all interconnection capability that is codesigned carefully with the processor and the memory controller. The key facet of the new DRAM microatchitecture is a significantly higher number of active mini-banks with integrated . ' ' WDM silicon photonics that provide much higher concurrency and as a result a significant reducing in queueing delays at the memory controller. Detl;liled models for the DRAM and the memory controllers will be developed and integrated with RISC-V based processor and optical interconnection network models, in the \u00e1 gem5 simulation environment to \u00e1conduct a rigorous design space \u00e1study of the architectural parameters to evaluate the , perfonnance, scalability, and energy efficiency of the memory subsystem. Large scale graph data analytics, machine learning, and scientific computing kernels will be used as bench~,arks and the results will be compared with state-of.:the-art computing nodes from research and academia. ' An important deliverable of the project is a quantitative understanding of l_atency and energy per bit requirements of future DRAMs so that cache hierarchy can be eliminated for the benchmarks in consideration. This can have a broad impact on the design of.future DRAMs and processor architectures. Historically algorithms have evolved to take advantage of or overcome the limitations, ~fa traditional memory hierarchy, so- with a flatter memory hierarchy the proposed project can have an impact on how future algorithms are designed. Finally,,a flatter memory hierarchy is easier to program, so it can have a huge impact on productivity of applications developers in the future. '1 \u00e1 \u00a5 .

        "abstract": "What thermodynamic effort do open nonlinear systems expend as they spontaneously form complex patterns? Do highly complex organizations require more energy dissipation than simple ones? Or, are macroscopic patterns relatively neutral in terms of total system energy? Are increased fluctuations in entropy production a thermodynamic harbinger of pattern emergence? The answers, surprisingly unavailable at the present, late stage of statistical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics, appears to require a novel synthesis. This project brings together exciting results from three active research areas to address these questions. The first---information thermodynamics---connected recent advances in nonequilbrium thermodynamics with information theory to provide a cutting-edge understanding of Maxwell's Demon. It answers questions such as \" Can a Demon extract energy from a thermal bath utilizing control information? How can information be a fuel?\" Having come to fruition in the last two decades or so, the second---pattern formation theory---describes the mechanisms that drive spatially-extended systems to spontaneously organize into patterns of activity. It provides techniques that predict how a system dynamically amplifies inherent instability to macroscopic scales, eventually stabilizing emergent patterns via nonlinear attenuation. The third---meromorphic functional calculus--- provides the key new mathematical methods required to analyze the infinite-dimensional hidden linear dynamic of complex spatial patterns and temporal behaviors---patterns and behaviors implicated in both information thermodynamics and pattern formation. Success in the proposed synthesis will impact both our fundamental physical understanding of the energetics guiding far-from-equilibrium pattern formation and our ability to engineer and control emergent patterns that support functional behaviors, such as information processing, computation, and energy conversion. The abiding puzzle is how these systems balance constraint and fluctuation in the service of their functionality. All physical, chemical, and biological systems and all designed technologies are subject to thermodynamic constraints---energy conservation, entropy increase during macroscopic manipulations, and the like . This is especially true and challenging for those whose functioning relies on information processing embodied in emergent patterns. Nanoscale technology most aptly illustrates these fundamental limits. At these scales, we encounter finite-size induced fluctuations that can compromise a device's operation. Even technologies that do not yet depend on quantum effects have rapidly approached limits imposed by microscopic fluctuations. Similar conclusions hold for chemical and biomolecular processes. For example, motor proteins carry-out essential biological functions, such as intracellular nutrient transport, all the while bathed in fluctuations whose energetics fall at the same scale as the ATP-driven motion itself . On the one hand, the increasing demand for computation, combined with the nee d for new computational architectures and substrates, and our increasing ability to control and even design biological processes, on the other, make the proposed synthesis particularly relevant and timely. Understanding the functioning of this wide range of systems turns on developing a new theory of functional pattern formation in thermo-dynamical systems---systems that, at one and the same time, are dynamical systems (behaving and processing and storing information) and are large-scale physical systems (consisting of energetic microscopic subsystems). Our expertise in the above three research areas will bring unique perspectives and insights to this challenge, increasing the likelihood of success.less",
