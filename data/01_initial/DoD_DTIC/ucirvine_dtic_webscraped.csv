0,Wartime Organophosphate Exposure. Adenosine-based countermeasures to protect the CNS,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Janet Baulch,"There have been numerous incidences of organophosphate (OP) nerve agents such as sarin (GB) being used as weapons, representing a significant threat to warfighters and civilians. Immediate effects of exposure can include seizures, respiratory distress and death (1). Beyond those first minutes, or following lower dose exposures, there is increased risk for brain injury that may progressively worsen for months post-exposure without resolution. (1). Collectively these CNS outcomes of OP exposure impact the long-term quality of life (QOL) for victims and could represent an immense burden on the VA health care system. Our recent DTRA-funded rodent studies suggest that adenosine augmentation effectively mitigates cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation elicited following irradiation, outcomes similar to those observed following OP exposure (preliminary data and 2,3). Our project, responsive to Thrust Area 7-Fundamental Science for Chemical and Biological Defense, develops a novel adenosine-based, neuroprotective countermeasure to combat adverse CNS outcomes following GB exposure. Our lead compound ABT-702, an adenosine kinase (ADK) inhibitor, is an orally available, potent, well-tolerated drug that can be stockpiled for emergencies. The principles by which this compound acts are approved by the FDA or are in phase I clinical trials for other applications (4). Our milestones will establish the impact of acute GB exposure on the CNS and the efficacy of ABT-702 to protect against or mitigate the adverse effects of OP exposure.less","14,031,010",2022,2027

0,Sequential release of influenza hemagglutinin variants using liposomes and polymers with programmable release kinetics.,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to David Davies,"Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures to save lives, and has been responsible for the complete, or near complete, eradication of several infectious diseases. Conventional vaccine approaches are less effective for providing protection against multiple variant antigens (Ags), particularly when administered in a single dose. In this multidisciplinary application, that combines immunologists, chemists, pharmaceutical and biochemical engineers, we propose to develop a single-shot formulation platform, using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) variants (H1, H5, H7) as a model Ag, followed by filovirus glycoprotein (GP) variant Ags from Marburg and Ebola (species Zaire and Sudan) viruses. Each variant will be delivered in a different delivery vehicle designed for non-synchronous Ag-release in vivo. These vehicles will comprise lipid-based nanoparticles, protein-based nanoparticles, and microspheres, and modified with toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8-agonist for increased adjuvanticity. Antibody (Ab) crossreactivity will be evaluated on HA and GP variant protein microarrays, and affinity maturation confirmed by affinity measurements in sera, and by Ab V-gene sequencing. Cross-reactivity of anti-HA antibodies will also be evaluated in vivo for protection against challenge with heterologous influenza strains. This platform (Fig. 1), we call Affinity Maturation of Antibody by Non-synchronous Delivery of Antigen (AMANDA), can be applied to other variant pathogens of relevance to the warfighter.less","4,998,573",2018,2023
0,Chemically Programmable Virus-Like-Particles (cpVLP) for Single Dose Vaccination,Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to Philip Felgner,"Vaccines fail because they 1) lack the correct antigen and 2) they don’t induce a sufficient immune response. To address these gaps, our laboratory is in the 1st Option Period of a 3 year DTRA contract entitled “Using Whole Proteome Microarrays to Identify QFever Vaccine Antigen Candidates Associated with Protection. Project CBM-V-01” (HDTRA1-16-C-0009). We use a proteome microarray containing all 2000 proteins from the Q fever agent Coxiella burnetii to discover better vaccine antigens, and novel multi-TLR agonist conjugates to boost immune responses. This project uses a 2 dose, Prime & Boost immunization regimen. In response to the DTRA Topic G11 announcement “Critical Requirements for Effective Single Dose Vaccine”, we will construct and screen an assortment of nanoparticulate and biodegradable microsphere formulations with different physical properties that release antigen and TLR agonists at different rates. By mixing nanoparticles and biodegradable microspheres with different antigen release kinetics we aim to accomplish the Prime & Boost after a single injection. The nanoparticles are also designed to target antigen to the draining lymph node for improved vaccine efficacy. We will use diverse resources and personnel from our institution to accomplish the objectives of this new multidisciplinary proposal. Novel TLR agonists formulated in liposomes, nanoparticles and microspheres will be synthesized in the chemistry department. Vaccine formulations will be developed and characterized in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Chemistry Departments. Advanced immunoimaging resources in our Stem Cell Research Center will be used to determine bioavailability and track delivery of vaccine into the draining lymph node. Immunogenicity studies will be conducted in the Institute for Immunology and Flow Cytometry Facility. Our model vaccine antigen for this project is from Coxiella burnetii a biological weapon. We will utilize an in vivo mouse Immunogenicity Pipeline to evaluate the intensity and duration of the adaptive T- and B-cell mediated immune responses induced by these cpVLPs.

0,User-directed analysis and verification of modified binaries,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Mark Boddy,"In the Phase I and II efforts on Galois' Attack Sensitive Brittle Software (Brittle) SBIR project, we implemented Software Fault Enhancement (SFE), a binary modification technique for improving the robustness of existing binary code, without requiring access to source code or other documentation.  This work is promising enough that the toolset is now being commercialized.  On this sequential Phase II project, we will extend and integrate recent work on symbolic, concrete, and timed trace analysis to implement new means of providing assurance to the user that binary modifications made for SFE do not result in additional, unwanted changes in behavior.  This specifically includes changes in timed behavior, important in the operation of embedded systems such as digital control systems. The results of this project will be useful for providing such assurance for a range of applications of localized binary modification.  In addition to SFE, these include patching bugs or removing possible execution paths (e.g., removing application features), or instrumenting binaries to gather run-time information for further testing and analysis.  In all of these cases, potential end-users need assurance that the modified binaries will behave as before, except in circumscribed ways related to the goal of the modification as above.less","1,799,837",2023,2025
0,Robust Sandboxing and Lifting of ELF Binaries,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Stephen Crane,"Software and hardware flaws can be exploited to make programs perform unintended computations or leak sensitive data. We propose to counter these threats by isolating libraries and other program units inside a single process. Software developers will control how the code and data of an application gets mapped to compartments and declare how applications are intended to interact with one another. We will use virtual memory management features of modern x86 processors to make switches between compartments faster than context switches between processes while providing comparable isolation and security properties. Since not all applications can be built from sources, we will also investigate lifting of legacy binaries. This will involve design of suitable intermediate representations which can represent high-level semantics recovered via binary analysis and verified via formal methods. Finally, we will use the proposed lifting capability to investigate compartmentalization of legacy binaries.less","1,799,333",2023,2025
0,HONEY-MON: Combining Survivability with Cyber Deception,United States Department of the Navy,to MICHAEL FRANZ,"We propose a next-generation survivable system architecture that integrates redundant execution approaches from the domain of dependable systems with moving target defense techniques and cyber deception concepts from the domain of cyber security. As an added bonus, our approach provides novel defenses against exploits that target hardware flaws, including microarchitectural side channels. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of the first three that we are proposing here is an entirely novel approach that hasn't been tried before, and the fourth characteristic makes it even more compelling.In the proposed architecture, every server is a true moving-target NVX system and is simultaneously also a honeypot. Our main idea is that instead of terminating execution when a variant in a multi-variant execution is compromised by an attacker, the compromised variant is instead peeled off the joint computation and turned into a dynamic honeypot instance instead, while the surviving variants re-constitute and continue operating.Moreover, our approach significantly increases the mutual dissimilarity of the simultaneously executing variants by allowing the different versions to run on heterogeneous hardware; specifically, on both x86 and ARM at the same time. In order to totally subvert such a system, an attacker would need to craft an attack that simultaneously compromises both an ARM-based and an x86-based system using the identical inputs, and potentially do this while both the x86-based and the ARM-based variants themselves are constantly mutating as a moving-target defense. It is also highly unlikely that a hardware flaw such as a microarchitectural side channel would manifest itself in the same manner across two completely different processor architectures, so that an NVX system executing across different ISAs provides a natural defense against attacks that rely on such side channels. For example, it is outright impossible to mount a Rowhammer attack on memory cells that are not co-located on the same machine. If successful, our approach will set the bar to attackers significantly higher than all existing defense techniques that we are aware of, either implemented or proposed.The most important advantage of our proposed approach is that it doesn't require a human specialer to obtain the desired resilience gains. While existing approaches to retrofitting security onto legacy software, including current approaches of introducing heterogeneity, have been quite effective, they typically require substantial source code understanding and manual source code adaptation. Theproposed solution requires source code, but operates on such source code automatically.Our plan is to perform the research and build the infrastructure so that such cyberdeceptive NVX systems can be generated automatically from the source code of an ordinary server application. As part of our research plan, we propose to build a fully functioning prototype of the proposed system at scale. That system will take an existing server application, such as the Nginx web server, and then automatically instantiate it into a cyber-deceptive NVX system. Ourresearch will also conduct a comprehensive and objective evaluation of our approach and produce clear and concise metrics of its performance. Lastly, all software developed under this project will be released as open source.If successful, our project will go a long way towards increasing the survivability of networked systems, while simultaneously shifting the economies of cyber warfare in favor of defenders by raising the cost of an attack for the adversary.Approved for Public Releaseless","1,654,816",2021,2024
0,IA^2: Intent-Capturing Annotations for Isolation and Assurance,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Per Larsen,"Systems software can be tricked into performing unintended computation by feeding it carefully crafted inputs that corrupt and leak internal state. Modern software is so complex that implementation defects, some of which are exploitable, will only be discovered in the field. Operating systems isolate the state of each process such that a program experiencing an error does not bring down the entire system. There is no separation between libraries inside a single process, however. This has become a problem as applications grow more complex and defects in unrelated components can be combined freely into a weird machine performing unintended, malicious computations. As a result, several large applications have switched to a multi-process design. The idea is to reduce the “blast radius” of malicious inputs by i) processing untrusted inputs in a sandboxed process with few privileges and ii) performing privileged operations in a separate, higher privileged process. The application of multi-process designs is unfortunately limited by the substantial additional developer effort required to re-architect large and complex code bases such that costly inter-process interactions and marshaling of data does not lead to unacceptable slow downs. We propose an easy-to-use and efficient compartmentalization scheme that leverages a new memory management feature in x86 processors. The approach is easy to use because it does not require developers to split their application into multiple processes. Instead, programmers will use annotations to map libraries and executables to a set of compartments. When the application is built, we will automatically insert call gates on call edges that cross compartments thus reducing the programmer burden. Call gates implement compartment switches without assistance from the kernel and are therefore more efficient than full context switches from one process to another. Programmers are required to declare their intent to share certain data between compartments; this again requires less effort than marshaling data between processes. The compartmentalization substrate allocates data based on whether it is shared between compartments or private to a single compartment. We will provide tools that help programmers insert the necessary sharing annotations and diagnose segmentation faults triggered by accesses to the private memory of another compartment.   The proposed work builds on the encouraging results obtained during the Phase I effort. The experimental design of Phase I relied on a customized Rust compiler to compartmentalize applications. A major goal of Phase II is the ability to compartmentalize applications without the need to use a custom compartment-aware compiler to facilitate deployability. Other key improvements include the ability to support more compartmentalization models and deployments scenarios.less","1,498,543",2021,2024

0,Optimal Design and Additive Manufacturing of Functionally Graded Shell-Based PH Steel Metamaterials,United States Department of the Navy,to LORENZO VALDEVIT,"We propose to develop the scientific understanding that will enable optimal design and scalable additive manufacturing of a novel c) from 17-4 PH steel. We will deliver (i) a computational strategy for optimal design of LPBF-fabricated functionally graded shell-metamaterials that are far superior to traditional truss-based lattices, and (ii) a fabrication approach that allows local control of plastic deformation mechanisms in 17-4 PH steel thin-wall structures. While LPBF is an ideal technique for fabrication of lattice materials for critical structural applications, we argue that existing lattice designs have not taken advantage of two unique benefitsof this additive manufacturing process: (i) the ability to fabricate almost arbitrarily complextopologies and (ii) the opportunity to locally tailor the mechanical properties of the constituent material. The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to develop the scientific understanding in metallurgy, mechanics and topology optimization that is required to realize these advances and develop physically heterogeneous shell-metamaterials with unprecedented combinations of properties. Building upon exceptional results recently demonstrated by the PI on the mechanical efficiency of shell and plate-based metamaterials, we propose to: (1) fully elucidate the interplays among processing parameters, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties in LPBF-processedshell-metamaterials using a combination of numerical and experimental techniques, and establish effective processing windows; (2) harness these complex interplays to locally control martensite/austenite ratio and precipitate formation to either eliminate or amplify property gradients across the build; (3) combine mechanical models with experiments to achieve a full mechanistic understanding of the non-linear deformation and failure behavior of these shell-based metamaterials; (4) capitalize on the extensive (experimentally driven) database to infer, through the application of data analytics, property uncertainty and gradation models as well as their as sociated length scales and (5) develop novel non-linear stochastic topology optimization algorithms that benefit from fully validated models of the mechanics to id LPBF process. To demonstrate the power of this novel design/fabrication approach for DoD-relevant applications,r we will develop shell-metamaterials with optimal specific energy absorption under large plastic deformation, by ensuring simultaneous progression of plasticity throughout the material. Importantly, this cannot be achieved by traditional optimization of the metamaterial architecture, but requires local tuning of the yield strength and the strain hardening behavior of the material. By assembling a highly interdisciplinary team across three universities, with expertise in metallurgy, processing science, additive manufacturing, mechanical behavior of metamaterials,stochastic modeling and topology optimization, we will guarantee that the impact of this project extend well beyond the field of mechanical metamaterials. Elucidating the science underlying local microstructural control in PH steels fabricated by LPBF will dramatically affect the additive manufacturing of structural and functional materials for nearly any DoD application; at the sametime, establishing novel computational design processes, where the marriage between geometrical complexity (e.g. 3D shell-based topologies) and local property control provides a significantly wider design space, is expected to leapfrog the field of additively manufactured metamaterials in a variety of DoD applications.less","1,266,328",2021,2024
0,Hippocampal Networks and Episodic Memory,United States Department of the Navy,to GARY LYNCH,"People routinely organize the flow of events into distinct episodes when dealing with the complexity of dynamic environments. Such episodic memories incorporate information about the identity of items, their spatial locations, and the order in which they occurred(#what#, #where#, and #when#). Understanding how the cortical telencephalon processes episodes is thus a basic issue in contemporary neuroscience and one that is central to the development of autonomous systems that can deal with the real world. The hippocampus is critical for acquisition and retrieval of episodic memories but there are no models relating the components and operations of the structure to the multiple and diverse aspects of this singularly rich form of encoding. This in large part reflects a surprising absence of information about input/output relationships of the primary hippocampal circuit. However, studies in this program showed that signals from entorhinal cortex generate a two-part response in the output stage of hippocampus (field CA1) that is triggered by dual sub-circuits. Signals are routed through the two pathways according to the frequency of the arriving cortical pulses. Our studieshave also identified novel filters and amplifiers throughout the complex circuit along with a potent excitatory feedback system that is critical to throughput. Finally, we were able to show that certain of these subsystems are essential to acquisition of the #what, #where#, and #when# elements of an episode. These results enabled the construction of realistic simulations to address specific issues but there are major issues that prevented the development of a model capable of generating the diverse aspects of episodic memory. The proposed work addresses these problems. The first goal is to describe circuit responses to input from the spatial subdivision of the entorhinal cortex alone, or in combination with the non-spatial subdivision (the latter has been used in our studies to date). Our second goal is to identify the cellular mechanisms that underlie the unusual low pass filter in the CA3 field: studies will test proposed roles for feedforward inhibition from somatostatin-positive interneurons. Other Aim 2 studies will determine if field CA2 acts as an intermediary filter between CA3 and CA1. The third set of studies will test the influence of modulatory inputs, with special emphasis on the cholinergic afferents, on frequency filtering, amplification and feedback within the hippocampal circuit. Studies addressing the second the third goals make use of powerful chemo- and opto- genetic approaches to selectively manipulate specific cell types and afferents. The activity patterns and rhythms typically present in hippocampus are known to produce learning-related change in synaptic strength and a realistic model will accordingly require information on changes in circuit function arising from such plasticity. Thus, the fourth goal is to test for activity-induced changes in synaptic function at specific nodes # thisstudy will constitute a first test for circuit level plasticity. The final goal is to build a model of primary hippocampal circuitfunctions. These studies, to be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Richard Granger (Dartmouth) will both integrate the disparate operations of the circuit into the model and be used to develop hypotheses about how these operations relate to the processing of episodic memory.

0,Spectrum Analyzer Using Spintronic Radar Arrays,United States Department of the Army,to Ilya Krivorotov,"Ultra-fast measurements of the frequency of a microwave transmission is a vital task for many military applications including interception and jamming of signals used in communications, radar detection and remote control of weapons. The rapid tracking of adversarial frequency-agile microwave signals allows one to swiftly identify threats, such as radar-guided anti-tank missiles, and undertake appropriate counter-measures in real time, thus substantially increasing the safety of ground vehicles, and assuring superiority of the US battlefield forces in the microwave domain. These vehicle-protection tasks demand ultra-fast (microsecond time scale) measurements of adversarial external microwave signal frequencies in order to neutralize threats in real time. These vital goal can be achieved using recent advances in spintronics technology, where electron spin is used for microwave signal detection instead of electron charge. This technology is ideal for a new type of nano-sized and radiation-hard devices for the ultra-fast detection of  low-power microwave signals. Three key advantages of this technology based on spin transfer torque and tunneling magnetoresistance effects in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) over existing semiconductor technology are: higher sensitivity, which enables detection of adversarial microwave signals over longer distances, and, thus, provides early threat warning higher speed allowing for tracking of frequency-agile signals at the microsecond time scale radiation hardness In the course of our current STTR Phase II Program under the contract # W56HZV-18-C-0026, we developed a spintronic frequency detector based on an array of six MTJs and working in the microwave frequency S band (2 – 4 GHz). The proposed Sequential Phase II STTR Research Program significantly advances the technology developed in Phase II of the Program via: the use of novel spintronic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that increase the detector frequency to the microwave X band (8 – 12 GHz) relevant to anti-radar applications implementation of software-defined advanced adversarial signal analysis via integration with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) We will also reduce the SWAP detector parameters down to 3”x3”x1” size, 0.3 kg weight and 100 mW power. We will implement an automatic FPGA-based capability to separate the adversarial frequency-agile signals from multiple innocuous and noise signals, based on the temporal dependence of these signals. This feature will enable operation of the detector under electromagnetic interference (EMI) in realistic battlefield and urban environments.

0,23-000003470 Deep Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale and Multi-Physics Systems,United States Department of the Navy,to Ramin Baghgar Bostanabad,"Modeling a wide range of physical processes relies on solving complex partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Example applications include predicting crack propagation in underwater vehicles or controlling dissipated heat in microprocessors that are cooled with turbulent flows. While significant advancements have been made in solving such PDEs, existing technologies are prohibitively expensive. The costs are especially high in the case of #stochastic# PDEs because a large number of simulations are required to characterize the effects of uncertainties on the solution. These high costs reduce engineers' efficiency in solving inverse problems, building digital twins, or designing systems that must perform robustly in uncertain environments.To reduce computational costs, this proposal develops deep learning (DL) models that rapidly solve stochastic PDE systems. Our DL models have three novel features that distinguish them from existing approaches which solve PDEs via DL: (1) they are#transferable# which means they can readily model different processes that share the same governing equations, (2) they are #scalable# and hence can solve PDEs on large domains while resolving small-scale details, and (3) they are #probabilistic by construction# which means they can efficiently learn from scarce data and provide probabilistic predictions without using expensive sampling-based techniques. Compared to traditional solvers such as the finite element method, these features will provide the capability to predict the solution of stochastic PDEs with at least 2 orders of magnitude speedups and less than 2% loss in accuracy. By embedding our deep neural networks (DNNs) in multiscale or multi-physicssimulations, the computational savings will be even more.Upon successful completion, our contributions will enable on-the-fly emulation of a wide range of stochastic PDE systems on arbitrary domains via #pre-trained# DNNs. Hence, we expect to eliminate long training times while increasing accuracy and scalability. Additionally, we will leverage our approach to answer fundamental questions in engineering applications on multi-scale modeling of metallic alloys and thermofluidic heat control.To achieve real-time and robust performance, we design geometry-aware learning algorithms and leverage the well-established mathematics of domain decomposition methods that uniquely exploit parallel computing on heterogeneous machines that have multiple GPUs and CPUs. Additionally, to emulate multi-physics processes under uncertainty, we train multiple DNNs to learn each physics and then couple their predictions to solve the underlying stochastic PDE system. We expect our contributions to provide a sustainable platform for studying PDE-governed engineeredsystems. Therefore, we will develop the tools that ensure timely adoption and rapid maintenance. We will also provide scaling guidelines to estimate the required computational power for reaching desired levels of accuracy.less","1,000,000",2023,2026

0,Mutualistic Interactions in Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems,United States Department of the Navy,to Magnus Egerstedt,"In multi-robot systems, having robots with different capabilities can be highly beneficial as it allows for the robot team to be abl,e to participate in a larger class of missions, as sensing, actuation, computation, or communication capabilities can be spread acro,ss different team-mates, thereby supporting the deployment of a potentially significantly larger number of distinct capabilities. Th,is proposal formalizes the idea that it should be possible to make the whole larger than the sum of its parts in multi-agent robotic,s. For that to happen, it is no longer enough to consider capabilities in isolation, but rather how they interact to form brand new,capabilities. In ecology, such types of arrangements are known as a mutualistic interactions, or mutualisms, involving the exchange,of resources or services between two different species. Each species involved in a mutualism receives a benefit from the interaction,, and what this proposal envisions is a new framework for harnessing and encoding the idea of mutualism in a multi-agent robotics se,tting in order to go beyond the standard approach to heterogeneity by having brand new capabilities arise when combining agents with, different individual capabilities.

In this study, we will directly manipulate the defects responsible for plasticity while also enabling defect-aware design and nanoscale phase templating of future advanced engineering alloys. A unique aspect is the intimate coupling of solid mechanics and materials synthesis, naturally engaging two topical areas which are typically distinct. Stress is the primary driving force behind the segregation and structural changes involved in linear complexion transformations, and developing an understanding of these transitions will enable predictions about the outcomes of future processing experiments. On the other hand, real alloys containing different types and populations of linear complexions must be made in order to probe the fundamental mechanics of and barriers to dislocation mechanisms such as stacking fault constriction, dislocation breakaway, and secondary stress field interactions between the complexion and other defects. As a whole, this project will provide advancements in the fields of computational mechanics, in situ experimental mechanics utilizing novel electron microscopy techniques, defect engineering and design, and processing science.

Ettenberg,"Princeton Infrared Technologies, Inc. (PIRT) will team with University of California Irvine (UCI) to develop a room temperature imaging system with detectivity from 3 to 12 μm spanning mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and longwave infrared (LWIR) spectral ranges using non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) for standoff imaging spectroscopy and ranging.  This novel detection strategy captures MWIR/LWIR images at high pixel densities, high sensitivity, and low noise without cooling.  Currently, MWIR and LWIR imaging requires expensive low-bandgap semi-conducting materials, such as HgCdTe and InSb.  Cooled cameras that are commonly used to cover the entire 3 to 12 μm spectrum have low pixel densities such as 128x128, precluding the use of high-definition (HD) sampling for acquiring high quality videos in use for applications such as microscopy and hyperspectral imaging.  In this program, the team will deliver a 1280x1024 resolution camera using a custom InxAl1 x yGayAs array integrated with optics and high speed lasers that operate at room temperature to image light from 3 to 12 μm at video rates suitable for hyperspectral imaging of hot objects without the challenge of imaging through emissions.

Menon,"New internal actuation technologies and integrated design of guidance-control systems for kinetic kill vehicles are proposed. These actuation technologies can be used for KKV trajectory and attitude control in any speed range, both within and outside the atmosphere. Since the actuators are contained entirely within the airframe geometric envelope, and because no mass expulsion is involved, they offer several advantages over conventional aerodynamic control surfaces and reaction control systems. Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of using three new internal actuation systems for KKV trajectory and attitude control. Target interception within and outside the atmosphere, and engagements containing both endo- and exo-atmospheric trajectory segments were demonstrated. Flight control system robustness was investigated in Monte-Carlo simulations. Optimality of the trajectories was assessed using numerical trajectory optimization methods.

0,Carbon Nanotube FET Modeling and RF circuits,United States Department of the Air Force,to Dawei Wang,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential for high performance RF applications. Theoretical study has shown that the electrical current in a CNT field effect transistor (CFET) is intrinsically linear. Today, linearity is the underlying limitation in increasing the data transport densities of wireless networks. The complex modulation protocols used to achieve higher data rates requires linear amplifiers. Increasing linearity in current bulk semiconductors is done by driving higher currents through large transistor channels and limiting the RF operating region to the most linear portion of the depletion curve. This wastes power and generates heat. The intrinsic linearity of CNTs promises significant improvements in spectral efficiency without sacrificing power. To optimize CFET performance for linearity and build circuits around it, a compact model of a CFET transistor has been developed. This Phase II work focuses on fabricating devices with varying layout design which can be used for further compact model parameter extraction, and in turn, using the subsequent modeling result to guide device design and enable circuit design, thus achieving improvement in both device and circuit performance.

0,"Acoustic Design, Modeling, and Initial Flight Test Validation for Ultra-Low Noise Distributed Electric Propulsion Aircraft",United States Department of the Air Force,to Jacqueline Huynh,"During the Phase I effort, an analysis framework was developed to assess the noise of distributed-propulsion blown flap STOL vehicles which utilizes a noise-component based modeling approach to estimate the relevant noise sources based on flight performance requirements. In this framework, noise modeling of vehicles with multiple propellers or rotors uses discrete tonal and broadband noise modeling methods from ANOPP2's Blade Element Acoustic Tool (ABEAT). Multiple rotor interactions noise can be performed analytically in ANOPP using superposition to combine the tone signatures from individual propeller/rotor noise time histories. The propeller wake will also interact with the wing trailing edge and the flaps. This effect has been shown in previous noise measurements of blown lift-flap interaction noise to scale with approximately the 6th power of the jet velocity. Additional propulsor-airframe interaction effects are estimated through modified usage of the airframe noise modules. Additional noise at the flap and wing trailing edge is assumed to be impacted due to the increased local flow velocity from the propeller wake compared to aircraft without distributed blown lift. To include this effect, the propeller wake-flap and propeller wake-trailing edge interaction noise is approximated using ANOPP’s built-in Guo flap side edge noise and Fink trailing edge noise models, incorporating the estimated propeller wake velocity in different operations. This effect will be studied in further detail during the Phase II activity. To demonstrate the current functionality of the noise analysis method, example modeled sound exposure level (SEL) noise contours obtained from the developed noise modeling methods for observers at the ground level for the propeller, airframe, and total noise components during a representative continuous descent, blown-flap approach operation. The propeller noise dominates, but the airframe noise, mostly from the propeller wake-flap interaction noise, extends the 70 dB level of the total noise. Similar analysis was performed for a representative departure procedure, which showed that airframe noise was small compared to propeller noise. This demonstrates the method's capability to assess community noise impacts of the STOL vehicle. Similar analysis will be performed for additional flight procedures. The resultant Phase II methods will be used to design components with lower source noise levels (such as propellers) as well as flight operations for both lower source noise levels and community noise exposure levels.less","749,622",2022,2023
0,Thunderlane Phase II,United States Department of the Air Force,to Rian Quinn,"The Thunderlane Phase II effort defines a new hypervisor model that dissolves the boundary between hypervisor and operating system, and leverages state-of-the-art software diversity techniques for increased resistance to exploitation. The most widely used operating systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows and Linux) use monolithic kernel architectures that execute most system software with full root-level privileges. In contrast, microkernel architectures, which disaggregate the kernel into lower-privileged segments, are known for their stability and resistance to exploitation. Unfortunately, microkernels are not widely used, and often do not receive the development attention necessary to support mission critical hardware / software. The Thunderlane effort aims to solve these problems by leveraging hardware-based virtualization to define a new hybrid hypervisor / operating system architecture: the hyperkernel. Like a microkernel, each major component in the hyperkernel system executes in isolation, and communicates via well-defined channels that can be tested and verified. Unlike a microkernel, however, the hyperkernel can leverage existing software designed for monolithic kernels like Microsoft Windows and Linux providing both the reliability and security of a microkernel, with access to existing mission critical software.

0,Hippocampal Networks and Episodic Memory,United States Department of the Navy,to GARY LYNCH,"People routinely organize the flow of events into distinct episodes when dealing with the immense complexity of dynamic real environ ments. Individual episodic memories incorporate information about the identity of items, their spatial locations, and the order in w hich they occurred (what, where, and when). They also include records of actions taken during the episode and the context or s ituation in which the events happened. In all, the brains episodic memory system is a powerful tool for the orderly encoding and su bsequent retrieval of an extraordinary amount of information. It is also critical for planning future actions and for diverse cognit ive operations including inferential thinking. Understanding how the cortical telencephalon processes episodes is thus a basic issue in contemporary neuroscience and one that is central to the development of brain-based artificial intelligence. Experiments using h umans and animals indicate that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation and recall of episodes. The studies also iden tified pathways that carry what and when information to the structure, and our recent work led to discovery of a unique hippocam pal subsystem that adds the temporal element. Still missing is a description of network level operations (signal transformations) th at occur in the three basic subdivisions of hippocampus; the absence of such data prevents the construction of realistic simulations and derivation of related computational operations. The first goal of the proposed work is to describe how input signals arriving a t behaviorally relevant frequencies are transformed across polysynaptic hippocampal circuits. Preliminary experiments suggest that n odes in the circuit perform different types of functions (e.g., frequency filtering, on-off switching) and describe novel roles for sparse inputs arriving from lower brain areas. The results from this project will greatly increase the realism and range of our ext ant hippocampal models.Hippocampal output feeds into the subicular-entorhinal complex. Together, the complex and hippocampus form a giant loop that begins and ends in entorhinal cortex, a structure that has extensive two-way connections with association areas of neocortex. Preliminary work led to the surprising conclusion that the subicular nodes massively amplify signals arriving from hippo campus. The second goal is to complete a first network level physiological analysis of the subicular-entorhinal complex and the mann er in which it processes hippocampal output. Completion of this project will enable simulations of the loop and open the way to link age with models of posterior cortex under construction by our collaborators. The third goal is to build relatively simple, anatomica lly based models of prefrontal cortex and then to interconnect these with the hippocampal loop-posterior cortex system. Preliminary studies showed that a model of this type acquires a fundamental form of prefrontal learning (reversal learning) with performance th at compares favorably with a popular version of machine learning.

0,Detached-eddy Simulation with Turbulent Combustion in the Turbine Stage for Enhanced Performance,United States Department of the Navy,to WILLIAM SIRIGNANO,"The turbine burner for turbo-fan and turbojet engines offers an exciting opportunity for improved efficiency and greater power for either thrust or auxiliary purposes. Our well cited papers [1, 2] show the thermodynamic foundations for obtaining significantly improved performance by burning additional fuel with the products of fuel-lean primary combustor. Heat release in the expanding flow through the turbine adds to the power and efficiency level while still maintaining the limitations on material temperature. It can be more efficient than traditional afterburners because the combustion occurred at higher pressure. Secondly, by burning in the turbine, the power is available for either augmented thrust or auxiliary functions. For turbojets that might be used for some unmanned aircraft, a single auxiliary turbine-burner may achieve 10-30% specific thrust (ST) increase for flight Mach number range of 0 to 2 while keeping specific fuel consumption (SFC) almost identical for subsonic flight and a slight increase for supersonic flight all without the added weight and hefty SFC of an afterburner. Even greater percentage gains in ST and SFC are achievable by the turbine-burner configurations when used in the turbofan engine for manned or unmanned aircraft. We are ready to make a large leap forward in our analysis and understanding of the potential for turbine burners. Computational capabilities now allow us to consider burning through both the stator and rotor. Better computational analysis of the turbulent combustion and accelerating transonic flow is now possible through large-eddy simulation (LES). [6-10] Improved sub-grid flamelet modelling is now available. [7-10] The capability for considering both liquid-phase and gas-phase behaviors in coupled fashion exists. The research will focus on computational analysis of the flow through a turbine stage, both stator and rotor, with the special feature of fuel injection into the accelerating hot mixture of air and combustion products from the primary upstream burner. The goals are to provide relevant details and patterns concerning the turbulent mixing and combustion of the reactants, how it affects turbine power output, how it affects heat transfer to the turbine blades, and how it affects the mixture that flows to the next stage or to a nozzle. Thus, collectively from the information produced, an understanding of performance with the new concept will be determined. In parallel to the above investigation into the fundamental flow and combustion physics for the advancement of the turbine-burner concept, we will also perform system analysis of the basic thermodynamics and fluid dynamic cycle of the turbine-burner engine.

0,Functionally Integrated Materials via Additive Manufacturing,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Julie Schoenung,"Integrated circuits have revolutionized our world through the creation of smaller and faster electronic devices, eliminating the need to assemble multiple discrete electronic components. With the advent of additive manufacturing (AM), especially directed energy deposition (DED) techniques, such as Laser Engineered Net-Shaping (LENS¨), it is now possible, in theory, to spatially control, in three dimensions, material composition and microstructure, and consequently functionality. This 3D functional design of structural components, defined in this research proposal as Functionally Integrated Materials (FIMs), is a novel, visionary concept, which will allow the creation of single-structure yet multi-functional products that avoid the need for machining, joining, assembly, coatings, and maybe even wire interconnects. In the ideal case, complex products such as armor with embedded sensors and energy systems could be created in-situ in one machine, requiring only microstructural or compositional variations on an extremely localized level. This revolutionary concept is currently constrained, however, by the lack of fundamental scientific and engineering level understanding of AM, especially when heterogeneities are introduced, which are essential when creating FIMs. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research program is to establish a fundamental scientific framework that will make it possible to design and engineer FIMs with tunable properties by tailoring microstructure and compositional heterogeneities using DED-based AM techniques. Specifically, we aim to design heterogeneities into the as-deposited structure, by creating gradients in grain size, composition and phase/precipitation, in order to manipulate mechanical behavior. For instance, a 3D AM-deposited FIM could be designed that would provide strength in select regions due to precipitates, toughness in others due to coarse grains, and enhanced wear resistance in others due to the presence of hard ceramic particles. But in AM, functionality, which is derived from material behavior, is controlled by microstructure and composition, which is furthermore controlled by deposition conditions and the complex interactions of thermal, mass and materials phenomena, especially in the molten pool. Thus, this research program will utilize a wide range of computational and experimental techniques to elucidate the fundamental processing-microstructure-property relationships that govern the development of FIMs. Our teamÕs unique combination of capabilities in metal AM, real-time in-situ diagnostics, computational simulation and modeling, materials characterization, and mechanical testing will allow us to successfully establish a fundamental understanding of the relationships between heterogeneous structures, as dictated by AM deposition and molten pool solidification conditions, and materials behavior and functionality, thereby setting the foundation to develop and implement FIMs. Our research goals will be accomplished through continuous and close collaborations amongst all participants working iteratively on modeling and experimentation.

Large amplitude, nonlinear intern,al waves (NLIWs) can induce strong currents, upwell dense water high in nutrients, and also affect marine operations and acoustic co,mmunications. The processes that determine generation and propagation of NLIWs have been the focus of extensive research. The bulk o,f work addressing NLIW transformation as they interact with topography, including shoaling and breaking, has largely focused on 2D t,opography. A number of remote sensing studies have noted significant redirection of NLIW energy associated with steep 3D topography,, however. The dynamics of NLIW refraction around steep topographic features is not yet well-understood. Here, we propose to explore, processes that determine NLIW transformation over steep, 3D topography - including refraction, shoaling and reflection along with, the implications of these processes on the internal wave environment at larger scales. The broad objective for the project is to im,prove forecasting and predictability for nonlinear internal waves in the ocean. The proposed work will make use of high resolution n,umerical simulations combined with analysis of existing observational data to examine the effects of wave characteristics, flow hist,ory, local internal tides and changes in rotation on NLIW transformation and on subsequent generation of residual circulation and tr,apped baroclinic energy.

Herein, by drawing inspiration from the natural highly-evolved architecture and dynamic color-changing functionality of blue-ringed H. lunulata octopus skin, we propose to address this grand challenge and to develop multifunctional camouflage and signaling systems that will not only controllably modulate their relative color brightnesses, fluorescence signal intensities, and infrared appearance contrasts with the surroundings but that will also possess an unprecedented combination of associated performance metrics and figures of merit.

0,Light sheet microscopy for 3-D description of networks in hippocampal output stages,United States Department of the Navy,to GARY LYNCH,"Light sheet microscopy, combined with tissue clearing methods, allows for extremely detailed 3-D imaging of large portions of the brain. This imaging method uses a thin sheet of light to excite a fluorescent marker in a focal region of tissue, thus allowing for relatively fast sampling speed and high optical resolution. Sampling though the entire extent of a brain region allows for very detailed 3-D imaging of labeled structures. The technique is readily used in conjunction with immunofluorescence methods for labeling axon projections from small populations of neurons. Combined these techniques make it possible to visualize the entirety of the connections between discrete brain subfields across very large distances. The power of the system becomes evident when considering interdigitated brain structures that rotate along three axes, a long-standing problem for more traditional neuroanatomical methods. We propose to use light sheet microscopy to address a critical roadblock for the development of a theory ofhippocampus. The hippocampus plays an essential role in the acquisition and recall of the episodic (narrative) memories used by people to organize the flow of everyday experience. These operations are critical for much of cognition including planning of future activities and inferential thinking. A recent study provided striking evidence that discrete damage to hippocampus entirely eliminates the ability of people to recall the order in which events had occurred during a ~20 walk across a university campus. These individuals had lesser problems remembering the identity of the events or their spatial locations. We then discovered a unique network within the rodent hippocampus that maintains traces of inputs for several minutes, a time period unparalleled for brain circuits. Treatments that block this self-sustained, reverberating activity eliminated the capacity of the animals to acquire temporal order for a sequence of cues without interfering with learning the identity and location of the cues. We have constructed realistic simulations that help elucidate the neuronal events that enable these network level functions [Cox et al, Nature, Comm Biology, 2019].The multiple stages of hippocampus form a giant loop with the multiple association regions of the neocortex. The latter, which are enormous in human brain, are generally held to perform the most complex types of processing to be found in cortex. They provide the primary input to hippocampus, the multiple stages of which then funnel into a set of output nodes that project back to the association regions. Based on results noted above, we propose that a primary function of this remarkable cortico-hippocampal-cortical loop is to add time and sequencing to the highest levels of cortical operations. The anatomy and physiology of the inputs to hippocampus and the first three nodes of the intra-hippocampal network have been described in great detail. Much less is known about the networks and functional organization of the three output stages. The proposed light sheet microscope will be used in conjunction with discrete tracer injections to develop a 3-D picture of the connections within and between the subdivisions of these missing stages. The emerging map of output stage circuitry will be used to guide physiological experiments and simulations. We believe that the project, though ambitious, will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of hippocampus and enable the construction of algorithms for brain based autonomous devices with the capability of dealing with dynamic real world situations.less","610,174",2021,2022

The fundamental novelty of this project is to design an end-to-end framework that systematically combines HDC with existing well-developed algorithms to significantly enhance efficiency, robustness, and learnability. Unlike prior research that looked at HDC mainly as a classifier, our framework, called DeepHD, expands HDC functionality to learning, cognitive, and computing.

DeepHD combines HDC learning capability to enhance the efficiency and robustnessof a wide range of algorithms.

We exploit this functionality to accelerate the back-bone algorithm using uniform HDC data types and primitives.

0,UCI Core Optical Laboratory Resource,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Bernard Choi,"Optical technologies provide minimally- and non-invasive in vivo functional imaging, multiscale diagnostics, image-guided therapy, and laser surgery from sub-cellular to organ spatial scales. Since its founding in 1986, the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic (BLIMC) has served as a premier interdisciplinary research institute for optics and photonics in biology and medicine. Research groups within BLIMC continuously develop new optical technologies and methodologies that are then applied solve biological and biomedical problems. Often, the latest technologies build upon the work of previous system designs, resulting in refined designs with tremendous capabilities but at the cost of increased complexity. Hence, the latest technologies in the laboratory are not conducive to the hands-on training of newer scientists and engineers. This mismatch leads to a widening gap in our general capabilities to educate our trainees in key foundational and applied concepts in optics and photonics. As a result, we propose addressing this gap by establishing a UCI Core Optical Laboratory Resource (COLR). With the COLR, we will train the next generation of scientists and engineers to develop skills in building basic and applied optical systems and observing, measuring, and interpreting fundamental optical phenomena. The DoD Research and Education Program for HBCUs/MIs is an ideal and timely mechanism to enhance our capabilities to attract and train the next generation of scientists and engineers in technologies relevant to DoD research areas of interest. The UCI COLR will have dedicated space and instrumentation to allow trainees to learn and explore core principles associated with multiple optics concepts and how specific optical imaging systems work. Hands-on training in optics and photonics is a significant bottleneck in the education of our students and researchers. To date, such training is available only in the laboratories of individual faculty members, which leads to inconsistent and lab-specific training on optical concepts. Instead, the CORL will enable a robust and broad education in fundamental optical principles. Acquisition of the specified instrumentation will augment our capabilities to pursue research in areas of interest to DoD. BLIMC has a long-standing research center funded by the AFOSR to develop advanced optical technologies for defense trauma and critical care. The equipment we propose purchasing for the resource is intentionally synchronized with the foundational optical measurements associated with these individual projects. Acquisition of the specified equipment/instrumentation will augment our ability to attract students to pursue studies leading to STEM careers. Trainees at UCI will benefit significantly from the equipment that comprises the proposed resource. Lab-based coursework in multiple departments will provide trainees with opportunities to develop optical system design and data acquisition skills. In addition, general optics/photonics courses and specialty courses in specific imaging approaches will be created that rely heavily on the UCI CORL instrumentation. Topics of interest include laser fundamentals, imaging system design, and understanding health disparities associated with optical measurements. We also will develop both formal and informal workshops and boot camps that can be offered during the summer. For example, our multi-year partnerships with HBCU and local minorityservice community college programs will allow for the training of ~30 summer students. During these visits, we will use the CORL to strengthen the hands-on training and engagement of the summer students in optics and photonics.

However, learning flow boiling pri,nciples has been a significant challenge as boiling involves complex interfacial phenomena between liquid and vapor phases, resultin,g in the formation of dynamic bubbles. Recent innovations in artificial intelligence have made it possible to incorporate machine le,arning models into research on flow boiling under a new paradigm. Above all, machine vision can demonstrate the precise and automati,c object prototyping of individual instances to extract physically meaningful features from dynamic bubbles, which has been nearly i,mpossible with conventional image processing methodologies. The graphical data collection from multiple inputs (i.e., conventional i,mages and neuromorphic event strings) will allow us to connect them with heat transfer performance and find hidden mechanisms that w,ould represent a game-changing innovation for thermofluidic engineering. Therefore, this projects overarching objective is to provi,de a holistic description of dynamic flow boiling physics and to push the knowledge boundaries of thermofluidic science. To achieve, this goal, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates experiments, neuromorphic imaging, machine vision, data processing, a,nd state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

0,Foundations of Deep Learning,United States Department of the Army,to PIERRE BALDI,"Neural networks and deep learning are everywhere, powering the current expansion of AI across all applications, from computer vision, to speech recognition, to self-driving cars, to search engines and natural language processing systems, to health care, and far beyond. Yet a comprehensive theory of deep learning is lacking. Basic questions about measuring the capabilities of a given neural architecture or measuring the information contained in a training set have remained open for many decades. We propose to take a significant step in addressing this fundamental technological gap by developing a precise, quantitative, theory of neural network capacity and generalization properties. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team led by one mathematician (Dr. Vershynin) and one computer scientist (Dr. Baldi) with a track-record of productive collaborations. As a team, we propose to develop a theory and conduct simulations around the fundamental concept of capacity that we have recently introduced. The capacity C(A) of a neural architecture A is defined to be the logarithm base two of the number (or volume) of different functions that can be implemented by A as its synaptic weights are varied. Most importantly, C(A) is the number of bits that must be ``communicated'' from the training set to the synaptic weights in order to select the proper function in A. Thus the notion of capacity acts as a hinge connecting data and neural architectures. In a series of recent papers, we have shown how capacity can be computed precisely for various neural architectures consisting of linear, or polynomial, threshold gates. In general, capacity is a cubic polynomial in the parameters of the architectures, such as the number of units per layer, where the bottleneck layers play a special role. Based on these and other preliminary results, we propose to extend the theory to other kinds of units and networks to cover most of the cases used in practice. We propose also to relate capacity to other notions of complexity and to use capacity to derive estimates and bounds on training and generalization errors. We also propose to use capacity to estimate the amount of effective information contained in training data relative to a task T by identifying and relating the size of the smallest training set that enables an architecture to perform T to the capacity of the smallest architecture that can perform T. These ideas will be investigated theoretically, by continuing to develop the mathematical theory of capacity, and also through systematic simulations conducted on synthetic data sets as well as standard benchmark datasets. In addition, the collaboration will be developed within a rich environment of real-life applications to problems in the natural sciences. Thus theoretical concepts and practical applications will be developed together and reciprocally feed on each other. Because deep learning is so widely used and is at the center of AI and its many applications, we believe that a new quantitatively theory of deep learning based on the notion of capacity could have important benefits, including providing additional guidelines for the design of neural architectures for a given task T, new ways of measuring the amount of effective information contained in the data relative to the task T, and predictive estimates of training and generalization error. As it has been said many times: ``Nothing is more practical than a good theory''. It could provide explanations for the unreasonable success of deep learning, guide future design and applications, and stimulate new ideas and progress in AI, machine learning, and computer science.less","499,999",2020,2023

0,Fundamental studies on the evolution of stress and other defects during additive manufacturing.,United States Department of the Army,to Enrique Lavernia,"In this research proposal, we put forward the hypothesis that there are still important unresolved specific technical challenges and scientific issues related to the evolution of stress and porosity during additive manufacturing (AM) processing that require systematic, fundamental research. This argument is made on the basis of our prior experience with AM, as well as on our review of current scientific literature. To that effect most current research focuses on minimizing surface roughness and geometrical inaccuracies, predicting microstructural evolution through unique thermal cycles, avoiding incorporation of un-molten particles and porosity, and ameliorating the effects of residual stress. These issues are influenced by a number of process parameters and variables, such as the laser power and powder feed rate, as well as the scan sequence and timing of laser passes, which can alter thermal transfer behavior. There are also some interesting and critical but more challenging problems related to the melt pool that require in-depth studies of a fundamental nature, including powder interactions with the laser beam and melt pool, convective and turbulent melt flow behavior, keyhole formation in the melt pool, rapid melting, potential vaporization, non-equilibrium solidification involving phase transformations, and possible chemical reactions between reactive elements. The scientific objectives of the proposed research are to provide fundamental insight into mechanisms that govern evolution of stress and porosity during laser directed energy deposition (DED). To accomplish these objectives, we describe a research proposal that involves carefully designed experiments, advanced diagnostics (microstructure and mechanical behavior) and modeling analysis in combination with binary materials systems with well-established thermodynamic and physical properties. The materials systems proposed herein were selected in order to facilitate interpretation and analysis of the results that will be generated. More specifically, the proposed research is oriented to establish the framework that is required to deploy fundamental studies on particleÐpool interactions and their effects on porosity and residual stresses in materials fabricated via DED.

0,Expanding the toolbox of DNA nanotechnology- silver-mediated DNA base pairing,United States Air Force,to STACY COPP,"DNA is a powerful tool for nanotechnology, with remarkable sequence-encoded properties that are unrivaled by manmade materials. However, because nanomaterials made of DNA building blocks can easily degrade in harsh environments, a new paradigm is critically needed to dramatically enhance the stability and functionality of DNA nanostructures while retaining their remarkable bio-enabled structure and dynamics. This proposal aims to address this urgent need by exploiting the unique interactions of DNA with silver. Silver atoms interact specifically with the nucleobases that make up the genetic code of DNA, and recent studies have found that silver can mediate formation of entire DNA duplexes, with each base pair bridged by a single silver cation. These silver-mediated duplexes form rigid 'nanowires' of silver atoms and exhibit base pairing rules that differ from the well-known Watson-Crick base pairing of natural DNA. We will use a combined experimental approach, harnessing high resolution mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, and electron microscopy to connect the atomic sizes of silver-mediated nanostructures with their structural properties. Then, we will connect these structural properties to physical properties, uncovering how DNA sequence programs mechanical rigidity and electrical transport in silver-mediated DNA duplexes. Finally, we will investigate the functionalities of silvermediated DNA nanostructures for structural DNA nanotechnology. This research effort will build a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the scientific principles governing silver-mediated DNA nanostructures and will enable predictive design of DNA nanotechnology schemes that exploit their remarkable properties.

In a series of seminal behavior experiments, Tolman demonstrated that rats have cognitive mapping characteristics, that is, they can deliberate, adapt to change, form hypotheses, and show imagination. It should be noted that these capabilities performed by rats most definitely outperform current man made systems. To better understand cognitive maps in rats and humans, and to build an artificial system with these capabilities, we propose a unique convergence of experimental and computational modeling techniques. Our approach will: (i) observe and manipulate circuits from multiple brain areas simultaneously, all during cognitive mapping experiments in the rodent; (ii) optimize large scale parameter spaces through machine learning and coevolutionary computation to match these neurophysiological responses and behavior in spiking neural networks; (iii) port the spiking neural networks onto embedded, non Von Neumann neuromorphic chips to demonstrate cognitive mapping on power efficient autonomous robots.

0,Microscale 3-D printing for nanoscale tunable ferromagnetic materials,United States Department of the Army,to Camilo Velez Cuervo,"Microscale 3-D printing for nanoscale tunable ferromagnetic materials Research Objective: Experimental study on how to tailor the macroscale magnetic, electric, and mechanical properties of magnetic nanocomposites by patterning and manipulating ferromagnetic shapes at the microscale, using 3D printing coupled with externally oriented magnetic fields. Determine how the anisotropic ferromagnetic inclusions affect the overall macroscale material properties. Validate that the nanostructured magnetic inclusions within the composite can be selectively aligned and magnetized at will by controlling the ferromagnetic material concentration, 3D printing patterns, and the external multi-axis magnetic field strength. Potential Impact and Significance: State-of-the-art magnetic devices are limited in performance and fabrication throughput due to the lack of control of magnetic nanostructures (the limiting factor for magnetic properties). The proposed work will develop new understandings on how to pre-align and selectively imprint magnetic poles within laser sintered magnetic nanocomposites, which has never been demonstrated before. This will bring new design capabilities and significantly reduce SWaP-C metrics for deployed systems. Examples of Army near term applications include soldier wearable power devices and magnetic actuators for soft robotics. The developed fabrication process can be directly used to construct miniaturized electro-permanent-magnets (EPMÕs) needed for DEVCOM ARLÕs through-metal acoustic wireless power transfer work (the EPMÕs used to enhance mechanical coupling), which is used for autonomous UAV recharging platforms and power/data transfer applications. With the PI also being a leader in the field of EPM miniaturization, this effort will enable our acoustic transfer technology to achieve 20 times higher power densities than traditional inductive power transfer technologies. Innovation: UC-Irvine has recently discovered a class of 3D-printed flexible and multimaterial magnetic nanocomposites (NdFeB, Fe,Fe3O4, SmCo, or BaFe12O19) with sub-millimeter resolution using digital light processing (DLP), which allow the tailoring of soft/hard magnetic properties such as saturation magnetization, permeability, remanence, ferromagnetic resonance (41-53 GHz wide range), frequency stability, and electrical conductivity/capacitance, achieved through adjusting nanoparticle concentration and inducing magnetic anisotropy during printing. This lays the groundwork to demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to selectively align/magnetize a magnetic nanocomposite during the manufacturing process. Using a similar selective printing process, the PI was also able to construct a highly miniaturized 3.8 mm3 volume EPM, with full electronics and remote-control capability, which is the smallest EPM ever demonstrated in literature (four orders of magnitude volume reduction compared to commercially available EPMÕs). The printing process also enabled the PI to utilize an optimized axisymmetric magnetic array design, which provides a higher controllable magnetic latching force within a smaller volume. Effort Description: In this 6.1 effort, we will study how to tailor individual magnetic properties without affecting the printing conditions and degrading the material mechanical stability. The impact of printing in the presence of external magnetic fields will also be studied. Major milestones include: (Year 1) Demonstrate printing of magnetic materials with tunable material properties using DLP with substantial increment on the magnetic concentration and selected ferromagnetic nanomaterials. (Year 2) Demonstrate integration of laser additive manufacturing and selective alignment/magnetization (using a constructed multi-axis magnetization head) for full control of magnetization and other material properties.less","440,000",2023,2025

0,Remote Attestation of Critical Infrastructure Components,National Security Agency,to Gene Tsudik,"he objective of the proposed multidisciplinary center ÒQuantum Materials by Design with Electromagnetic ExcitationÓ is to create new electronic states of matter that are unobtainable through conventional solid-state synthesis. We will utilize unique capabilities within our team that employ excitations across the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, including with extremely high pulsed fields, to design, realize, and manipulate new phases and responses in strongly correlated materials. The rich and complex energy landscape of these materials makes them uniquely responsive to EM excitation that alters microscopic interactions and even spatial dimensionality, thus offering the greatest potential for the design and discovery of new driven states. Specifically, we will focus on realizing new correlated states via the following approaches, many of which have never been previously considered: (1) EM stimulated, bond selective, tuning of charge hopping parameters, (2) direct EM modification of magnetic exchange, order, and frustration, (3) continuous EM control of dimensionality and hybridization, and (4) EM excitation across kinetic barriers to realize metastable states that are thermodynamically inaccessible. Our goal is rational design and realization of truly new phases inaccessible by other methods. Our advanced tools allow for comprehensive interrogation of these new states and their responses with the required time resolution through a diverse array of pulsed probes of EM induced electrical/magnetic symmetries, band structure, ac conductivity, ac magnetic susceptibility and charge transport. Materials synthesis will target highly perfect epitaxial thin films, bulk single crystals and van der Waals heterostructures that are finely tuned near phase boundaries to facilitate discovery of EM driven states. Theory will identify the best systems and strategies for EM manipulation, calculate how the driven states are unveiled in ultrafast probes, and, with continuous feedback from experiment, aim at a predictive framework. The approaches we develop will form a very general roadmap for EM design of materials.less","406,923",2016,2019
0,Secure Topological Interference Management for Tactical Wireless Networks,United States Department of the Army,to Syed Jafar,"The pursuit of information dominance demands that tactical wireless networks be designed to operate as close to optimal as possible in all regards, from their data rates and security guarantees to their robustness to channel uncertainty. It is therefore especially important to understand the fundamental limits (information theoretic capacity) of these networks. While exact capacity characterizations remain elusive, progress has been made in the understanding of capacity approximations through Degrees of Freedom studies. These studies however, suffer from the severe limitation that they treat all non-zero channels as essentially equally strong, thereby neglecting to exploit the diversity of signal strengths that is present in any wireless network, i.e., the topological aspect of a wireless network. Topological interference management, as used in this proposal, refers to ways to exploit the finite precision knowledge of channel strengths at the transmitters. This is accomplished with the help of the Generalized Degrees of Freedom metric that is sensitive to both arbitrary channel strength levels as well as channel uncertainty levels. It is against this background that the proposed research seeks to study secure topological interference management. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES The study of secure topological interference management is motivated by three concerns: 1) Security, 2) Robustness, and 3) Optimality. In particular, the proposed research seeks information theoretic security guarantees that do not break down even with computationally unbounded adversaries, robustness to channel uncertainty ensured by allowing only finite precision knowledge of channel strengths to the transmitters, and information theoretic proof of optimality in the Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) sense that leads to approximately optimal schemes at finite SNR subject to further localized optimization around the GDoF optimal scheme. METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED The research space is comprised of three dimensions --- 1) the choice of metric (GDoF region leading to finite SNR rate region), 2) the choice of topology (weak, strong, mixed, symmetric or asymmetric), and 3) the choice of network (interference, broadcast, multicast, MIMO/SISO, arbitrary numbers of eavesdroppers). Within this research space, achievable schemes will utilize recent advances in interference alignment, rate splitting, power control, optimal jammer design and ways to exploit common randomness across distributed transmitters. Proofs of optimality, or converse proofs, will rely on aligned images bounds, sum-set inequalities, and functional sub-modularity. SIGNIFICANCE TO ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE There is much prior work on secure communications, robust jamming schemes, and GDoF optimality, but very little that studies all three in conjunction. Typically optimal schemes for secure communications are studied with the assumption of perfect channel knowledge, robust jamming schemes are studied without any claim of information theoretic optimality, and GDoF studies with channel uncertainty ignore security concerns. Therefore, the secure topological interference management problem is virtually unexplored. One of the main hurdles to this work in the past has been the lack of effective information theoretic bounding techniques under channel uncertainty. Upper bounds are important not only to prove impossibility results, but also to discover key insights into the ideas needed to achieve those bounds. However, the recent advances in the Aligned Images bounds have broken this barrier, for the first time putting this rich research avenue within reach. The proposed research is aimed at exploring this exciting opportunity.less","397,289",2019,2022

0,"Probing the Surfaces of Atmospheric Organic Particles and the Implications for Climate Change, Air Quality, Visibility and Bioavailability",United States Department of the Army,to Barbara Finlayson-Pitts,"Atmospheric reactions are intimately involved with climate change, and in addition, they lead to changes in toxicity and bioavailability of species emitted into the air. For example, airborne toxics to which U.S. Army troops are exposed depend not only on emissions but also on the chemical transformations that occur in air subsequently. Such reactions can also lead to changes in the interactions with soils and aqueous media by altering the chemical and physical properties of the species emitted and/or formed in the atmosphere. These impacts on environmental quality, health and climate can have direct impacts on the Army mission. Particles are particularly important in this regard, especially how they form and grow to - 100 nm where they impact visibility, serve as cloud condensation nuclei to impact climate, and also efficiently reach the deep lung. Organic particles formed by chemical reactions of gaseous precursors (secondary organic aerosol, SOA) dominate the composition in most locations. There are chemical reasons... but virtually no data... that suggest that the composition of the surface layer of organic particles differs from the bulk. This is critical since it is the surface that incoming gases interact with first. and it will interact directly with biological systems such as the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract The goals of the proposed research are to elucidate the chemical composition of the surface layers of atmospherically relevant organic particles and compare these 10 their average bulk composition. The proposed research involves laboratory studies in which (I) well defined model systems with a core and coating of well-defined thickness but different chemical composition will be generated and characterized;(2) SOA particles formed from a variety of organic precursors, both natural and anthropogenic, will be generated and the physical properties such as size distributions measured; and (3) the surface and bulk composition of these two sets of model systems will be probed using new mass spectrometry {MS) approaches.

AP-MALDI-MS (ambient pressure matrix assisted laser desorption ionization MS), MAIV¥MS (matrix assisted ionization vacuum MS); LTP-MS (low temperature plasma MS) and EESI-MS (extractive electrospray ionization MS). The application of many different approaches and use of different mode.1 systems will be key to obtaining a quantitative understanding of the surface layer composition and bow it differs from the bulk. The results of the proposed research will be the development of a quantitative understanding of the composition of the surface of complex organic particles. This will facilitate assessment of the role of organic particles in reducing visibility and in climate change via altering cloud formation and properties. In addition, it will provide insight into how atmospheric reactions determine the interactions of particles with biological systems and their bioavailability.

0,Using Complexions to Fabricate Bulk Nanocrystalline Metals with Enhanced Ductility,United States Department of the Army,to Timothy Rupert,"The technical objective of the proposed effort is to determine how complexions (i.e., structurally distinct interfacial states that are in thermodynamic equilibrium) can be used to enhance both the consolidation of bulk nanocrystalline metals and their mechanical properties. The proposed young investigator effort will focus on three fundamental questions in order to achieve the stated technical objective: Can interfacial structure be used as a new materials design variable to increase the ductility of nanocrystalline metals? How does grain boundary chemical composition influence the formation of such interfacial features, on both the nano- and mesoscale? And can grain boundary free energy be reduced using the same segregating alloying elements, so that damage-tolerant nanocrystalline metals can be created in bulk form? The proposed effort to understanding and quantify the importance of grain boundary structural states and their influence on damage nucleation will utilize a combination of high throughput processing experiments, mechanical testing, cutting-edge characterization, and new materials theory. Mechanical alloying will be used to fabricate Cu-Zr and Cu-Zr-Al alloys, with the goal of maximizing the thickness and boundary fraction of AIFs within the microstructure. Consolidation experiments are proposed to probe the competition between grain growth and densification in the presence of various complexion states. Details of the atomic grain boundary structure and chemistry will be characterized with TEM methods, while segregation patterns through the boundary network will be measured with atom probe tomography. Additionally, local mechanical properties will be measured with small-scale mechanical testing, to probe powder samples and behavior at different locations within a bulk sample. Traditional tensile tests will also be used to measure the global properties of consolidated samples.less","360,000",2016,2019
0,Robustness Increases Variability: A Fundamental Law of Biology (Mathematical Sciences/biomathematics),United States Department of the Army,to Steven Frank,"This work develops a fundamental paradox of system design. The more robust protection a system has against perturbations, the more random variability and failure there will be in the system's components. Suppose, for example, that a system can correct errors arising when it copies its internal data. That robust system correction tolerates a greater error rate in the component subsystems that copy the data. In general, as systems improve in their robustness, their components tend to fluctuate more and decay in performance. That duality between system robustness and component variability and decay helps to understand the intrinsic fragilities of system designs and the ways in which complex systems tend to fail. The proposed work develops these theoretical concepts of how system designs tend to evolve and tend to fail. The theory will be applied to the design of biological and human-engineered systems. In biology, common protective mechanisms work to correct internal errors. For example, when an organism detects that it is too hot or too cold, it stimulates physiological mechanisms to correct its temperature. When DNA is copied, many molecular mechanisms check for mistakes and, when mistakes are found, trigger other molecular mechanisms to correct those mistakes. The better an organism becomes at using additional corrective mechanisms to fix mistakes in its underlying DNA copying mechanisms, the less pressure there is on the underlying mechanisms to avoid errors. Correction at the system level allows sloppiness of the underlying components. How does that duality between system correction and component sloppiness actually happen in biological designs? Why do some components vary a lot whereas other components vary only a little? How does the variability or failure of system components lead to disease? To analyze these questions, the proposed work will develop mathematical and computer models of evolutionary process in relation to the dynamics of robust design. This work will use the improved theoretical understanding to enhance how we analyze specific problems in biology. For example, humans have a complex set of layered protective mechanisms to repair DNA and cellular damage, and to limit the growth of cells that are damaged beyond repair. How, through evolutionary history, does such a complex layering of protective mechanisms actually evolve? In theory, each additional protective mechanism reduces the pressure on the efficacy of the existing mechanisms, because the new protective mechanism will correct some of the mistakes that passed through the prior corrective systems. Thus, the layering of each new protective mechanism allows greater variability and failure in the existing mechanisms. The final overall system design is a seemingly overwired and highly variable set of components. And that is exactly how cancer protective mechanisms and much of biological system design actually look. How do fragilities in such overwired systems with weakened components arise, and how do systems tend to fail? This proposal will improve understanding of those questions through explicit theory and through application of the concepts to specific problems, including the complex molecular wiring of cellular control systems and the tendency for some molecular components to vary a lot between cells. This project will also apply the biological theory to problems of systems designed by human engineering, such as computer data storage systems. In addition, social systems in both biology and in human organizations often have layered corrective mechanisms to protect against errors. How do the robust corrective mechanisms in social systems lead to variability and failure in the individual components of the system? How does the duality between system robustness and component decay lead to fragilities in social organizations and in command and control hierarchies?less","360,000",2020,2023

0,Extreme Meta-Optical Fiber Enabled by Gate-tunable Metasurfaces and Zero-index Materials,United States Air Force,to HOWARD LEE,"Optical fiber is a well-known example of a way to guide and manipulate light. It has been used extensively in various applications including long distance optical communication, light generation using fiber lasers, remote and optical sensing, fiber imaging in endoscopes, and fiber laser surgery. Although a dielectric optical waveguide is very efficient for transmitting light, its functionality is somewhat limited by the dielectric material of the core, which has poor electronic, magneto-optical, and nonlinear-optical responses and has the dielectric diffraction limit. Therefore, the optical properties of the optical fiber waveguide such as phase, amplitude, polarization state, and mode profile cannot be modulated after the fiber drawing fabrication, thus limiting the development of novel in-fiber optical devices. The long-range goal of the proposed research project is to develop effective methods for designing advanced optical applications using novel zero-index materials and metasurfaces-based optical fiber applications. The objective in this research project is to develop efficient tunable 'meta'-optical fibers with reconfigurable functionality such as phase modulation, enhanced magneto-optical properties and light emission-lasing effects by merging the advantages of three distinct sciences, i) tunable transparent conducting oxide-metallic nitride epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, ii) optical metasurfaces, and iii) nano-micro-structured optical fibers.

The project will investigate the teeth and stylus (flexible support of the teeth) from a number of chitons found in ecologically diverse regions of the world, and examine the differences in the multiscale architectures and mineral components of the teeth. It will reveal how the underlying organic framework is utilized to control the nucleation, growth and phase selection of mineral. The researchers will use modern spectroscopic and microscopic techniques and nanomechanical testing to uncover the material hierarchy, phase evolution pathways and mechanical performance of chiton teeth. The researchers will also use proteomic analysis of the chitons to understand how functional proteins dictate phase selection and transformation. Specifically, the researchers will (i) resolve the multiscale structural features and mechanics of mature teeth, (ii) investigate the underlying organic framework (structural and chemical) that controls phase selection and regulates nucleation and growth of mineral in the teeth, (iii) understand a universal biomineralization system and protein function in chitons with respect to regulating crystallization and phase and (iv) validate organic-mineral interactions via in-vitro crystallization studies and translate to multifunctional architectures by fabricating biomimetic wear resistant structures. Significance: This project has broad importance and implications for materials science. There is a need to develop new generations of high-performance multifunctional materials for a wide range of applications, ranging from energy storage and conversion to high-strength/low-weight structural materials. Biological systems, with their multitude of elegant solutions to similar dilemmas, can thus provide important inspiration to achieve similar goals in wholly synthetic systems. Beyond structural materials, the lessons learned from the biologically inspired materials synthesis aspect of this research could provide new insight into the factors controlling crystal nucleation and growth, translatable to the synthesis of nanostructured materials with broadbased applications. Here, project researchers will do this by studying the organic scaffolding and function within a broad range of mineralized teeth from chiton found in ecologically diverse regions, the hierarchical structure and mechanical behavior of these teeth as well as the stylus connecting the radular belt to the teeth of chitons. These material systems have been chosen for this study due to (i) their remarkable damage tolerance and abrasion resistance (exhibiting the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date) from their heavily mineralized protective coatings, (ii) their multicomponent, hierarchical architectures, (iii) their unique and dynamic mineralization processes and (iv) the broad range of material and architectural features initially observed in radular teeth that come from ecologically diverse regions. By investigating the mineralization and multiscale behavior of these unique multicomponent flexible, abrasion-resistant and damage-tolerant structures, the proposed research will develop the necessary tools for the design and fabrication of cost-effective, environmentally friendly and high performance multifunctional materials.

0,Towards a Third Generation of Interference Alignment - Low Latency Interactive Directional Networking,United States Department of the Navy,to SYED JAFAR,"Objective: Interference Alignment (IA) is a transformative idea that is essential to approach thecapacity limits of wireless networks. A variety of interference alignment schemes have shown thatin theory the capacity limits of wireless networks are orders of magnitude higher than what ispossible through current state of art interference management schemes. Focused on asymptotictheoretical guarantees of optimality, the first generation of IA schemes relied on a number ofidealized assumptions, such as precise channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT),instantaneous feedback, unlimited channel diversity, and asymptotically high (signal to noisepower) SNR levels, which made them difficult to translate into practice in traditional wirelesssettings. The second generation of IAschemes focused on departing from idealized assumptionsbut still adhered to classical models of wireless networks with trivial connectivity assumptions,isotropic transmission, and unbounded latency. We envision future networks that are based ondirectional networking using intelligent reconfigurable antennas to provide interactivecommunication with low latency. This new paradigm opens the doorto the next wave of innovationin interference alignment the third generation of interference alignment that is the goal oftheproposed research.Technical Approach: The proposal is comprised of 4 key thrusts. The first thrust explores thepotential for new IAsolutions based on Intelligent Reconfigurable Antennas. Where we previouslyhad dumb reconfigurable antennas capable of switching between random isotropic modes wenow have intelligent reconfigurable antennas that can not only choose the direction of transmissionbut also take advantage of any available channel knowledge to choose optimal switching patterns.The second thrust explores the potential for shaping and exploiting network topology throughdirectional transmission. Where we previously had only convex connectivity patterns due toisotropic transmission models we now have the possibility of creating specialized non-convexconnectivity patterns due to directional antennas. These connectivity patterns can be optimized forvarious communication and/or computation tasks that arise in a tactical network. The third thrustis focused on low latency (short) multiuser codes for sporadic erasures. The goal of this thrust isto develop multiuser erasure codes for sporadic erasures that may result from transientmisalignments of beams due to fluctuating connectivity. The fourth research thrust exploresanother challenging direction interactive communication. Where we previously considered onewaycommunication, or even two-way communication with independent flows in each direction,we may now be able to exploit causal dependencies that arise naturally in interactivecommunication.Anticipated Outcomes and Significance to DoD: Success along these objectives will usher in a3rd generation of IA schemes that bring the theoretical advantages of IA close to practice, allowunprecedented spectrum efficiency along with low latency for interactive communication.

The method is based on recent discoveries related to novel dispersion engineering via metamaterials and photonic band gap structures that have shown that multiple degenerate eigenmodes in a waveguide are able to strongly interact with an electron beam and absorb power from it. The proposed regime of operation is particularly useful to realize very high power oscillators and amplifiers that are highly efficient in terms of power consumption. The research activity will be devoted to explore practical designs of such electron-beam driven devices. Metallic waveguide structures will be designed and fabricated that are capable to guide degenerate electromagnetic waves. Experimental verifications of the existence of such degenerate regime will be conducted at millimeter waves (this has never been demonstrated yet). Demonstration of electron-beam-driven sources of radiation with high power efficiency will be conducted using state of the art simulators, and if possible via experiments with collaborators. Highly confined electron beams require expensive equipment and very large magnets. The proposed novel method will lead also to devices with a relaxed electron beam requirement that are much smaller and less expensive than current ones, still guaranteeing the quality of single frequency of radiation. The method described above based on the degeneracy of multiple electromagnetic waves in a waveguide is advantageous until the beam assumes very intense values and the advantage degrades with the intensity of the beam. In the second part of the research this limitation will be removed by exploring a novel regime based on achieving degeneracy with the presence of a very intense electron beam, leading to extremely high power beam-based oscillators and amplifiers that are at the same time very efficient.less","299,991",2018,2021

0,Squeeze-Grown 2D Topological Insulators for Room Temperature Quantum Devices,United States Air Force,to JAVIER SANCHEZ,"2-Dimensional Topological Insulators (2D TIs) offer the potential for dissipation-less electronic wires, a means to pump and transport spin, and a route towards hardware-protected quantum computing. Despite 15+ years of research, 2D TI effects have been limited to cryogenic temperatures and short micron-scale distances. This proposal aims to realize a 2D TI that can operate under a wide range of conditions, including room temperature, and can be coupled with other quantum materials and spin systems. We will achieve this goal by growing 2D monolayers of bismuth, a large band gap 2D TI. Our unique approach is to produce 2D bismuth by a squeeze growth technique, where pressure and heat are used to reduce the dimensions of a 3D bulk crystal to a 2D form. We will undertake an iterative feedback process of growth and materials characterization, which will be guided by computational studies of the growth process. Once we have achieved monolayer 2D bismuth, we will measure its transport properties and test for the presence of helical edge modes – the hallmark of a 2D TI state. We will also study the interaction of the helical edge modes with proximal quantum spins by performing resistively-detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The success of this research will enable a fundamental understanding of transport in the helical edge state of a 2D TI and will establish a platform for coupling helical modes with quantum spins and other quantum materials. A robust 2D TI will also enable technological applications towards quantum computing and low-power electronic and spintronic devices. The successful development of our 2D squeeze growth technique will also provide a new general approach to creating low-dimensional crystals.less","250,001",2021,2023

0,Molecular Level Understanding of Degradation of Insensitive Munitions on Soil Proxies as the Basis for Developing Chemical Footprints,United States Department of the Army,to Barbara Finlayson-Pitts,"New explosives and propellants are continuously being developed by both the U.S. and by other nations. Once in the environment, they may degrade through a number of mechanisms, forming new products. As such, their chemical signatures will be different than those of the parent munitions. Developing fingerprints to identify munitions that were used therefore requires a molecular level understanding of how these agents are transformed in the environment and how fast this occurs in various media in which they are found. Insensitive munitions (IM) such as IMX-101 are being developed that will become widely dispersed in water, on soil surfaces and as solid particles. Over the past few years, studies of the degradation of IMX-101 and its components in aqueous systems have been reported, but far less is known regarding their reactions as solids or adsorbed compounds. Studies of degradation by atmospheric oxidants (such as OH radicals) and of the gas phase products are also lacking. Thus, there are major gaps in our knowledge of IM degradation products that are central to their chemical fates and transport, and hence to assessing their environmental forensics. We propose to study reactions with OH radicals and direct photolysis of IMX-101 and its individual components as (1) thin solid films on infrared transmitting crystals and on proxies for environmental surfaces such as dust and soil, and (2) as particles suspended in air. Knowledge of gas and solid phase products generated simultaneously will provide unique molecular level insights into the mechanisms involved. These studies will also provide fundamental data such as quantum yields over three different wavelength regions that are essential for quantitative assessment of the IM lifetimes and fates in the environment under a variety of selected conditions (e.g., season, location, time of day). Effects of particle size on kinetics, products and mechanisms is an important part of the proposed research, since both size and composition can impact particle reactivity and products. These studies will additionally provide insight into organic particle composition differentiated by size and by surface versus bulk composition, a project currently funded by ARO. A variety of techniques will be applied, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for loss of the parent compound and formation of solid products and gases. The mixture of solid products is likely to be sufficiently complex that separation prior to analysis by light absorption and mass spectrometry is critical. A combined ultra performance liquid chromatograph interfaced to a photodiode array detector and mass spectrometer is therefore requested. In addition, a scanning mobility particle sizer is needed to characterize and size-select the solid particles. The requested instrumentation is critical for providing specific identification and quantitative analysis in the complex mixtures of reactants and products. The results of these studies will be a better understanding of the environmental fates and forensics of IMX-101 and its components. Both this project and one currently funded by ARO address chemical fates of compounds of relevance to ARO/DoD, and provide the fundamental, molecular level understanding that is needed to predict future transformations of these compounds. This instrumentation will provide training for the next generation of scientists who will contribute to ARO/DoD research. The PI traditionally has a research group that consists of students from high school to undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and project scientists. They are overwhelmingly from underrepresented groups in STEM, particularly women. In addition, we share instrumentation across groups and thus it will find even broader use and provide training to many students outside the PIÕs own group.less","236,454",2020,2021
0,IA 2: Intent-Capturing Annotations for Isolation and Assurance,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Per Larsen,"Software and hardware flaws can be exploited to make programs perform unintended computations or leak sensitive data. We propose to counter these threats by isolating libraries and other program units inside a single process. The developer will insert source-level annotations that i) map code and data units to compartments and ii) capture how each compartment is intended to interact with others, iii) enumerate the privileges required by code in each compartment. We will develop a compartmentalization substrate that enforces the captured intents by i) limiting the control and data flows between compartments to those strictly necessary for the program to operate correctly, and ii) limiting privileges of untrusted compartments. We will use features added to modern processors to make switches between compartments more efficient than context switches between processes while providing comparable isolation and security properties.  We will ensure that the resulting technique will remain compatible with and complement existing defenses thus providing another layer of security that reduces the blast radius of as-of-yet undiscovered vulnerabilities. The technology we develop must be deployable, therefore we will aim for solutions that have negligible performance overheads, make few demands of developers, and remain fully compatible with most if not all existing code.less","224,988",2020,2021
0,Complex Networks for Computational Urban Resilience (CONCUR),Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Timur Chabuk,"CONCUR develops a computational framework for assessing and characterizing urban environments stability or fragility in response to volatility and stress, identifying specific weaknesses as well as key tipping points which could lead to rapid systemic failure. CONCUR explicitly models urban environments as emergent complex systems, focusing attention on the critical triggers that could lead to rapid transformations from robust to fragile. CONCUR ingests both social media and archival data using an already developed tool, identifying key indicators of urban functions and potential disruptors. CONCUR quantifies these indicators importance to the environments stability and incorporates them into a conceptual ontology, characterizing the urban terrains ability to maintain stability and provide civil services and governance. CONCUR weighs the impact that these indicators and their causal inter-linkages have upon each other across time, and produces a resilience score, characterizing the urban environments fragility and forecasting its likelihood to become feral. CONCUR uses cutting-edge analytics to identify specific weaknesses in infrastructure and services and to identify emerging tipping points that could lead to instability and rapid system failure.

0,Nanostructured High Entropy Alloys,United States Department of the Army,to Enrique Lavernia,"The technical objective of the proposed effort is to establish design principles for structurally efficient nanostructured high entropy alloys with engineered phases and microstructures enabling strength and ductility values that exceed those of conventionally processed alloys. The proposed effort is motivated by the opportunity to synthesize nanostructured high entropy alloys (HEAs) that are thermally stable and mechanically strong with good ductility. The proposed research seeks to dramatically alter HEA synthesis and uncover new design pathways that are based on fundamental knowledge of the underlying phenomena, rather than on trial and error approaches. More specifically, the technical approach is organized into three primary thrusts. First, the research will seek to apply severe plastic deformation techniques to ingot HEAs prepared by arc melting and casting. Second, the proposed work will investigate mechanical and physical behavior of not only macroscopic samples, but also in-situ deformation and indentation techniques, to provide mechanistic information related to defect characteristics (e.g., dislocation density and grain boundary characteristics). Third, the proposed effort will utilize advanced characterization techniques to understand microstructural characteristics in nanostructured HEAs. The microstructural factors that affect the thermal stability of nanostructured HEAs will be established, paying special attention to the influence of defects on phase transformations, grain and GB structures, and precipitates. The proposed effort will use the AlCoCrCuFeNi system as a model material system, due in large part to the availability of most chemical and physical data needed for the analyses.less","181,283",2016,2017
0,Self Assembly of Conductive Fibers from Bioinspired Peptides,United States Air Force,to ALLON HOCHBAUM,"Bioelectronic materials aim to interface synthetic electronic devices with biological systems, from biomolecules to cells, tissues, and entire organisms. The union of solid state and biomaterials enables applications such as wearable or implantable devices, portable and biocompatible power sources, real time sensors, and neural interfaces. Proteins and peptides are ideal building blocks due to their properties of biocompatibility, self assembly and molecular recognition. The design and understanding of long range electronic conductivity in protein and peptide biomaterials is a quickly growing field of interest. Long range electron transport (> um) is a rare but established phenomenon in biology, and little is known about the conduction mechanisms. Inherent electronic conductivity has been established in anaerobic bacterial protein fiber appendages that also exhibit extreme environmental stability. Taking inspiration from these conductive appendages, previous AFOSR funded work in the Hochbaum lab designed a self assembling de novo peptide system based on a novel coiled coil interaction motif, the Phe Ile zipper. The resulting antiparallel coiled coil hexamers (ACC Hex) form nanofibers that are conductive and serve as direct electron transfer supports for enzymatic electrocatalysis. Here, we propose to develop scientific insights into the assembly, environmental stability, and properties of functional, supramolecular peptide materials. Mutable residues in the hydrophobic ACC Hex core and on the solvent exposed surface will be modified to explore the limits of thermodynamic stability of these protein supramolecular assemblies under extreme conditions. New interaction motifs will be designed to support specific interactions between ACC Hex building blocks for robust mechanisms of fibrilization. Lastly, fibers developed through these studies will be used as conductive immobilization supports for enzyme electrochemistry under extreme conditions.less","177,787",2019,2022
0,TRX Multi-Platform Universal Navigation Solution Manager With Redundant Integrity Monitoring,United States Department of the Army,to Carole Teolis,"Military platforms and personnel rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for precision navigation and targeting, to enhance situational awareness, improve command and mission effectiveness, and to operate more safely. However, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS – including GPS and other similar systems such as Galileo, GLONASS) rely on very low-powered signals susceptible to threats from jamming (where the signal is entirely denied) and spoofing (where signals may be generated that lead the platforms and end users to believe they are located in a position other than where they are actually located). GNSS positioning signals can also experience natural errors or denial in dense urban areas, in triple canopy, within buildings, and underground and accuracy can vary based on satellite geometry, atmospheric conditions, and more. A Universal Navigation Manager is proposed which allows real-time “plug and play” of new sensor types to enhance assurance (integrity, accuracy), provides redundant integrity monitoring, increasing assured position availability, reliability, and accuracy and lowers the time, complexity, and cost for integration of new navigation sensors.less","166,494",2019,2020
0,ConnextEdge: A Hierarchical Framework for Resilient Edge Analytics,United States Department of the Army,to Kyle Benson,"The US Army aims to integrate multi-modal sensor data streams and advanced AI analytics at the tactical network edge in support of its vision for a future Internet of Battlefield Things. To maintain situational awareness within mission-acceptable levels despite dynamic conditions and infrastructure disruptions, we propose the ConnextEdge framework for resource-aware location-agnostic adaptive AI processing. This Agile AI methodology makes local decisions about where and how to analyze sensor data. It monitors network connectivity and other system resources (e.g. compute, battery power) and determines whether to process data at a local networked compute device or a remote edge server. This enables more powerful AI algorithms on the edge server to extract relevant information with high accuracy, or low-power less-accurate local analytics to maintain continuity of operations during infrastructure disruptions prevalent in battlefield environments. This effort will incorporate years of experience and novel research on mission-critical edge computing systems with a field-tested TRL-9 communications framework currently deployed in many DoD systems. Our team's strong synergy and existing foundations translates to a low risk to the Army and a shortened timeframe to the completion of both Phase I and II of this effort.less","166,446",2020,2020

0,Ballistic Holography under Realistic Spray Conditions,United States Department of the Army,to Derek Dunn-Rankin,"In summer 2016 UC-Irvine and Metrolaser, Inc. completed a three year National Science Foundation funded Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project and successfully developed and demonstrated a unique, femtosecond, digital holography system for characterizing dense sprays under harsh conditions. The NSF project was successful beyond expectations in providing the fundamental understanding of the technique and demonstration in s11rrogate systems but it did not reach the stage of demonstration under fully rel'l listic sprl'ly conclitions. We propo. c to use A RO Support to heavily leverage our findings from the GOA LI project and extend its impact by including a substantial demonstration phase with the support of colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). This project brings together three research teams with complementary skills comprising optical diagnostics, particularly ballistic imaging and holography, and high-pressure sprays for a unique opportunity to advance Lhe state-of-the-art in spray dynamics imaging. This work is directly relevant to the large field of study addressing spray dynamics and fundamentals including, but not limited to, jet breakup at orifices and ligament formation. An imaging solution to address the lack of data available near the injector orifice for dense sprays has been in high demand for decades from the spray community. The currently available diagnostics anempting ro address this need are limited to ballistic photon imaging (e.g., Linne et al., 2005) and synchrotron x-ray radiography (e.g., Cai et al., 2003). Recent results at CSM have acquired planar image slices from sections of a spray; these images do not include correction for out of plane signal addition from multiple scattering and only two planes can be interrogated simultaneously. For all of these efforts, the capability to resolve the instantenaous and full 30 structure of sprays is not present. Suppressing multiple scattering noise in the frequency domain via ultrashort pulsed off-ax.is digital holography (USPODH) has the potential to provide this significant improvement to the measurements of sprays in the near field, as we have already demonstrated in the GOALI proof-ofconcept research (Ziaee, et al., 2016).

0,Thunderlane,United States Department of the Air Force,to Rian Quinn,"AIS proposes the Thunderlane effort to define a new operating system model that radically dissolves the boundary between hypervisor and operating system, and leverages state-of-the-art software diversity techniques. In concert, these capabilities provide unparalleled resistance against reverse-engineering, and ensure the reliability and security of application and system software. The Thunderlane effort will achieve this goal by leveraging hardware-based virtualization to define a new operating system architecture: the hyperkernel. Similar to a microkernel, each major component in the hyperkernel system executes in isolation, and communicates via well-defined channels that can be tested and verified. Unlike a microkernel, however, the hyperkernel can leverage existing software (both applications and device drivers) designed for monolithic kernels like Microsoft Windows and Linux providing both the reliability and security of a microkernel, with access to existing software. Furthermore, Thunderlane will use compile-, load- and run-time software diversity techniques to protect the hyperkernel. Via a defensive-in-depth approach, Thunderlane is able to both reduce the probability of a successful attack through diversification while reducing the significance and severity of a successful attack through isolation. This diversified hyperkernel architecture is a much needed step towards significantly improving security and reliability of the systems protecting our nations most valuable assets.less","149,988",2016,2017

0,Carbon Nanotube Technology for RF Amplification,United States Department of the Air Force,to Dawei Wang,"ABSTRACT: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential for high performance RF applications. Theoretical study has shown that the electrical current in a CFET is intrinsically linear. Today, linearity is the underlying limitation in increasing the data transport densities of wireless networks. The complex modulation protocols used to achieve higher data rates requires linear amplifiers. Increasing linearity in current bulk semiconductors is done by driving higher currents through large transistor channels and limiting the RF operating region to the most linear portion of the depletion curve. This wastes power and generates heat. The intrinsic linearity of CNTs offers significant improvements in spectral efficiency without sacrificing power. Modeling of past results reveals that the key limitations to achieving superior linearity in CFET devices are contact resistances and Schottky barriers formed at the interfaces between CNTs and their contacting materials. In addition, material purity plays a role in CFET performance. This project addresses the contact resistance issue and the need for high purity channels by combining novel fabrication techniques, and materials. The results of this study are important for guiding subsequent process improvements and for uncovering remaining technological barriers to a manufacturable CFET process technology. ; BENEFIT: High Linearity Amplifiers, mixers and RF components for use in high performance wireless transceivers.

This technique enables study of surface or embedded 3D cracks growing in non-coplanar mode, 2D through crack growing in non-collinear way, and transitioning of 3D into 2D cracks. A large number of benchmark problems will be solved to validate the methodology and case studies will be conducted to demonstrate proposed method""s superiority. In the non-SIF based approach, we explore the use of Peridynamics to study fracture processes and application to fatigue problems. Peridynamics is a non-local approach , where material particles exert influence within a neighborhood distance as opposed to the classical local approach. The most important part in Peridynamics is in the formulation of constitutive laws to express the bond forces between material points. Owing to its formulation expressed in integral forms, it is well suited to discontinuities such as cracks.

Our preliminary estimations show, that the proposed spectrum analyzers can operate without external applied magnetic field, can have frequency bandwidth of the order of 10 GHz, detection time less than 200 ns, and frequency resolution of 50 MHz or better. The operation frequency can be tuned from about 1 GHz to about 20 GHz, either by applying a bias magnetic field (in which case the operational frequency of one device can be tuned dynamically), or by adjusting the geometrical and physical parameters of the devices (in which case the spintronic spectrum analyzers can operate without a bias magnetic field).less","147,538",2016,2017

0,Radical Artificial Intelligence for Multiphase Environmental Systems,United States Department of the Army,to Ann Marie Carlton,"Accurate prediction of the future given a set of chemical reactants is a desirable capability with broad application. Robust estimation of chemical speciation with models at long reaction times is currently too difficult for present computer science techniques due to error propagation over multiple steps and high computational costs. This is true for single-phase chemical systems, and even more challenging for multiphase and interfacial systems. For example, evolution of organic compounds in multiphase systems involves simultaneous sequential and parallel chemical corridors in addition to phase transitions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning lend themselves to chemical discovery in this area, in part, because traditional approaches are difficult when mechanistic pathways are highly branched and convoluted. While the field has some understanding of the multiphase organic phenomena in relatively simple systems, little is known under realistic, non-ideal conditions. Statement of Work: We propose an interdisciplinary chemistry/computer science project to elucidate and explain measured data for multigenerational oxidation systems at the forefront of environmental multiphase chemistry research to provide insights to the critical factors that control and improve predictive skill and seek to answer: To what extent can we achieve human expert skill to predict multiphase chemical reactions for environmentally real systems with Artificial Intelligence? Objectives: 1.) instruct a deep learning system with radical training reactions, 2.) combine radical and polar rule-based chemistry for single step reactions in a deep learning system, 3.) build on the single step approach for combined radical and polar chemistry in multi-generation oxidation, 4.) test and evaluate the deep learning system at all stages of model development. Methods: We propose to use Reaction Predictor, a rule- and machine learning-based system for predicting chemical reactions using deep learning. Reactions are predicted at the level of elementary mechanistic steps that can be chained together to yield complex global reactions. Significance: Multiphase chemistry defines all of the physicochemical transformations between states of matter on scales ranging from nanoseconds to millennia, subatomic particles to solar systems. We cannot predict beyond a few steps in simple systems, and rarely for a non-ideal system. From a chemical perspective, everything is a multiphase process. Evolution of primordial gas and dust, and mass exchange between the phases of the interstellar medium defines the Milky Way as we understand it. Chemical reactions and phase transitions within and between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and pedosphere/lithosphere defines all cycling in the Earth system.

0,High Energy Batteries for Electric Flights,United States Department of the Air Force,to Vinod Nair,"The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of producing novel electrochemical cells with energy density of >500 Wh/kg, capable of recharge rates of 1C, with a robust safety profile. To accomplish this, we plan to use our patented carbon technology to synthesize C/Si composites for the anode and C/S composites (lithiated) for the cathode (all other components will be commercially sourced).  During Phase I, we will synthesize and test the C/Si materials (4 different combinations of Si content and particle size).  We have already measured >500mAh/g on our C/Si composite with 10% Si (and will design the final composite for this application using that information as an input).  The deliverables include electrochemmical test data on all the C/Si combinations synthesized during this phase of the project.  We also plan to synthesize the C/S cathode materials and perform initial materials characerization testing on these.  The goal here is to develop a one-pot process from the carbon and sulfur salt precursors to synthesize a C/S cathode with all the precursors being converted into the final components of the composite. Farad Power's process to synthesize carbons utilizes polymerization of a furfuryl alcohol carbon precursor in the presence of additives. Furfuryl alcohol is a liquid organic compound that is derived from agricultural waste (namely sugarcane bagasse and/or corn cob). It is readily available, inexpensive, and derived from a renewable source. We have studied this system in great detail and have synthesized >100 batches of carbon and carbon composites using this method in our labs.  We have already been granted 8 patents on the technology and have filed several more. The data obtained from Phase I will be used to synthesize and test C/S cathodes during Phase II  - with a goal towards fabricating coin and pouch cells using the C/Si and C/S electrode materials synthesized using our method.  The main advantages of our method include ability to form very uniform and homogeneous mixtures of the C/S and C/Si composites.  This is due to the fact that we use a liquid carbon precursor and mixing a solid powder into a liquid will result in a much homogeneous mixture than mixing two solid powders.  Also, using a liquid carbon precursor with a Si powder will result in a complete coating of the Si particles with a carbon layer (formed after polymerization and carbonization of the furfuryl alcohol precursor).less","132,383",2020,2021

Our recent research demonstrates how complex OA systems can be designed, built, and deployed with alternative components and connectors resulting in functionally similar system versions, to satisfy overall system capability requirements as well as individual OA system component intellectual property (IP) and cybersecurity requirements. These requirements are surfacing new challenges for achieving BBP that can decrease (or increase) software acquisition costs. Our next step proposed here is to investigate the use of smart contracts and associated technologies (e.g., cryptocurrency, domain-specific blockchain transaction languages and computational tools) for specifying shared agreements between multiple parties to acquisition efforts. We believe smart contracts can be computationally enacted during the design, integration, release, deployment, and evolution of cybersecure, modular open architecture software systems in ways that can model, track and analyze the associated contractual obligations and customer rights that drive costs and risks. Smart contracts incorporate computational specifications (i.e., computer programming script code) that enable formal and precise agreements between parties that can entail costing constraints, and production or cybersecurity requirements, that are associated with articulated OA system procurement obligations and rights. The associated technologies for smart contracts are emerging capabilities that enable computational protocols for tracking elemental transactions between multiple parties to a shared contractual agreement. Such agreements can arise, for example, when different program offices, government agencies, commercial firms, and non- profit enterprises decide to share acquisition costs and risks in order to more rapidly assemble, produce, deliver, or evolve innovative cybersecure modular OA software systems.less","119,687",2016,2017

It is possible with recent technological advances that standard transmission radiography may be extended to self-radiography, where the natural radioactivity of the object itself and the surrounding matrix is used as the source of X-rays. Self-radiography is much more complex than traditional radiography, chiefly because it depends on a distributed, non-quantified, and low intensity source. Mirmar Sensor builds high-pressure xenon spectrometers. These detectors provide medium resolution, highly stable, very large, room temperature spectrometers.

0,Field-effect Tunable Titanium Nitride Epsilon-Near-Zero Metasurfaces for Dynamic Manipulation of Thermal Emission,United States Air Force,to HOWARD LEE,"Controlling thermal emission/radiation is important for thermal imaging, gas/chemical sensing, and energy applications. In particularly, one of the major challenges for energy harvesting is to absorb the photon energy within a thin semiconductor film and to minimize the thermal energy lost by the solar cell. Over 60 percent of incident solar energy is lost because of thermalization for radiation above the bandgap and non-absorption for radiation below the bandgap. Therefore, it remains a grand challenge to develop techniques to efficiently control, enhance, and redirect thermal radiation to recycle thermal energy for thermal sensing/imaging and thermophotovoltaic devices. Optical metasurfaces, which are arrays of subwavelength anisotropic light scatterers (optical antennas) that can control the phase and amplitude of the transmitted, reflected, and scattered waves, show promise for breaking thermal radiation characteristics (to exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit for energy conversion efficiency) and manipulating the thermal radiation. In addition, newly emerging epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials enable unique optical functions, such as perfect absorption/emissivity, redirection of optical emission, and abnormally high nonlinearity, showing significant potential as advanced materials for optical/thermal wave manipulation. However, in most previous reports, metasurface/ENZ-nanostructure-based thermal emission control remains static and the metasurface properties are fixed upon fabrication. In addition, realizing thermal meta-structures with high absorptivity/emissivity, thermal stability, high temperature operation, and selective spectral response remains a great challenge.less","100,000",2021,2024

However, a significant challenge remains in operating SPEs in nearinfrared (NIR), particularly at telecom wavelengths (1.3 - 1.5 micrometer), which would enable enhanced low-loss optical network protocols. In this proposal, we aim to advance our understanding of low-dimensional quantum emitters by investigating strained van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. We propose that local strain engineering can lead to quantum confinement of moire excitons in the twisted bilayer heterostructures and facilitate quantum emission in the NIR range. In our proposed system, spatially indirect interlayer excitons (ILEs) exhibit NIR emission via type-II band alignment (i.e., MoSe2-WSe2 at 0.92 micrometer, MoS2-WSe2 at 1.24 micrometer and InSe-WSe2 at 1.77 micrometer), and precise stacking and straining may further enhance confinement of interlayer exciton at the strained moirÃ© potential traps, allowing for single photon emission at telecom wavelengths (Figure 1).Our collaborative team, UCI, KU and AFRL, has multi-disciplinary expertise in strain engineering, quantum nano-optics and two-dimensional (2D) material synthesis. Moreover, we have recently published a collaborative paper on deterministic SPEs via strained transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer. Our collaborative efforts will pave the way for realizing quantum confinement in 2D vdW heterostructures, and further usher in a new class of SPEs with the potential for deterministic positioning and tunable emission at telecom wavelengths.less","100,000",2021,2024
0,BRDF Analysis of LADAR-based Target Surface Characterization,United States Department of the Army,to Xuemin Jin,"LADAR light reflection from a target is highly dependent of the spectral reflectivity and texture properties of the surface.

H-BGK method is to provide automated sub-domain solutions by direct BGK method and the gaskinetic BGK method of Xu (BGKX) in the high and low Kn regimes respectively.  Direct BGK employs the Shakov model using quadratures, i.e., values of the distribution function at certain discrete velocities being used in the integration, and high-order upwind scheme for its solution. The BGKX solver is a finite volume method, proven applicable for thermochemical nonequilibrium flows with accurate heat rate prediction.  The Cartesian method proposed is a Gridless Boundary Condition Cartesian (GBCC) method due to Feng Liu, which is a grid-automated scheme with built-in multigrid to accelerate convergence and has proven applicable to unsteady/steady 3D flows.   Phase I will validate H-BGK solutions with that of DSMC in terms of pressures and heat rates for cylinders and blunt cones at various Knudsen numbers.

In response AS & T Inc. propose, the Conformal Array Laser Imager for Bondline Evaluation and Repair (CALIBER), designed expressly for this purpose. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the integration of a new sensor technology developed by AS & T with a new NDI method, both of which have been independently developed well beyond the conceptual stage. The development of CALIBER will provide an NDI sensor whose output images reveal bondline adhesive strength and the lower threshold which qualify as kissing bonds. In form and function, CALIBER is geared towards field deployment. Founded on a previously successful NDI sensor developed for detection of hidden delaminations, disbonds and crushed core damage in composites, this effort therefore builds upon and broadens the applicability of a new NDI technology.

0,Uncooled VLWIR FPA Using Interferometry,Missile Defense Agency,to William Chan,"""We propose to develop a very long wave infrared (VLWIR) FPA (focal plane array) for missile seeker and space surveillance applications, for which the LWIR region is very important. It consists of a 2-D array of micromachined micro Fabry-Perotinterferometers (FPIs), each of which contains a micro airgap cavity formed by two partially-reflecting mirrors, enclosing a micro-volume of air, and a photvoltaic detector sensitive to visible radiation. One of these mirrors is attached to a movablemembrane that forms one wall of the cavity. When VLWIR radiation falls on the cavity, the movable mirror moves relative to the non-movable mirror due to the heating of the air by the incident VLWIR. This movement causes an interference of the visible lightbeam allowed to incident the cavity, and the inteference amplitude proportional to the heating of the cavity is detected by the visble photovoltaic detector attached to the non-movable mirror. Thus, the photovoltaic detector is highly sensitive to theVLWIR radiation falling on the cavity. The proposed FPA is essentially an array of visible detectors operated at room temperature and fabricated with the 0.25-micron CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) process. Its high VLWIR sensitivity is dueto the interference effect caused by heating of the micro-volume of air in the cavity. Its fabrication involves the CMOS as well as the MEMS (micro electro-optical mechanical system) process technologies.

Integration will increase overall system performance, reduce the PWB real estate consumed in support of each chip, as well as reduceassembly costs and improve reliability. OCI envisions the use of a polymer insulated metal substrate onto which layers of resin-coated foil with conductive-paste-filled microvias and layers of copper foil bearing thick film capacitors and resistors arelaminated to produce a high speed, functionally integrated electronic package.

The proposed approach integrates the high performance and reliability of thick film passive devices with conventional copper wiring and thespace savings of solid microvias. A metal substrate, in addition to providing integral thermal spreading and dissipation, will provide a flat surface to facilitate etching of very fine features. OCI's solution differs from other approaches in that itintegrates a metal substrate, resin-coated foils, solid microvia, embedded passives and active cooling technology directly into the package. Competing polymer-package integration approaches lack integrated thermal management and tend to focus on standardparallel processing of multiple circuit substrates with plated through holes to interconnect circuit layers and access the embedded passives. OCI's solution will provide substantially higher circuit density, lower parasitics, and excellent thermalmanagement - particularly in harsh environments. Successful completion of this research will provide solutions to a wide array of military and commercial electronic devices/products. Integrated passives will facilitate miniaturization of electronic products and integrated electronic cooling will improvereliabililess","66,141",2001,2002
0,Revealing and tailoring mechanical behaviors of multi-principal element alloys under extreme thermomechanical conditions,United States Department of the Army,to Penghui Cao,"The objective of the proposed research aims at revealing extraordinary mechanical behaviors enabled by short-range order in multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), with the goal of improving material strength and toughness via tuning the degree of local ordering under extreme thermomechanical environments. MPEAs, or complex concentrated alloys, including medium-/high-entropy alloys that comprise multiple principal elements in high concentration, are typically considered to be ideal solid solutions. This ideal random mixing in MPEAs, however, may only be possible at high temperatures. As the temperature decreases, the enthalpic contribution to total free energy may become predominant, leading to chemical inhomogeneities such as local chemical order (LCO) and segregation. Interestingly, the nanoscale chemical ordering analogous to coherent nanoprecipitate largely impacts the mechanical behaviors of MPEAs. This suggests that the degree of local ordering, which can be tailored under thermomechanical conditions, provides a new avenue for tuning mechanical behaviors of MPEAs. In this proposed project, we will reveal and demonstrate the role of LCO on strength, hardness, and deformation homogeneity (ductility) in MPEAs under combined thermal and mechanical loading conditions. The specific goals are to address the following scientific yet technically relevant questions: (1) How does the degree of local chemical order influence mechanical strength and deformation behaviors of MPEAs? (2) Can LCO promote extra slip and twinning processes at high stress and high strain rate to accommodate impact loading, improving material resiliency under extreme conditions? (3) What are the kinetic processes resulting in a great range of LCO and mechanical properties? We hypothesize that, by exploiting the access energy from extreme thermomechanical environments, the MPEAs can attain extraordinary mechanical strength and toughness, resulting from local chemical ordering that brings massive hardening mechanisms. This central hypothesis will be tested in CrCoNi alloy (a medium entropy alloy with an extraordinarily high toughness) using a set of computational techniques, including molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), accelerated MD, climbing image nudged elastic band (NEB) method. These computational tools will reveal mechanistic insight into how the MPEAs with different degrees of local ordering respond in extreme thermomechanical environments, laying the groundwork for exploiting the strong and tough MPEAs in stress-adaptive structures.less","60,000",2021,2022

0,Tensor methods for large-scale learning,United States Department of the Army,to Animashree Anandkumar,"Learning hidden structures in n-ary relationships inherent in massive amounts of data that are typically generated could lead to state space explosion if handled in a straight forward way. For this STIR work, the PI will address questions of theoretical guarantees that can be obtained with tensors as intentional representation of the data sets. The PI will investigate how to build intentional tensor representations of the n-ary relationships with the proviso that the data structure is built only if needed. The goal is to then construct lower dimensional subspace, where the actual data resides, which then can be used for Machine Learning applications. The approach that the PI will take in showing efficacy of the proposed tensor representation is to show that the errors can be bounded. The PI will also start implementation of the tensor representations to support her theoretical guarantees.less","50,000",2016,2017

0,Uncooled MWIR and LWIR Imaging using Non-degenerate Two Photon Absorption with Custom InGaAsP Detector Arrays,United States Department of the Air Force,to Martin H. Ettenberg,"Princeton Infrared Technologies, Inc. (PIRT) will team with University of California Irvine (UCI) to develop a room temperature imager with detectivity from 3 to 12 ?m spanning mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and longwave infrared (LWIR) spectral range using non-degenerate two-photon absorption.  This novel detection strategy captures MWIR/LWIR images at high pixel densities, high sensitivity, and low noise without cooling.  Currently, MWIR and LWIR imaging requires expensive low-bandgap semi-conducting materials, such as HgCdTe.  Cooled cameras that are commonly used to cover the entire 3 to 12 ?m spectrum have low pixel densities such as 128x128, precluding the use of high definition (HD) sampling for acquiring high quality videos in use for applications such as microscopy and hyperspectral imaging.  In this program, the team will deliver a 1280x1024 resolution camera using a custom InxGa1 xAsyP1-y array integrated with optics and high speed lasers that operate at room temperature to image light from 3 to 12 ?m at video rates.less","49,972",2021,2021
0,2018 Controversies Colloquium: Stability of Nanostructures,United States Department of the Army,to Timothy Rupert,"The proposed new workshop series, called the Controversies Colloquium is aimed at providing a venue where a small-group of thoughtleaders and subject matter experts can gather to discuss long-standing or new ÒcontroversiesÓ in our field. The first of these proposed workshops is on the subject of the Stability of Nanostructures, and is scheduled to occur February 1-2, 2018 at the University of California, Irvine in Irvine, CA. To unravel the complex phenomena associated with nanostructured material stability, two key controversies will be critically debated: 1) Is true stability achievable in nanostructured materials and how can it be substantiated? 2) Are thermally-stable boundaries also mechanically-stable? The central concept of this workshop is in stark contrast to the status-quo workshop presentation format wherein speakers give a series of presentations, and minimal time is left for critical discussion. The following summarizes the planned formats: - Discussion Leader: Intro and Summary The discussion leader should communicate with the three presenters in his/her panel, to obtain an understanding of the content of their presentations. Based on this, the discussion leader will provide background knowledge necessary to delve into these topics, as well as identify controversial areas where our current understanding can be questioned. - Speaker A classic presentation, but with a focus on presenting evidence of unexplained phenomena and/or brand new exciting work. A panel discussion will follow, to allow most questions to be discussed in a more interactive fashion. - Flipped Classroom Discussion The assigned speaker is responsible for writing a 2-3 page white paper on an open question, unexplained phenomenon, or area for rapid growth in the near future. All attendees will read this before the meeting, to come ready for a high-level discussion. - Chalk Talk The presenter will give a talk on a topic related to the stability of nanostructures, but use a whiteboard for all schematics and talking points. The audience will ask questions in the same format that students would be expected to in class. The basic idea is to force ourselves to condense our ideas into a form that can be easily expressed in a simple diagram, equation, etc., rather than a complicated schematic or graph. These non-traditional small-group presentation and discussion formats will encourage and promote free-flowing scientific dialogue and critical debates. The structure is intended to inspire a highly active meeting where all participants are constantly engaged.less","25,000",2018,2018
0,A workshop on creation of an artificially intelligent organic chemist: applied machine learning for multiphase chemistry,United States Department of the Army,to Ann Marie Carlton,"Accurate prediction of chemistry given reactants and a set of conditions is a desirable capability in many fields, yet is only possible for simple systems. Environmental Chemistry and specifically, multiphase organic chemistry deals with the physicochemical transformations between gaseous, liquid and solid matter on scales ranging from nanoseconds to millennia, molecules to solar systems. Evolution of organic compounds in multiphase systems is inherently more complex than single-phase counterparts because there are simultaneous sequential and parallel chemical corridors in addition to phase transitions. These multi-phase organic transformations are essential for all life on Earth. While the field has some understanding of the multiphase organic phenomena in relatively simple systems, little Is known under realistic complex conditions and there are almost no data on radical-driven chemistry in thin film systems when complex, often highly concentrated and non?ideal mixtures of water, organics and inorganics are present. Furthermore, in such complex systems not only the composition and chemistry can change on the nanoscale, but also the phases involved. Historically predictive approaches for multiphase chemistry describe relatively simple mechanisms that explain oxidation or hydrolysis of a very limited number (or single) species, or a simplified partitioning system at equilibrium due, in part, to computational constraints. Machine learning lends itself to such systems because traditional chemical approaches, such as explicit 'hand-written' mechanisms, are impossible when systems are highly non-linear and the probabilistic nature is non-trivial. The overall purpose is to identify strategies that capitalize on computational approaches to solve complex chemistry. A major theme is to bring together a group of 20-25 researchers representing a cross-section across multiphase chemistry and computation to identify critical open questions in computational chemistry for multiphase systems, as well as formulate protocols for answering those questions. A combination of experiments involving theory, numerical simulations, lab and field experimentation is anticipated. The steering committee will prepare five open and fundamental questions for presentation on the first day. Each question will be presented by an invitees paired as chemist and another researcher (e.g., computer scientist). Each presenter will critique and refine the question from their unique science perspective. As a group and in breakouts attendees will conduct thought experiments.less","15,052",2018,2019
0,Workshop: AI for thermal energy science,United States Department of the Navy,to Yoonjin Won,"APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE -Workshop: AI on Thermal Energy Science will be held at the Susan and Henry Samueli Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building (ISEB), Irvine, CA, April 17-18, 2023. The workshop is created to enhance conversations across multiple disciplines to discuss the role of advanced AI and machine learning techniques in thermal energy science and applications. Recent innovations in AI and machine learning uniquely offer the potential for collecting new types of physically meaningful features that have not been addressed in the past, making their insights available to other domains, and solving for physical quantities based on first principles for multiphase thermofluidic systems. Experimental imaging data may also be coupled with scientific machine learning models. Successful studies under this theme will provide a holistic description of heat and mass transfer by resolving the underlying physical phenomena and finding hidden mechanisms, thereby pushing theknowledge boundaries of thermal energy science. To pursue this research theme, we will initiate conversations between multiple disciplines, e.g., computer science, data science, graphic science, and heat transfer community, to discuss further how AI tools advance the fundamental understanding of heat transfer physics and predict them. The format of the workshop allows for easy interactions between researchers and places a special emphasis on formaland informal exchanges between researchers from academia, government agencies, and industry. This workshop will consist of invited keynote speakers, panels from government, industry, and academia, breakout sessions, and poster presentations. This uniquely designed workshop will enable us to address the core ideas of AI technologies, current implementation status, challenges, and future outlooks for thermal energy science.less","15,000",2023,2023
0,2022 Micro Flow and Interfacial Phenomena (FIP) Conference Support,United States Department of the Navy,to Yoonjin Won,"The 2nd Micro Flow and Interfacial Phenomena (FIP) Conference will be held at Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sciences,and Engineering, Irvine, CA, June 20-23, 2022. This conference is the successor of the ""International Conference on Microchannels an,d Minichannels"" (ICMM), held since 2003 and the ""ASME International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels"" (ICN,MM). The inaugural FIP conference was held virtually in 2021. Given the tremendous recent and historic upheaval related to climate,change and the water-energy nexus, the scientific objective of FIP is to bring together the phase change and single-phase heat tran,sfer, multi-phase flow, bio-chemical and bio-medical engineering, and microflow processes communities with an emphasis on energy app,lications having components exhibiting microchannel flow or microscale surface phenomena (e.g., droplets, thin films, bubbles, etc.),. The insights obtained from successful FIP conference and the chapter will pave the way for the implementation of novel methods fo,r transport physics in a range of applications.The FIP conference is one of the premier annual events for researchers in fields rel,ated to transport and interfacial phenomena. During the conference, researchers will discuss the advancements in the fundamental und,erstanding of transport and interfacial physics and how fundamental physics can be related to modern biochemical, biomedical, and en,ergy applications. The conference includes two plenary and nine keynote presentations. The speakers are from various disciplines and, institutions, representing a broad spectrum of fields. The FIP conference provide valuable networking opportunities. The format of, the conference allows for easy interactions between researchers, and places a special emphasis on formal and informal exchanges bet,ween junior researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty) and established researchers. This aspect is part of our mi,ssion and vision totruly advance and incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our research communities. For example, we, provide the youngest generation of researchers a platform to showcase their work to a broad audience as part of our student keynote, award and a poster session. We will lead a couple of breakout sessions to discuss various topics (the potential topics include publ,ishing papers, career paths, and work-life balance, etc). Furthermore, the FIP leadership committee has set the goal of gender pari,ty amongst its committee and all invited speakers. Financial support is essential to bring together such a diverse group of research,ers for an in-person conference.less","8,000",2022,2023
0,"Request for Conference / Symposium Funding: American Association for Crystal Growth and Epitaxy, Biological Crystallization and Self-Assembly",United States Department of the Army,to David Kisailus,"Biological systems, which use extracellular matrices for structural support and defense as well as other functions, are now providing materials science with new opportunities for design and application. These systems adapt to changing ambient conditions, continually refining and adjusting shape through chemical, cellular, and mechanical signaling. The interface between biology and materials science has rapidly emerged to be at the forefront of materials research. Understanding the processes that guide the formation of multiscale features (nano, micro, meso and macro) is critical towards understanding functional aspects as well as new materials and system designs. The concept behind developing biomimetic and bioinspired materials is to adapt designs and interfacial features from complex, multifunctional biological systems, which use natural components, to produce structures with high performance synthetic engineering materials. This requires a systems approach combining the expertise of engineers with life scientists to study, refine and develop materials with complex, hierarchical structures. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to provide an interdisciplinary conference with symposia that will cover topics related to the investigations of self-assembly of organic components, their potential in forming interfaces for subsequent templating of inorganic materials to form complex, hierarchically assembled biological materials. In addition, translation via synthetic analogues towards biomimetic and bioinspired systems will be addressed as well as fundamental topics of crystallization. It will encompass a diversity of fields via invited talks from researchers in materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, physics and chemistry. Leveraging these different fields within one symposium will provide attendees an opportunity to hear different perspectives on a critical and emerging research area that is full of potential to uncover fundamental science as well as new design rules for the development of next generation advanced and complex materials.less","5,000",2022,2022

The encoded tag can be either affixed to, or printed onto, military vehicles. Cost effective laser readers will be used to provide covert and secure operation. The overall goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate a secure sensor for rapid and accurate tracking and identification of distant objects from both aerial and ground locations, which could be used for improved identification of combatants and their weapons within a fusing battle scene. The Phase II program will include the fabrication of a specially designed tag that displays strong backscattering for only one specific angle of incidence while remaining indiscernible to others. Such a tag will act as a Collett-Wolf source, i.e., the source of a partially coherent collimated beam that propagates through turbulent and/or obscure atmospheres better than a fully coherent laser beam. The Phase II program will also include the use of intensity correlations in scattering from moving tags to extract the velocity of the target in real time. During Phase II, an eye-safe and smart laser tagging system will be designed, fabricated, tested, and delivered to the Army.less",2003,‐,
